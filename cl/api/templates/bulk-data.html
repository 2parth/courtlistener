        <h2 id="about">Bulk Data</h2>
        <p>For hackers, legal analysts and anybody else that might want
            them, we provide bulk files containing all of our data. Several
            types of files are available as listed below, but in general the
            files that are available correspond to the major types of data we
            have in our database (presently, Audio Files, Documents, Dockets,
            and, Jurisdictions).
        </p>


        <h3 id="bulk-data">Bulk Data Files</h3>
        <p>
            Two types of bulk file are available for each core data type in
            CourtListener. The first is a gzip-compressed bulk file containing
            everything in the system for that type of data in a specific
            jurisdiction. The second is a tar file of all the jurisdictional
            gzip archives for a requested type of data. In general, the scheme
            for the bulk files is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-data/<strong>$data-type</strong>/<strong>$jurisdiction</strong>.tar(.gz)?</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some examples:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>All documents (opinions) from the First Circuit of Appeals
                (ca1):
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>

                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All audio files (oral arguments) from the Second Circuit of
                Appeals (ca2):
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>

                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All documents (opinions) from all jurisdictions:</dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>
                        <a href="/api/bulk-data/document/all.tar">https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-data/<strong>document</strong>/<strong>all</strong>.tar</a>
                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All dockets from all jurisdictions:</dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>

                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
            <dt>All jurisdiction data:</dt>
            <dd>
                <blockquote>
                    <code>

                    </code>
                </blockquote>
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Currently, you can download bulk data files for for following
            object types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opinions: <code>document</code></li>
            <li>Oral Arguments: <code>audio</code></li>
            <li>Dockets: <code>docket</code></li>
            <li>Jurisdictions: <code>jurisdiction</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These files are generated using the <a href="{% url "rest_index" %}">REST
            API</a> and follow the schemas described there. The files inside
            the tar archives have names corresponding to the ID of each item,
            and are formatted as JSON. If you wish to see a sample file, we
            advise selecting a small or secretive jurisdiction (such as the
            FISA court) and using that to get an idea of what the bulk files
            contain.
        </p>
        <p>A list of all current jurisdictions is on the right and we regularly
            add new jurisdictions. To monitor for new jurisdictions, you may
            want to look at the <a
                    href="{% url "rest_index" %}#jurisdiction-endpoint">Jurisdiction
                endpoint</a> of the REST API.
        </p>


        <h3 id="citation-data">Citation Bulk Data File</h3>
        <p>
            A new file that is available in the latest updates to our bulk
            data system is a CSV that contains all of the citations
            relationships between opinions in our database. This file currently
            has more than eleven million lines, one per citation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This file can be obtained in a similar manner to the core data
            types, by downloading the file that's available at:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>
                <a href="/api/bulk-data/citation/all.csv.gz">https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-data/citation/all.csv.gz</a>
            </code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The format of the file is two columns: <code>document_id</code> and
            <code>citation_id</code>. The first column is the document that
            references the <em>citation object</em> for the second. A document
            can be looked up for a citation object using the
            <code>citation</code> REST endpoint, or using the
            <code>document</code> bulk data file.
        </p>


        <h3 id="citegeist">The CiteGeist Bulk Data File</h3>
        <p>
            On the 15th of each month, we re-generate the
            <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2013/11/12/courtlistener-improves-search-results-thanks-to-volunteer-contributor/">
                CiteGeist scores
            </a>
            for the entire collection. Since a single new citation can have a
            ripple effect across the entire citation network, we store these
            values in a flat file rather than in our database. This saves us
            from having to update millions of records every month.
        </p>
        <p>
            This file can be obtained with:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <code>curl -O
                https://www.courtlistener.com{% url "pagerank_file" %}</code>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When inspecting this file, you will find two columns of data. The
            first column corresponds to the ID numbers of the items in our
            opinion database, and the second value corresponds to the CiteGeist
            score for that item.
        </p>


        <h3>Generation Times</h3>
        <p>
            As can be seen on the public <a
                href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=michaeljaylissner.com_fvcq09gchprghkghqa69be5hl0@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles">CourtListener
            maintenance calendar</a>,
            bulk data files are regenerated on the last day of every month
            beginning at 3AM PST. Generation can take many hours, but in
            general is expected to conclude before the 1st of each month. On
            the last day of the month, we do not guarantee that you will get
            either the new or old archives, as archives are updated in place as
            their generation completes. In other words, on the last day of the
            month, do not count on getting up-to-date information until the
            next day.
        </p>



        <h3>Donations</h3>
        <p><a href="http://freelawproject.org">Free Law Project</a> has been
            providing bulk data for many years but is opposed to charging for
            public domain data. However, if you find these files valuable to
            your work, we ask that you seriously consider how much they might
            cost otherwise and consider making a <a href="{% url "donate" %}?referrer=bulk-data">donation</a>
            in a similar amount. Free Law Project is a federally-recognized
            501(c)(3) public charity and a California non-profit public benefit
            corporation. We rely on your support to survive.
        </p>



        <h3>Adding Features and Fixing Bugs</h3>
        <p>Like all Free Law Project initiatives, CourtListener is an open
            source project. If you are a developer and you notice bugs or
            missing features, we enthusiastically welcome your contributions
            <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/tree/master/alert/api/management/commands/cl_make_bulk_data.py">on
                Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there are always more bugs than time.</p>



        <h3>Obsoleted Bulk Data APIs</h3>
        <p>In the past, bulk data files were available by day, month, or year
            for every jurisdiction, and a single file was available containing
            all data. Without community objection, these APIs <a
                    href="https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener/issues/285">were
                sunsetted</a>
            in the fall of 2014.
