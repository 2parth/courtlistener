<opinion_text>     As to Dr. Calhoun, the judgment in his favor is affirmed. As to Dr. Ryan, the finding of the medical malpractice tribunal is to be replaced by the decision of the Appeals Court that the offer of proof of the plaintiffs, if properly substantiated, is sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. The judgment of dismissal as to Dr. Ryan is vacated and the plaintiffs may proceed with their claims.
