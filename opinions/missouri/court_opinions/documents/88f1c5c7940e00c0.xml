<opinion_text>[1] Plaintiff Blackman as a home owner and plaintiffs Cheeseman as tenants filed a multi-count petition for injunction and actual and punitive damages. They sued defendants Barber who are owners and operators of an adjoining airport.

[2] The trial court struck parts of plaintiffs' petition; but it left standing the portions seeking an injunction and also allegations<page_number>Page 73</page_number>
of value depreciation of the owner's land and the tenants' claim to punitive damages.

[3] Defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs' appeal on the ground it is premature. We agree because the trial court's order does not dispose of all the issues and all the parties. <italic>Baumstark v.</italic><italic>Jordan,</italic> <cross_reference>540 S.W.2d 611</cross_reference> [2-4] (Mo.App. 1976); <italic>Caudle v.
