Steven Turner ("Turner") appeals a judgment in favor of the defendant in his suit for damages resulting from a three-car rear-end collision. Turner claims that the jury's verdict in favor of the defendant was against the weight of the evidence, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for new trial on that basis. Because evidentiary support is not a prerequisite to a general defense verdict, we affirm pursuant to Rule 84.16(b). A published formal opinion would have no precedential value, and the parties have been provided with a memorandum explaining the reasoning of the court.
