<opinion_text>[1] Leo and Agnes Burnau sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of section 320.150 RSMo 1978, and money damages for injuries sustained as a result of the statute's enforcement. The trial court dismissed the petition. In the Court of Appeals, Southern District, they contended the trial court erred in not granting injunctive relief because there was a clear showing plaintiff would sustain irreparable harm as a result of his inability to sell fireworks; plaintiff was subject to multiple litigation without such relief; section 320.150 RSMo was unconstitutionally vague; and injunctive relief was the proper remedy preventing enforcement of an unconstitutional statute. They did not assign error to the dismissal of their damage action. The case was transferred to this Court because it involves construction of a statute of this state. The question is whether section 320.150 is constitutional. Affirmed.

When the criminal law in question is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid and attempted enforcement would directly invade a property right causing irreparable injury, equity will enjoin enforcement of the offending statute. <italic>McQueen,</italic> 378 S.W.2d at 453.

The trial court was without jurisdiction to enjoin the statute and properly dismissed the petition for such relief.

[4] The judgment is affirmed.

[5] DONNELLY, C.J., RENDLEN, SEILER, WELLIVER, and GUNN, JJ., and FINCH, Senior Judge, concur.

[6] BILLINGS, J., not sitting.
