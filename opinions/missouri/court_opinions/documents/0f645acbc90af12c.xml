<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Samuel L. Justus was found guilty by a jury of the child molestation in the first degree of his three-year old daughter. The trial court sentenced Justus to ten years imprisonment. Justus appeals his conviction, arguing that the admission of the victim's hearsay statements violated his right to confront and cross-examine the witness against him. On appeal, Justus asserts that the admitted statements are testimonial in nature and, as such, supports his constitutional claim. Judgment affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).
