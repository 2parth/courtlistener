PER CURIAM.

Lloyd Dotson-Bey appeals the denial of his Rule 29.15 motion for post-conviction relief. The motion court's findings and conclusions that Dotson-Bey's appellate counsel was not ineffective are not clearly erroneous. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties.

The motion court's judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).
