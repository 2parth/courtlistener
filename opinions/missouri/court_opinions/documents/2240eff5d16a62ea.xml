</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company appeals from the trial court's judgment entered upon a jury verdict in favor of James C. Moore and Luz B. Elfiki (collectively Homeowners) on Homeowners' Petition alleging breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal. No error of law appears. Rule 84.16(b)(5). An extended opinion reciting the detailed facts<page_number>Page 655</page_number>
and restating the principles of law would have no precedential value. The parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth our reasons for the order affirming the trial court's award of summary judgment, pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Only the claim of breach of fiduciary duty was submitted to the jury.</footnote_body>
