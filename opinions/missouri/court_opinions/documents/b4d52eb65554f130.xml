</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>[2] Appellant, John Deal, appeals the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County denying his Rule 24.035 motion without an evidentiary hearing after he pled guilty to two counts of stealing third offense, RSMo section <cross_reference>570.040</cross_reference> (1994). We affirm.

[3] We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the legal file and find the judgment is not clearly erroneous. As an extended opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose, we affirm the judgment pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).
