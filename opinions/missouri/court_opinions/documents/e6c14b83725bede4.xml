<opinion_text>[3] Defendant Curtis Johnson appeals his conviction after a jury trial of two counts of first degree assault (Counts I and III), in violation of ยง <cross_reference>565.050</cross_reference> RSMo 1994 and two counts of armed criminal action (Counts II and IV), in violation of ยง <cross_reference>571.015</cross_reference>
RSMo 1994, on which he was sentenced to consecutive terms of twenty years on Counts I and III and concurrent terms of twenty years on Counts II and IV. Johnson also appeals from a judgment denying on the merits, after an evidentiary hearing, his Rule 29.15 motion.

[4] No error of law appears and no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.

[5] The judgment is affirmed in accordance with Rules 30.25(b) and 84.16(b).
