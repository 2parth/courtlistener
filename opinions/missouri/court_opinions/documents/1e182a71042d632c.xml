<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Defendant appeals from the judgment entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count of robbery in the second degree, in violation of section <cross_reference>569.030</cross_reference> RSMo (2000).  The trial court found defendant to be a prior and persistent offender and sentenced him to sixteen years imprisonment.

No error of law appears and no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion.  However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.<page_number>Page 119</page_number>

The judgment is affirmed in accordance with Rule 30.25(b).
