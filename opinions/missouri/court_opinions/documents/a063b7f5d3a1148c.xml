<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Darryl Matthews appeals the judgment entered after a jury trial on his convictions for two counts of robbery in the first degree.

We have reviewed the parties' briefs and the record on appeal and find no error. No juris prudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. The parties have, however, been provided a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision in accordance with local Rule 405. The judgment is affirmed under Rule 30.25(b).
