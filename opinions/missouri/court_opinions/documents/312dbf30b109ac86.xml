<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Torry Johnson was convicted by jury of second-degree murder, armed criminal action, second-degree burglary, and stealing. On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions for second-degree murder and armed criminal action. For reasons explained in a Memorandum provided to the parties, we find no error and affirm the convictions.

Judgment affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).
