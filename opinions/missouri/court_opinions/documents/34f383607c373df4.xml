Appellant, Nicholas Smith, appeals from his convictions for first degree assault in violation of Section <cross_reference>565.050</cross_reference>,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> armed criminal action in violation of section <cross_reference>571.015</cross_reference>, and felonious restraint in violation of Section <cross_reference>565.120</cross_reference>. He contends the trial court erroneously sustained an objection to defense counsel's closing argument.  We affirm.

Having reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, we conclude the trial did not err.  An extended opinion would have no jurisprudential value.  We<page_number>Page 644</page_number>
have, however, provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision.  We affirm the judgment pursuant to Rule 30.25(b).
