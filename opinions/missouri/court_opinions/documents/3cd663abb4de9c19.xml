RSMo (1994); four counts of armed criminal action, in violation of Section <cross_reference>571.015</cross_reference> RSMo (1994); one count of attempted robbery in the first degree, in violation of Section <cross_reference>564.011</cross_reference> RSMo (1994); one count of trespass in the first degree, in violation of Section <cross_reference>569.140</cross_reference> RSMo (1994); and one count of possession of a defaced firearm, in violation of Section <cross_reference>571.050</cross_reference> RSMo (1994).  The court found defendant was a prior and persistent offender and sentenced him to a total of 95 years imprisonment in the Missouri Department of Corrections and six months in a medium security institution, with credit for time served given to that six months.

No error of law appears and no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion.  However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.

The judgment is affirmed in accordance with Rule 30.25(b).
