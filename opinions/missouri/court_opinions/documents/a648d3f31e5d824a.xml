[2] Section 847.136 (1939 Mo. Repts.) is in the same language as Section <cross_reference>512.120</cross_reference> RS Mo 1949, V.A.M.S., and the latter section will be discussed.

[3] To this statement plaintiff and defendants have added the following:

<block_quote>      "2. Each defendant (other than defendant Earl Ferrell) filed a motion to dismiss, alleging in substance that the petition alleged a several and not a joint liability on the part of defendants; that the relief sought against defendants did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrences or series of transactions or occurrences, and no question of law or fact common to each such defendant and the other defendants arises or will arise in the proceedings; that the residence of the parties and the place of service of process was as stipulated in Paragraph 4 hereafter; that the court had no jurisdiction in personam, of each such defendant in that service in the county of each such defendant's residence was not authorized by statute, and that the court had no jurisdiction of such defendants.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "3. Defendant Earl Ferrell filed a motion to dismiss, alleging in substance that the alleged agreement referred to in the plaintiff's petition was illegal and a fraudulent agreement in that the<page_number>Page 160</page_number>
plaintiff, by said agreement, proposed to haul for hire without first having procured a permit or a certificate of necessity or other license from the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri, which would authorize him to act as either a common carrier or a contract hauler.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "4. The motions to dismiss were all heard on April 10th 1952; and on such hearing the parties stipulated facts on the motions as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`At all times material to these proceedings, the residence of the parties were in various counties, namely: Plaintiff Ernest E. Tanner resided in Scott County; Defendant Norvin Garner resided in Stoddard County; Defendant Vincent H. Rost resided in New Madrid County; Defendant C. H. Weeks, Jr. resided in Stoddard County; Defendant H. Ferguson resided in Dunklin County; and Defendant Earl Ferrell resided in Scott County. The defendant each owned or operated a theater. None of the defendants had any interest in the ownership or management of the theater or other business of any of the other defendants. The contract set out in the petition was signed by each defendant at his place of business at a time when the other defendants were not present. Process for each defendant was directed to the sheriff of the county of the residence of each such defendant and was served in such county on such defendant. At the time the instrument set out in the petition was executed by the defendants, plaintiff did not and does not now have, own, or have the beneficial use of a license, permit, or a certificate of necessity issued by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri authorizing him to haul for hire either as a common carrier or as a contract hauler.'</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "5. The court sustained each and every one of the said motions to dismiss, as per order made on such April 10th 1952, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`Come the parties herein by their various attorneys and the court takes up the motions of each of the defendants, other than defendant Earl Ferrell, to quash service and dismiss plaintiff's petition; and the various motions having been heard it is ordered that the motions of defendant Vincent H. Rost to Quash Service and Dismiss is sustained. The motion of defendant C. H. Weeks, Jr., to Quash Service and Dismiss is sustained. The motion of defendant Norvin Garner to Quash Service and Dismiss is sustained. The motion of defendant. H. Ferguson to Quash Service and Dismiss is sustained.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`The plaintiff refuses to plead further as to defendants Vincent H. Rost, C. H. Weeks, Jr., Norvin Garner, and H. Ferguson.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`The court grants leave to defendant Earl Ferrell to file amended answer and motion to dismiss; and said motion of Earl Ferrell to dismiss is heard and sustained.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`Plaintiff refuses to plead further as to defendant Earl Ferrell.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`It is therefore ordered that the service as to all defendants except Earl Ferrell be quashed and that the motions of all defendants to dismiss be sustained and that plaintiff's petition be and the same hereby is dismissed and defendants are authorized to go without day and it is ordered that the costs of these proceedings be taxed against the plaintiff.'</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "6. On April 17th, 1952, Appellant filed Notice of Appeal (Caption omitted) as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`Notice of Appeal. Notice is hereby given that Ernest E. Tanner, Plaintiff above-named, hereby appeals to the Springfield Court of Appeals from the judgment entered in this action on the 10th day of April 1952.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "7. The points relied upon by Appellant are as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`a. Section 847.16 (1939) of the Civil Code, Paragraph "(a)" authorizes the joining of the action against all of these defendants on both counts of the petition.</block_quote>

<block_quote>      "`b. The motion of Earl Ferrell was erroneously sustained since it was not a necessary incident to the performance of the agreement by plaintiff that he personally have any Public Service Commission permit since he could not perform the agreement through an agent having such permit; and further, the agreement wouldn't be illegal of itself, but any illegality would consist in the carrying of the films on the highways and not in the making of the contract; besides such matters would be an affirmative defense.'</block_quote>

[4] The language used by plaintiff in his statement of the case is based upon Section <cross_reference>512.120</cross_reference> RSMo 1949, V.A.M.S., which carries forward Section 847.136, 1939. The language used by defendants in the balance of the statement seems to us to follow closely the language used in Section <cross_reference>507.040</cross_reference> RSMo 1949, V.A.M.S., and defendants relied upon that part of Section <cross_reference>507.040</cross_reference>, which we quote as follows:

<block_quote>      "All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action."</block_quote>

[5] We have come to the conclusion that the contract, signed by defendants, did not create against them a liability jointly, severally or in the alternative, so as to give plaintiff any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences and that no question of law or fact common to all of the defendants will arise in any action filed, or which might be filed, by plaintiff on the contract set out in the statement of the case.

[6] The contract was signed by defendants at different places, and probably at different times, and different liabilities were incurred thereby. If one of the defendants did not live up to his or its part of the contract, such defendant would clearly be liable in an action filed by plaintiff, without disturbing in any way the question of the performance by the other defendants of the liability incurred by them.

[7] It is not very clear what reformation of the contract plaintiff seeks; but such contract could not be reformed so as to make any defendant liable for the failure of any other defendant to pay for the services of the plaintiff to any other defendant. In other words, the trial court and counsel for defendants have brought the case squarely under that portion of Section <cross_reference>507.040</cross_reference>, quoted above.

[8] The trial court certainly had the right to dismiss the action as to all defendants, with the possible exception of defendant Earl Ferrell. To make the dismissal as to defendant Earl Ferrell proper, it was agreed that plaintiff had not secured a certificate of public convenience and necessity under either Section 390.060 or Section 390.090<page_number>Page 162</page_number>
RSMo 1949, V.A.M.S., both of said cited statutes being laws of Missouri for 1949.

[9] The suggestion of plaintiff that the dismissal as to defendant Earl Ferrell was erroneously granted, does not appeal to us as even remotely possible, whether plaintiff performed his part of the contract through an agent or by water, and thus avoided the necessity of securing statutory authority.

[10] Rule 20, Title 28 U.S.C.A. of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: "All persons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will arise in the action." That is in almost the identical language of that part of Section <cross_reference>507.040</cross_reference>, RSMo 1949, V.A.M.S., which we have quoted above.

[11] In discussing that rule, as it applied to the jurisdiction of Federal Courts, Martin. Judge of the Sixth Circuit of the Federal Court of Appeals, in Fechheimer Bros. Co. v. Barnwasser, <cross_reference>146 F.2d 974</cross_reference>, 976 said:

<block_quote>      "To assume that each member of the company intended to become personally bound to pay for the uniform of any or every other member would be quite contrary to observation and experience. In the absence of positive averment that such guarantee was made, it will not be assumed from conclusions of the pleader."</block_quote>

[12] We do not think that it can be successfully asserted that persons can be joined as defendants, unless such persons are jointly or severally liable for relief arising out of the contract.

[13] Certainly an agreement to pay plaintiff a certain sum at specified times for services, does not render persons liable in the same action, as was attempted in the case before us.

[14] The case was properly dismissed as to all defendants, and the judgment, so dismissing the case as to all of the defendants so joined, should be approved by us, and the order affirmed.

[15] It is so ordered.
