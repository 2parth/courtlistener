<opinion_text>[1] Brian Keith Maurer appeals from the "JUDGMENT/DECREE OF DISSOLUTION" entered on May 22, 1997 by Family Court Commissioner M. Zane Yates. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

[2] In <underline>Slay v. Slay</underline>, <cross_reference>965 S.W.2d 845</cross_reference> (Mo. banc 1998), our Supreme Court decided this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a family court commissioner's purported judgment which was not signed by a judge. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State ex rel. York v. Daugherty</underline>,<cross_reference>969 S.W.2d 223</cross_reference> (Mo. banc 1998); <underline>In re Burnes</underline>, <cross_reference>975 S.W.2d 266</cross_reference>
(Mo. App. S.D. 1998); <underline>Chick v. Chick</underline>, <cross_reference>969 S.W.2d 387</cross_reference> (Mo. App. W.D. 1998). In the record before us, we have not found a judgment entered by "a person selected for office in accordance with and authorized to exercise judicial power by article V of the state constitution. . . ." <underline>Slay</underline>, 965 S.W.2d at 845. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal because no final, appealable judgment has been entered as required by Rule 74.01.

[3] Appeal dismissed.
