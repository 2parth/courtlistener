<opinion_byline>   PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>[1] Defendant, Darrell Burns, was convicted, after a jury trial, of selling heroin. He appeals from the judgment of the trial court sentencing him, as a prior and persistent offender, to eighteen years' imprisonment, to run concurrently with sentences imposed in previous causes. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed pursuant to Rule 30.25(b).
