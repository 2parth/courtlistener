<opinion_byline>   PER CURIAM:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>[1] This case together with several others<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> was ordered reexamined in light of <italic>Albernaz v. United States,</italic> <cross_reference>450 U.S. 333</cross_reference>, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981). Since all of the courts of appeals rulings were based upon our ruling in <italic>Sours v. State,</italic><cross_reference>593 S.W.2d 208</cross_reference> (Mo. banc 1980) (Sours I) or <italic>Sours v. State,</italic><cross_reference>603 S.W.2d 592</cross_reference> (Mo. banc 1980) (Sours II), the cases were all ordered transferred to this Court. Our examination of the double jeopardy issue made in light of <italic>Albernaz</italic> pursuant to the orders of the United States Supreme Court, appears in <italic>State v. Haggard,</italic><cross_reference>619 S.W.2d 44</cross_reference> (Mo. banc 1981).

[2] The original opinion filed by the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, <italic>Brown v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>607 S.W.2d 801</cross_reference> (Mo.App. 1980), is approved and affirmed and by reference made a part of this opinion. <italic>Sours v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>603 S.W.2d 592</cross_reference> (Mo. banc 1980) (<italic>Sours</italic><italic>II</italic>), <italic>cert. denied, Missouri v. Sours,</italic> ___ U.S. ___, 101 S.Ct. 953, 67 L.Ed.2d 118 (1981); and <italic>State v. Haggard,</italic> <cross_reference>619 S.W.2d 44</cross_reference>
(Mo. banc 1981).

[3] The judgment on appellant's 27.26 motion is reversed, and this cause is remanded with directions to enter a judgment denying appellant's motion as to the judgment and sentence for robbery in the first degree. The court is directed to enter judgment vacating the judgment and sentence in the armed criminal action count, Count II.

[4] DONNELLY, C. J., and SEILER, WELLIVER, MORGAN, HIGGINS and BARDGETT, JJ., concur.

[5] RENDLEN, J., concurs in part and dissents in part in separate opinion filed.<page_number>Page 69</page_number>

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>[7] I join the majority in upholding appellant's conviction for robbery in the first degree.
