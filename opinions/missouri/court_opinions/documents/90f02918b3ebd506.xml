</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Samuel Woods appeals the Circuit Court of Johnson County's Probate Division judgment committing Woods to the Department of Mental Health for care, custody, and control as a sexually violent predator. Woods argues that the judgment was not based on clear and convincing proof that a mental abnormality currently exists that makes him more likely than not to sexually reoffend. We disagree and affirm in this <italic>per curiam</italic>
order. Rule 84.16(b).<page_number>Page 879</page_number>
