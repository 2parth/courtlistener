</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>[1] The state has appealed from a judgment of the trial court wherein an attorney was allowed a fee of $1,000 (taxed as costs in the proceeding and ordered to be paid by the state) for services rendered for an indigent juvenile under an appointment by the trial court.

[2] The cause was tried and the appeal lodged at a time when the decision of this court in State v. Green (State v. Coleman), Mo.,<cross_reference>470 S.W.2d 571</cross_reference>, was controlling.

[3] The judgment is reversed.
