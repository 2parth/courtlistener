<opinion_text>  The Commonwealth seeks a certification of the law concerning whether count one of an indictment against appellee states a violation of KRS <cross_reference>436.360</cross_reference>. Count one avers:

<block_quote>    "That during the year of 1965, in Jefferson County, Kentucky, the above named defendant conducted, managed, or promoted the business of Filter Queen of Louisville, Inc., a lottery or gift enterprise."</block_quote>

Upon an indictment in which the averment is indistinguishable from that herein presented the identical question was answered in Commonwealth v. Allen, Ky., <cross_reference>404 S.W.2d 464</cross_reference>. In that case we certified that such an averment in an indictment does properly state the offense denounced by KRS <cross_reference>436.360</cross_reference>. The former certification is dispositive of the instant query.

The law is so certified.
