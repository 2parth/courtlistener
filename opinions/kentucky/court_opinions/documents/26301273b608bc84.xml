Rhoda E. Pickrell's automobile was damaged by collision with another car. In this action against the New Amsterdam Casualty Company to recover on her policy<page_number>Page 355</page_number>
insuring her against such loss, defendant's demurrer to the petition was overruled, and having declined to plead further, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff. Defendant appeals.

The material provisions of the policy are as follows:

"New Amsterdam Casualty Company (a stock company) hereinafter called the Company

If canceled by the Company, the Company shall be entitled to the earned premium, pro rata. If canceled by the named Assured, the Company shall be entitled to the earned premium computed at short rates in accordance with the table printed hereon.

<block_quote>                "Statement 6: The liability of the Company, as respects each automobile covered hereby, shall be limited:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                "(a) Under Insuring Agreement (1) to Five Thousand  No/100 Dollars ($5000.00) for one person injured or killed, and, subject to that limit for each person, the Company's total liability on account of any one accident resulting in bodily injuries or death to more than one person shall be limited to Ten Thousand   No/100 Dollars ($10000.00).</block_quote>

<block_quote>                "(b) Under Insuring Agreement (2) to the actual value of the property damaged or destroyed at the time of such damage or destruction, which shall not be greater than actual cost of the repair or replacement thereof, and to loss sustained as a result of loss of use, but in no event in excess of the sum of One Thousand  No/100 Dollars ($1000.00) for any one accident resulting in damage or destruction or loss of use of such property, whether of one or more persons.</block_quote>

<block_quote>                "(c) Under Insuring Agreement (3), to the actual cash value of the property damaged or destroyed at the time of the collision or upset, or the cost of its suitable repair or replacement. The Company may pay the loss in money, or, at its option, by repair or replacement of the property damaged or destroyed. The Company shall have reasonable time and opportunity to examine any damaged automobile covered hereunder, before repairs are undertaken or physical evidence of the damage removed, but the Assured shall not be prejudiced<page_number>Page 360</page_number>
by any act on his part, or in his behalf undertaken, for the protection or salvage of any damaged automobile. The total loss resulting from one collision or upset shall be considered in the aggregate as constituting one claim and from the total amount (determined by agreement between the parties hereto, if possible, otherwise as provided in Condition I of this Policy), shall be deducted as co-insurance to be borne by the Assured, the sum of One Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($100.00)."</block_quote>

The petition admits that at the time of the collision the car was being driven by a boy under 16 years of age, but alleges that this was without plaintiff's knowledge or consent. It also alleges facts showing that the collision was the fault of the driver of the other car, and that the age of the boy driving her car had nothing to do with the accident.

The language of the policy is: "The New Amsterdam Casualty Company does hereby agree with the named Assured, subject to the limitations and conditions hereinafter provided, as respects bodily injuries or death suffered or alleged to have been suffered by any person or persons as the result of accident occurring in the continental limits of the United States and Canada while this policy is in force, by reason of the ownership, maintenance or use of any automobile described in the Schedule hereof, including the loading and unloading of any such automobile." The policy then insures against three things: (1) Injuries to others; (2) injuries to the property of others; (3) injuries to the car of the insured. Under the heading "Subject to the Following Conditions," we have Condition A, which, so far as material, reads as follows: "This policy does not cover: (1) any accident caused by any automobile while being used for or in any race or speed test; (2) while any automobile is being driven by any person in violation of law as to age, or under the age of sixteen years in any event."

The only question for consideration is whether clause 2 applies to damage to the car of the insured. Appellant's position is that the language of Condition A is broad and unequivocal, and plainly includes not only damage on account of bodily injuries to others, but damages to the car of the insured. In support of this position it argues that the words, "as respects bodily injuries or death suffered," do not modify or limit the words, "limitations and conditions hereinafter provided;" that<page_number>Page 361</page_number>
to so hold would confine all the limitations and conditions to bodily injuries or death suffered, when it is perfectly plain from the policy that the numerous conditions, such as the giving of notice of the accident, aiding in securing information, not voluntarily assuming any liability or incurring any expense, giving the right of subrogation, and limiting liability if the insured carries other insurance, apply alike to every kind of loss insured against. Were we to strike out the words, "limitations and conditions hereinafter provided," and thus make the policy read "does hereby agree with the named assured as respects bodily injuries or death suffered," etc., we would have an agreement confined solely to bodily injuries, when it is clear that other things were insured against. Were we to strike out the words, "as respects bodily injuries or death suffered," etc., we would be making a new contract for the parties. This we cannot do. We must construe the contract as written and give some effect to the language employed. The only meaning that can be given the words, "as respects bodily injuries and death suffered," etc., is that they modify in some way the words, "limitations and conditions hereinafter provided." In reaching this conclusion we do not mean to hold that all the limitations and conditions relate solely to cases of bodily injuries or death suffered. It may be that some of them apply to damage to the car of the insured, but in view of the restrictive language employed in the paragraph under consideration, and of the settled rule that a policy of insurance will be construed most strongly in favor of the insured, Insurance Co. of N. A. v. Cheathem, <cross_reference>221 Ky. 668</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>299 S.W. 545</cross_reference>; Niagara Ins. Co. of New York v. Jeffrey,<cross_reference>215 Ky. 644</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>286 S.W. 846</cross_reference>, we are of the opinion that none of them should be held to apply unless their language plainly requires such a construction.

It is evident that something has been omitted from clause 2 of Condition A. As written it does not make sense. To make sense we must combine clauses 1 and 2. When this is done the policy will read: "This Policy does not cover: (1) any accident caused by any automobile while being used for or in any race or speed test, or (2) any accident while any automobile is being driven by any person in violation of law as to age or under the age of sixteen (16) years in any event." There is nothing in this language that remotely suggests that it applies to damage to the car of the insured. On the contrary, it deals with accidents caused by any automobile while<page_number>Page 362</page_number>
being used in a race or driven in violation of law as to age, and not to accidents to the car of the insured. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that the remaining clauses provide in effect that the policy does not cover any automobile while being <italic>used</italic> for towing, or any automobile while being <italic>used</italic> for rental or livery purposes, etc., thus placing stress on the use of the automobile, and not on the fact that the accident was caused by the automobile. We are therefore constrained to the view that clauses 1 and 2 of Condition A do not apply to damages to the automobile of the insured. Having this view of the question, it follows that appellee's loss was covered by the policy. That being true, the court did not err in overruling the demurrer to the petition.

Judgment affirmed.

Whole court sitting.
