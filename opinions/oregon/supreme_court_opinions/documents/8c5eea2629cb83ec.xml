Miscellaneous Supreme Court disposition.

Chief petitioner Bill Sizemore's application to appear as<italic>amicus curiae</italic> with respect to the Attorney General's modified ballot title is treated as a motion to waive the limitations of ORAP 11.30(8) and, as so construed, it is granted. The objections of the Attorney General and petitioner Towers to the application to appear <italic>amicus curiae</italic> are overruled. The court has considered the merits of chief petitioner Sizemore's arguments and concludes that they are not well taken. The court certifies to the Secretary of State the Attorney General's modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 16 (2006). ORS <cross_reference>250.085</cross_reference>(10)(a).
