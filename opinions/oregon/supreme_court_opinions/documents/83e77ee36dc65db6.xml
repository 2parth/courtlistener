</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The questions raised on this appeal are entirely questions of fact which are discussed at some length in the briefs of both parties; but there is no bill of exceptions and no transcript of testimony, and, in that condition of the record, the findings of the Circuit Court are conclusive upon these questions and the judgment is affirmed.

AFFIRMED. REHEARING DENIED.
