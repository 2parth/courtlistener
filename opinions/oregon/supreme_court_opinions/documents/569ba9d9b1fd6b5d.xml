</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    In this proceeding on appeal from the Oregon Tax Court, plaintiff sought to challenge both the legal permissibility and the accuracy of a $40 "capital charge" that was levied against certain of his real property by Water Wonderland Improvement District, a public nonprofit corporation. ORS <cross_reference>554.130</cross_reference>. The Tax Court dismissed that portion of the proceeding on the ground that the capital charge was not a "tax" and, therefore, the Tax Court did not have jurisdiction under either of its jurisdictional statutes, ORS <cross_reference>305.410</cross_reference> (1) (Tax Court is "sole, exclusive and final judicial authority for the hearing and determination of all questions of law and fact arising under the tax laws") or <italic>former</italic> ORS <cross_reference>305.115</cross_reference> (4) (Tax Court has jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of Department of Revenue "arising * * * under the tax laws").<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

Plaintiff appeals the ruling of the Tax Court. We have considered plaintiff's arguments, but conclude that the Tax Court's ruling was correct.

The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> <italic>Former</italic> ORS <cross_reference>305.115</cross_reference> was repealed by Oregon Laws 1995, chapter 650, section 114.</footnote_body><page_number>Page 530</page_number>
