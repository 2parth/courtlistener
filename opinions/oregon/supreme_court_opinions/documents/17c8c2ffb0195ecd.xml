</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  In this ballot title review proceeding, petitioner challenges various aspects of the Attorney General's certified ballot title for a proposed initiative measure, which the Secretary of State has denominated as Initiative Petition 126 (2002). We review the Attorney General's certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS <cross_reference>250.035</cross_reference>(2)(a) to (d). <italic>See</italic> ORS <cross_reference>250.085</cross_reference>(5) (setting out standard of review).

We have considered petitioner's arguments and determine that they are not well taken. Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for the proposed measure:
