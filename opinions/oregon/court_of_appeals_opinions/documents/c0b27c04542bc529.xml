</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Appellant in this mental commitment case appeals a judgment committing him to the Mental Health Division for treatment for a period of time not to exceed 180 days. ORS <cross_reference>426.130</cross_reference>. The trial court found that appellant suffers from a mental disorder and is a danger to himself and others. The state concedes that the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that appellant's mental disorder causes him to be either a danger to himself or to others. On <italic>de novo</italic> review, we find the state's concession to be well founded and accept it.
