<opinion_byline>  <bold>PER CURIAM</bold>

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Plaintiffs brought this action against defendants Eckelman and Parmalee for a judicial declaration of their equitable interest in real property retained by them when they sold the property to the Eckelmans, their daughter and son-in-law. The continuing validity of that interest came into question when the Eckelmans defaulted on their mortgage to the Oregon Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA), which foreclosed and purchased the property. The Parmalees redeemed the property from DVA after purchasing the Eckelmans' statutory right of redemption.

The Eckelmans appeared in this action by filing a motion to dismiss them as parties. The motion was granted and judgment<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> was entered dismissing them on February 25, 1985. Thereafter, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was granted. On April 2, 1985, a final judgment<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> was entered for plaintiffs against the Parmalees and, on April 25, 1985, the Parmalees' motion for a new trial was denied. Notice of appeal was filed on May 23, 1985. It was not served on the Eckelmans.

At the time the notice of appeal was filed, failure to serve the notice on all parties who had appeared in an action, ORS <cross_reference>19.023</cross_reference>(2)(a),<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> was jurisdictional. <italic>Former</italic> ORS <cross_reference>19.033</cross_reference> (2).<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>
Dismissal of the appeal is required.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> <italic>Jacobson v. Mt. Park</italic><page_number>Page 662</page_number><italic>Home Owners Assn.,</italic> <cross_reference>65 Or. App. 269</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>670 P.2d 633</cross_reference> (1983), <italic>rev den</italic><cross_reference>296 Or. 253</cross_reference> (1984).

Appeal dismissed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> That judgment was not final. ORCP 67B.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The judgment against the Parmalees did not mention the dismissal of the Eckelmans but, because it complied with ORCP 67B, it was final.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> ORS <cross_reference>19.023</cross_reference> provides, in part:

<block_quote>    "(2) The appeal shall be taken by causing a notice of appeal, in the form prescribed by ORS <cross_reference>19.029</cross_reference>, to be served:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    "(a) On all parties who have appeared in the action, suit or proceeding."</footnote_body></block_quote>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> <italic>Former</italic> ORS <cross_reference>19.033</cross_reference> (2) provided:

<block_quote>    "The serving and filing of the notice of appeal as provided in ORS <cross_reference>19.023</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>19.026</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>19.029</cross_reference> is jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended."</footnote_body></block_quote>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> ORS <cross_reference>19.033</cross_reference>(2)(a) (<italic>amended by</italic> Or Laws 1985, ch 734, ยง 5, which became effective September 20, 1985) provides:

<block_quote>    "(2) The following requirements of ORS, 19.023, 19.026 and 19.029 are jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    "(a) Service of the notice of appeal on all parties identified in the notice of appeal as adverse parties or, if the notice of appeal does not identify adverse parties, on all parties who have appeared in the action, suit or proceeding, as provided in ORS <cross_reference>19.023</cross_reference> (2) (a), within the time limits prescribed by ORS <cross_reference>19.026</cross_reference>."</block_quote>

Because the notice of appeal identified only the Rhodes as adverse parties, we would have jurisdiction if the 1985 amendment applied here. It cannot be applied retroactively because this court did not acquire <italic>any</italic> jurisdiction under the notice of appeal that was filed.</footnote_body><page_number>Page 663</page_number>
