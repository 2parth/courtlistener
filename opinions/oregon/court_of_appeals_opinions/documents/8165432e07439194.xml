</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    Defendant appeals from a conviction for contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor. ORS <cross_reference>163.435</cross_reference>. She argues that the trial court erred by failing to specify in its sentence the amount of restitution that she would be required to pay as a condition of her probation. She concedes that she did not make an objection in the trial court, pursuant to ORS <cross_reference>137.106</cross_reference> (3). Her failure to object was a waiver of her rights under that statute. <italic>See State v. Carpenter,</italic> <cross_reference>101 Or. App. 489</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>791 P.2d 145</cross_reference>
(1990).

We do not address defendant's other assignment of error, because it lacks merit.
