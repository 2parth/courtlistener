<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Defendant appeals from a judgment finding him in violation of and revoking his probation for manufacturing a controlled substance. ORS<cross_reference>475.992</cross_reference>(1)(a). Defendant argues, <italic>inter alia</italic>, that the trial court erred in failing to advise him adequately of the risks and consequences of proceeding <italic>pro se</italic> at the probation violation hearing. The state confesses error in that regard, and we determine that concession is well-founded.<italic>See State v.
