<opinion_byline>  <bold>PER CURIAM</bold>

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Claimant seeks review of an order of the Workers' Compensation Board that affirmed and adopted the referee's order that upheld SAIF's denial of medical benefits. Claimant argues, and SAIF concedes, that the referee relied on certain medical reports that were not admitted in evidence. Because the referee's findings and conclusions, adopted by the Board, are not based on evidence in the record, we reverse and remand for reconsideration.
