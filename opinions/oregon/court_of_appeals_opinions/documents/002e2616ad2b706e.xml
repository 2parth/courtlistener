<opinion_text>  Plaintiffs, trustees of two pension and profit sharing trusts, brought this action, alleging that defendants had unlawfully offered and sold securities to the trusts in violation of ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(1)(b) and ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(3).<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The trial court gave a summary judgment in favor of defendant McLeod, and plaintiffs appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The issue is whether McLeod sustained his burden of showing that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to him and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we conclude that issues of fact were raised by the pleadings. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.

Defendants Labbe, Holtmann and McLeod were directors of Imperial Furniture Corporation. Labbe and<page_number>Page 148</page_number>
Holtmann were officers and employes of Imperial and drew monthly salaries. McLeod was neither an officer nor an employe. He did not participate in the day-to-day operations of the corporation. During 1978 and 1979, he regularly attended meetings of the board of directors. He relied on Labbe and Holtmann, as well as on Bogumil, Imperial's accountant, to give him accurate information about Imperial's day-to-day operations and its financial status. Late in 1978, McLeod advised Labbe and Holtmann that he wished to redeem his Imperial stock. This request was under consideration at the time of the sale of stock to the trusts. At that time, McLeod generally was aware that the other defendants were interested in raising capital for Imperial by selling stock. He was also aware that there were prospective buyers for the stock. He did not meet or speak with plaintiffs prior to the sale, nor did he involve himself directly with the sale of the stock because, as a stock broker, he feared a potential conflict of interest would be involved in his raising money for Imperial.

An attorney prepared a prospectus, disclosure letter and subscription agreement based on information provided by Holtmann, Labbe and Bogumil. McLeod did not participate in the preparation of those documents, believing that he could rely on the information, opinions, reports and statements of Labbe, Holtmann and Bogumil. He had been associated with them for years and had no reason to doubt their reliability or competency.

The prospectus and other documents were reviewed by plaintiffs' attorney, who advised them against purchasing the stock. The prospectus was also delivered to plaintiffs. Bogumil's recollection was unclear as to whether he actually went over the prospectus with them. Plaintiff Everts acknowledged reading the prospectus and accompanying financial statements. He also discussed the purchase with Bogumil and plaintiffs' attorney, but he made no independent investigation of Imperial, the market or the furniture industry in general. Everts did not consider himself a sophisticated investor.

The prospectus stated <italic>inter alia</italic> that Imperial was involved in a highly competitive business and that its success, if any, would be directly affected by its ability to compete in the marketplace. It disclosed that "many of [Imperial's] competitors have far greater resources and expertise than does the Company" and that "the Company can make no assurances<page_number>Page 149</page_number>
that its past financial history as evidenced by the attached financial statement will continue in the future." Under a heading entitled "Risk Factors," it warned:

<block_quote>    "Purchase of the Company's preferred stock is a speculative investment and should be contemplated only if the investor is economically sophisticated and able to bear the risk of loss of the entire investment. This investment in the company is not suitable for anyone whose net worth is less than $100,000 excluding home, home furnishings and automobiles, or who may require immediate cash repayment or distributions from his investment."</block_quote>

The prospectus invited potential purchasers to contact either Labbe or Holtmann to review the company records.

Under a heading entitled "Conflict of Interest" the prospectus disclosed that Labbe and Holtmann were officers and shareholders in the Brass Shop, Inc., and The Family Room, Inc. It stated that Imperial had engaged in financial transactions with both of those corporations and that those transactions were beneficial to Labbe and Holtmann. It stated that "there are no assurances made that the company's business relationships with the Brass Shop, Inc., and The Family Room, Inc., will be of benefit to the Company or its stockholders, other than Messrs. Labbe and Holtmann." It further disclosed that McLeod was desirous of redeeming his Imperial stock and that a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the new stock might be used for that purpose. It revealed that "there can be no assurance that additional financing needed could be obtained by the Company, if at all, on terms acceptable to the Company." The disclosure letter that was signed by Holtmann and Labbe stated:

<block_quote>    "* * * The company stock offered herein, must be considered an illiquid investment in that there is no ready market available for the sale of the stock. The preferred stock offered herein must be considered A HIGH RISK INVESTMENT APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WHOSE NET WORTH EXCEEDS $100,000 EXCLUDING PERSONAL RESIDENCE.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    "Again, we urge your independent investigation prior to signing the enclosed subscription agreement."</block_quote>

Finally, the subscription agreement asked that any purchaser warrant that he had read the disclosure letter and that he "has the knowledge and experience in financial and<page_number>Page 150</page_number>
business matters necessary to evaluate the merits and risks involved in the investment." The securities sold to the trusts were 600 newly issued shares of Imperial stock for a price of $60,000. After a disastrous year, during which Imperial's principal market collapsed, it was adjudicated a bankrupt. No distributions were made to any shareholder.

The only questions in this appeal are those dealing with plaintiffs' allegations that <italic>McLeod</italic> violated the Oregon Securities Law, specifically the vicarious liability statute, ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(3), in connection with the offer and sale of Imperial stock. In their complaint plaintiffs alleged that Imperial, and thus McLeod, failed to disclose that: (1) Imperial's inventory was less than shown in its financial statements, (2) its true financial condition was not as represented in its financial statements, (3) it had delinquent accounts receivable, (4) it was seeking to borrow substantial amounts of money, and (5) it had no purchasers for the remaining $240,000 worth of stock it had supposedly offered for sale. Plaintiffs further alleged that Labbe and Holtmann, and thus McLeod under ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(3), affirmatively misrepresented that: (1) the market for mobile homes, particularly in Alaska, was strong, whereas actually it was depressed, (2) Imperial would obtain a reasonable profit from the sale of merchandise to two other corporations, whereas the sales were at a loss, and (3) stock in other corporations owned by Labbe and Holtmann had been paid for by them personally, whereas payment in fact had been made by Imperial.

McLeod admitted that he was a director of Imperial at the time the securities were offered and sold, but he denied violating the Oregon Securities Law. Specifically, he denied that any of the alleged omissions or disclosures were<italic>material.</italic> He also denied that he knew or reasonably could have known that the alleged omissions or disclosures were misleading.

The trial court found that (1) the alleged omissions were not material and (2) that McLeod did not know and could not reasonably have known that the alleged omissions or representations were misleading. The question is whether the trial court properly could rule as a matter of law that the omissions or representations were not material, and, if the court could not do so, whether it could rule as a matter of law that<page_number>Page 151</page_number>
McLeod did not know or could not reasonably have known that the alleged omissions or representations were misleading.

In 1967, the Oregon Securities Law was amended to add ORS<cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(1)(b), which adopted substantially the language in the federal Securities Act of 1933, <cross_reference>15 U.S.C. § 77</cross_reference>(1) and (2). Accordingly, decisions construing the provisions of that Act are aids in interpreting and applying Oregon law. <italic>Karsun v.</italic><italic>Kelley,</italic> <cross_reference>258 Or. 155</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>161</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>482 P.2d 533</cross_reference> (1971). In determining materiality in the context of a proxy solicitation case, the Supreme Court adopted the following test of the materiality of an omission:

<block_quote>    "* * * An omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote. * * *" <italic>TSC Industries, Inc.</italic> <italic>v. Northway, Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>426 U.S. 438</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>449</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>96 S Ct 2126</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>48 L Ed 2d 757</cross_reference> (1976).</block_quote>

This standard has been followed by other federal courts in cases involving the federal counterpart to ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>.<italic>Spatz v. Borenstein,</italic> <cross_reference>513 F. Supp. 571</cross_reference> (ED Ill 1981); <italic>Alton Box</italic><italic>Bd. Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>560 F.2d 916</cross_reference> (8th Cir 1977).

The Supreme Court has also noted that a determination of materiality on summary judgment presents special problems:

<block_quote>    "The issue of materiality may be characterized as a mixed question of law and fact, involving as it does the application of a legal standard to a particular set of facts. In considering whether summary judgment on the issue is appropriate, we must bear in mind that the underlying objective facts, which will often be free from dispute, are merely the starting point for the ultimate determination of materiality. The determination requires delicate assessments of the inferences a 'reasonable shareholder' would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him, and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact. Only if the established omissions are 'so obviously important to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality' is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriately resolved 'as a matter of law' by summary judgment.  <italic>Johns Hopkins University v. Hutton,</italic> <cross_reference>422 F.2d 1124</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>1129</cross_reference> (CA4 1970). See <italic>Smallwood v. Pearl Brewing</italic> <italic>Co.,</italic> 489 F.2d, at 604; <italic>Rogen v. Ilikon Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>361 F.2d 260</cross_reference>, 265-267 (CA1 1966)." (Footnotes omitted.)  <italic>TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., supra,</italic>
426 US at 450.</block_quote><page_number>Page 152</page_number>

Because the question here is whether the omissions were material as a matter of law, we consider the converse of the Supreme Court's analysis, <italic>i.e.,</italic> whether the alleged omissions were so obviously <italic>unfCF9important that reasonable minds could</italic><italic>not differ on their materiality.</italic>

McLeod first argues that a reasonable investor could not consider the alleged omissions and misrepresentations material in light of the " 'total mix' of information made available."<italic>See TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., supra,</italic><cross_reference>426 US at 450</cross_reference>. He argues that plaintiffs were warned of the high risk of the investment, potential conflicts between Imperial and its management and Imperial's uncertain prospects for obtaining additional financing. He notes that the documents given plaintiffs cautioned that the proposed investment was "appropriate only for a sophisticated investor whose net worth exceeds $100,000 excluding personal residence" and that it urged potential investors' individual investigation. We conclude that those disclaimers are insufficient to control the materiality of omissions and misrepresentations. ORS<cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(1)(b) mandates a <italic>full and truthful</italic> disclosure of<italic>material</italic> information. <italic>See Spatz v. Borenstein, supra,</italic><cross_reference>513 F Supp at 580</cross_reference>; <italic>Sanders v. John Nuveen  Co., Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>619 F.2d 1222</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>1229</cross_reference> (7th Cir 1980). The mere fact that plaintiffs were urged to inquire further does not vitiate a legal liability flowing from a failure to disclose material information. <italic>Spatz v.</italic><italic>Borenstein, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>513 F Supp at 580</cross_reference>.

McLeod next contends that, in the light of the information given plaintiffs, they could not have reasonably relied on any omissions and misrepresentations. However, ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(1)(b) imposes liability without regard to whether the buyer relies on the omission or misrepresentation. <italic>See Sanders v. John Nuveen </italic><italic>Co., Inc., supra,</italic> 619 F.2d at 1225 (construing the federal Securities Act of 1933).

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, <italic>see Stanfield v. Laccoarce,</italic> <cross_reference>288 Or. 659</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>665</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>607 P.2d 177</cross_reference> (1980), we cannot conclude as a matter of law that no reasonable investor could consider the alleged omissions and misrepresentations <italic>un</italic>important. We do not hold that the question of the materiality of omissions or misrepresentations in connection with the sale of securities may never be decided on summary judgment. In the final analysis, materiality remains an objective question that can be answered as a matter of law<page_number>Page 153</page_number>
only when reasonable persons could not differ as to the importance of the omissions or misrepresentations.<italic>Securities and Exchange Com'n v. Savoy Industries,</italic> <cross_reference>587 F.2d 1149</cross_reference>
(DC Cir 1978), <italic>cert den sub nom Zimmerman v. Securities and</italic><italic>Exchange Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>440 U.S. 913</cross_reference> (1979), <italic>appeal after remand</italic><cross_reference>665 F.2d 1310</cross_reference> (DC Cir 1981).

We must consider next whether, as a matter of law, McLeod knew or reasonably could have known of the alleged omissions or misrepresentations. If he did not and could not, he would be excluded from liability, ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>(1)(b), and summary judgment for him would be proper.

In his affidavit, McLeod stated that: (1) he is a non-participating party to the violation, and nothing put him on notice of irregularities he was bound to investigate; (2) as an inactive director, he relied on statements made by active officers and directors of the corporation whose honesty he had no reason to doubt and on information provided by accountants and other professionals retained by Imperial whose competence he had no reason to doubt; and (3) ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference> should not impose on a director a higher standard of care than is imposed by ORS<cross_reference>57.228</cross_reference><footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> and 57.231<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> governing a directors' liability <italic>to a</italic><italic>corporation.</italic><page_number>Page 154</page_number>

There is little authority on the standard of care that an "outside" director must exercise to immunize himself from<page_number>Page 155</page_number>
liability resulting from omissions or misrepresentations made by officers or "inside" directors of a corporation in the offering and sale of corporate securities. The Seventh Circuit has held that what constitutes reasonable care under the federal act depends on the facts in each case. It declined to impose a strict standard of "reasonable investigation" on every seller covered by the statute. <italic>Sanders v. John Nuveen  Co.</italic><italic>Inc., supra,</italic> 619 F.2d at 1228. Another federal court has suggested that Congress intended to impose liability if the seller failed "to prove that he exercised reasonable care in investigating the truth of a representation." It held the seller liable by reason of his failure to prove that he "could not have known with the exercise of reasonable diligence" that he had made material omissions and misstatements. <italic>Johns Hopkins</italic><italic>University v. Hutton,</italic> <cross_reference>297 F. Supp. 1165</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1219-20</cross_reference> (D Md 1968).

Plaintiffs contend that McLeod was bound to inquire as to the truth and completeness of the offering documents. They rely on <italic>Gardner v. Donovan,</italic> <cross_reference>47 Or. App. 97</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>613 P.2d 1097</cross_reference> (1980). There we allowed summary judgment for the plaintiff in an ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference>
action where the defendant had failed to show facts that could prove that he could not have discovered the facts underlying the violation by reasonable inquiry. <italic>Gardner v. Donovan, supra,</italic><cross_reference>47 Or App at 102</cross_reference>. By our language in <italic>Gardner</italic> we did not intend to impose a duty of inquiry on every director. Rather, we adopt the reasoning in <italic>Sanders</italic> that whether a specific inquiry must be made depends on the facts in each case. Without evidence as to what a reasonable director would have done under these or similar circumstances, we cannot say whether McLeod needed to make further inquiry to immunize himself from potential liability.

We conclude that McLeod's statement in his affidavit that he relied on information received from Imperial's accountant and active officers and directors is insufficient to immunize him as a matter of law. He borrowed that standard from ORS<cross_reference>57.231</cross_reference>(3). Under certain circumstances that statute excludes directors from liability <italic>to a corporation</italic> for assenting<page_number>Page 156</page_number>
to distribution of dividends and assets of the corporation in excess of its legal and actual ability to do so. A director is excluded if he acts in good faith and relies on financial statements provided him by officers of the corporation or its accountant. ORS <cross_reference>57.231</cross_reference>(3) seeks to ensure the solvency of a corporation. ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference> provides a remedy for fraud in the sale of securities. The two statutes address different problems and, in the absence of evidence of legislative intent to impose on a director the same standard of care, we will not read into the clear language of ORS <cross_reference>59.115</cross_reference> the standard found in ORS <cross_reference>57.228</cross_reference>
and ORS <cross_reference>57.231</cross_reference>.

McLeod contends finally that, as an "outside" director without notice of any suspicious activity, he should not be held liable for the acts of active officers and directors. Those factors go into the mix of facts to be presented to the trier of fact to determine what constitutes reasonable care here, but they do not, as a matter of law, support summary judgment for McLeod.

Reversed and remanded.
