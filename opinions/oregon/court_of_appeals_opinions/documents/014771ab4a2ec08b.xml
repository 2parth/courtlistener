<opinion_byline>  <bold>PER CURIAM</bold>

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Wife appeals a decree of dissolution, challenging several of its provisions. On <italic>de novo</italic> review we affirm the decree with the exception of paragraph 7, which provides:

<block_quote>    "Petitioner [husband] shall have a judgment against Respondent [wife] for delinquent mortgage payments in the sum of $1,135.00."</block_quote>

Husband concedes that the proper amount of the judgment is $900.

Paragraph 7 of the decree is modified by reduction of the judgment to $900; otherwise the decree is affirmed. No costs to either party.<page_number>Page 187</page_number>
