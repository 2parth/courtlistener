</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    In this DUII case, defendant contends that he should have been permitted to assert as a defense that he was involuntarily intoxicated. In <italic>State v. Maguire,</italic> <cross_reference>78 Or. App. 459</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>717 P.2d 226</cross_reference>
(1986), we held that driving under the influence of intoxicants, <italic>former</italic> ORS <cross_reference>487.540</cross_reference>,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> is a strict liability crime and does not require a culpable mental state. On review, the Supreme Court, by an equally divided court, affirmed without opinion. <cross_reference>303 Or. 368</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>736 P.2d 193</cross_reference> (1987).

We affirm, relying on our reasoning in <italic>State v. Maguire,</italic><italic>supra.</italic>

Affirmed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The present statute, ORS <cross_reference>813.010</cross_reference>, applicable to this case, does not differ from the former statute in any respect material to this case.</footnote_body><page_number>Page 388</page_number>
