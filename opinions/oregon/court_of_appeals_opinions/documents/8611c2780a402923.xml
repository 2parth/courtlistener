</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The trial judge's ruling in this criminal case that a police officer's request to see defendant's driver's license, after the officer had pulled in behind defendant's apparently-disabled vehicle, was an impermissible "stop" of defendant is incorrect, as is the court's order suppressing evidence based upon that conclusion. <italic>See State v. Kennedy,</italic><cross_reference>290 Or. 493</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>497</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>624 P.2d 99</cross_reference> (1981).

The trial court order suppressing evidence is reversed, and the case is remanded for trial.<page_number>Page 470</page_number>
