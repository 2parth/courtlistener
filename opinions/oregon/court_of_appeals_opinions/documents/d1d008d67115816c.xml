<opinion_byline>  <bold>PER CURIAM</bold>

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Petitioner pled no contest to charges of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and delivery of a controlled substance. ORS<cross_reference>164.135</cross_reference>; ORS <cross_reference>475.992</cross_reference>(1). His convictions became final on July 21, 1989. On August 5, 1989, an amendment adding a 120-day limitation to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act became effective.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Nearly a year later, on July, 26, 1990, petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief. He filed an amended petition on August 24, 1990. It was dismissed on the ground that it was untimely. He asserts that the new limitation may not be applied to him, because his conviction became final before its effective date.

In <italic>Boone v. Wright,</italic> <cross_reference>110 Or. App. 281</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>822 P.2d 719</cross_reference> (1991), we concluded that the legislature intended the new limitation to apply to convictions entered in the register before its effective date. Petitioner had 120 days after the amendment's effective date to file a post-conviction petition.<cross_reference>110 Or App at 287</cross_reference>. He failed to file his petition within that time. Accordingly, it was untimely.

We decline to address petitioner's constitutional arguments, because he raises them for the first time on appeal. <italic>Cooper v.</italic><italic>Eugene Sch. Dist. No. 4J,</italic> <cross_reference>301 Or. 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>369</cross_reference> n 12, <cross_reference>723 P.2d 298</cross_reference>
(1986); <italic>Morrow v. Maass,</italic> <cross_reference>109 Or. App. 694</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>820 P.2d 1374</cross_reference> (1991).

Affirmed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Or Laws 1989, ch 1053, §§ 19, 22. ORS <cross_reference>138.510</cross_reference>(2) now provides, in part:

<block_quote>    "A petition pursuant to [the Post-Conviction Hearing Act] must be filed within 120 days of the following, unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    "(a) If no appeal is taken, the date the judgment or order on the conviction was entered in the register."</footnote_body></block_quote>
