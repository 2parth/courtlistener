<opinion_byline>  <bold>PER CURIAM</bold>

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Claimant seeks review of a Workers' Compensation Board order denying him compensation for his low back condition as either an aggravation or a new injury. We reverse and remand for reinstatement of respondent SAIF Corporation's acceptance of the claim.

The dispositive issue is whether SAIF is estopped from denying acceptance of the claim under <italic>Bauman v. SAIF,</italic> <cross_reference>295 Or. 788</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>670 P.2d 1027</cross_reference> (1983).<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> We hold that it is. SAIF concedes that, under <italic>Bauman,</italic> it is estopped from denying the<italic>compensability</italic> of the claim. SAIF argues, however, that <italic>Bauman</italic>
does not preclude its "back-up" denial of <italic>responsibility.</italic> That issue was decided against SAIF's position in <italic>Jeld-Wen, Inc. v.</italic><italic>McGehee,</italic> <cross_reference>72 Or. App. 12</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>695 P.2d 92</cross_reference> (1985), where we interpreted<italic>Bauman</italic> as applying to "back-up" denials of responsibility. SAIF's back-up denial of responsibility was issued after the 60-day time limit prescribed in ORS <cross_reference>656.262</cross_reference>(6). That denial is barred by <italic>Bauman. Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. McGehee, supra.</italic>

Reversed and remanded for reinstatement of respondent SAIF Corporation's acceptance of the claim.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> <italic>Bauman</italic> applies retroactively to back-up denials issued before<italic>Bauman</italic> was decided. <italic>U.S. National Bank v. Wagoner,</italic> <cross_reference>71 Or. App. 266</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>692 P.2d 149</cross_reference> (1984).</footnote_body><page_number>Page 424</page_number>
