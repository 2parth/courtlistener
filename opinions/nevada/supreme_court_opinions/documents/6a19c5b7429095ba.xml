This is a petition under SCR 114 to reciprocally discipline attorney Patrick G. Christoff, based on discipline imposed upon him in California. Christoff did not file a response to the petition.

Christoff made a brief California court appearance during a time in which he was fee suspended for failing to timely pay his California bar fees. Christoff and California bar counsel stipulated that this conduct violated California Business and Professions Code sections <cross_reference>6068</cross_reference>(a), <cross_reference>6125</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>6126</cross_reference>. Christoff failed to inform bar counsel of the discipline as required by SCR 114(1).

The California Supreme Court approved the parties' stipulation that Christoff be suspended from the practice of law in California for one year; that the suspension be stayed; and that Christoff be placed on two years' probation subject to numerous conditions. The conditions of probation include: compliance with the professional conduct rules; report of any changes of information within 10 days; meeting promptly with the probation deputy  responding truthfully to inquiries regarding compliance; submission of quarterly probation reports; successful completion of ethics school; completion of six hours of MCLE in law office management, attorney-client relations, and/or general legal ethics; passage of the MPRE; and payment of the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.

SCR 114(4) provides that this court shall impose identical reciprocal discipline unless the attorney demonstrates, or this court finds, that one of four exceptions applies. None of the exceptions is present in this case.

Accordingly, we grant the petition for reciprocal discipline. Attorney Patrick G. Christoff is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Nevada for one year.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> His suspension is stayed and he is<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
placed on probation for two years. Christoff is required to provide proof to Nevada bar counsel of compliance with the conditions of probation imposed upon him by California. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of probation and could subject Christoff to further discipline.

It is so ORDERED.

HARDESTY, C.J., PARRAGUIRRE, J., DOUGLAS, J., CHERRY, J., SAITTA, J., GIBBONS, J., PICKERING, J.
