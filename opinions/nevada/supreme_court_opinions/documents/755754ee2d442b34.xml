</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  In this appeal, we consider whether prejudgment interest should be calculated pursuant to a general interest statute, NRS <cross_reference>99.040</cross_reference>, or a specific interest statute, NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>, in a dissenting shareholder action that commenced before NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>
was enacted. We conclude that NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> applies.

<center>                                  <italic>FACTS</italic></center>
In 1987, respondents Unicoa Corporation shareholders Myron Chapman, Audrey Schlossberg, and Chapman Industries (collectively Chapman dissenters) dissented when Unicoa merged into appellant United Insurance Company of America (United). In 1987, the Chapman dissenters filed suit, seeking an appraisal and payment for their shares.<page_number>Page 747</page_number>

In 1995, before a final judgment was entered in this case, the Legislature enacted NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>, providing a specific interest rate to be applied in a dissenting shareholder action.

In 1996, the district court entered judgment for the Chapman dissenters regarding the stock's valuation, awarded attorney fees and costs to United based on a rejected offer of judgment, and denied the Chapman dissenters prejudgment interest. The parties appealed. This court affirmed the stock valuation, but vacated the district court order awarding attorney fees and costs because the offer of judgment was invalid.

On remand, the district court entered a final judgment for the Chapman dissenters, which calculated prejudgment interest pursuant to a general interest statute, NRS <cross_reference>99.040</cross_reference>. The final judgment states that the entire judgment, including principal and prejudgment interest, shall bear postjudgment interest. In the final judgment, the district court awarded attorney fees to the Chapman dissenters, based on NRS <cross_reference>18.010</cross_reference>(2)(b), finding that United's claim to calculate prejudgment interest pursuant to NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> was brought without reasonable ground. This appeal followed.

<center>                               <italic>DISCUSSION</italic></center>
United argues that the district court should have calculated prejudgment interest pursuant to the specific interest statute, NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>, <footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> rather than the general interest statute, NRS<cross_reference>99.040</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> Before NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> was enacted, <footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> prejudgment interest<page_number>Page 748</page_number>
in a dissenting shareholder action was calculated under NRS<cross_reference>99.040</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

United asks us to follow our 1984 decision in <italic>Bing</italic><italic>Construction v. Vasey-Scott Engineering</italic><footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> and conclude that NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> applies. We agree that <italic>Bing</italic> is controlling. In that case, a cause of action accrued prior to a statutory amendment that increased the applicable interest rate. This court concluded that the statutory rate in effect when the judgment was entered was the appropriate interest rate to apply.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>

Applying the general rule from <italic>Bing</italic>, we conclude that the statutory rate in effect when the 1996 final judgment was entered was the appropriate rate to use in calculating prejudgment interest. NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> was enacted before the final judgment was entered. The fact that this case involves a special interest statute is insufficient to deviate from our standard rule set forth in <italic>Bing.</italic> Therefore, we conclude that NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> applies and that the district court erred in calculating prejudgment interest pursuant to the general interest statute.

Next, United argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees pursuant to NRS<cross_reference>18.010</cross_reference>(2)(b). We agree.

NRS <cross_reference>18.010</cross_reference>(2)(b) provides, in pertinent part, that a district court may award attorney fees to a prevailing party when the court finds that a claim was brought without reasonable ground or to harass the prevailing party.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> A district court's award of attorney fees will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

Based on our conclusion that NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> applies, United's claim that prejudgment interest should be calculated pursuant to NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> was clearly brought with reasonable grounds. Therefore, the district court manifestly abused its discretion<page_number>Page 749</page_number>
in awarding attorney fees to the Chapman dissenters pursuant to NRS <cross_reference>18.010</cross_reference>(2)(b).<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference>

Finally, United argues that the district court erred in allowing the entire judgment, including prejudgment interest, to bear postjudgment interest. We agree.

This court has previously permitted an entire judgment, including prejudgment interest, to bear postjudgment interest.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> However, NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>, which controls the award of interest in this case, specifies that interest "must be computed from the effective date of the action until the date of payment." This statute provides for a single rate of interest from the effective date of the action to the date of payment, whenever that occurs, regardless of when a judgment is entered. Thus, our general holdings regarding postjudgment interest do not apply in light of the specific provisions of NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in allowing the entire judgment to bear postjudgment interest.

<center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
The statutory rate in effect when the final judgment was entered, set forth in NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>, was the appropriate rate to calculate interest. Additionally, the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees under NRS <cross_reference>18.010</cross_reference>(2)(b). Therefore, we reverse the portions of the judgment calculating interest pursuant to NRS <cross_reference>99.040</cross_reference> and awarding attorney fees, and we remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference>, providing the interest rate to be applied in dissenting shareholder actions, states:

<block_quote>  Interest payable pursuant to NRS <cross_reference>92A.300</cross_reference> to <cross_reference>92A.500</cross_reference>, inclusive, must be computed from the effective date of the action until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid by the entity on its principal bank loans or, if it has no bank loans, at a rate that is fair and equitable under all of the circumstances.</block_quote></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> NRS <cross_reference>99.040</cross_reference>(1) provides, in pertinent part:

<block_quote>  When there is no express contract in writing fixing a different rate of interest, interest must be allowed at a rate equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as ascertained by the commissioner of financial institutions, on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the date of the transaction, plus 2 percent, upon all money from the time it becomes due. . . .</block_quote></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> When the Legislature enacted NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> in 1995, it repealed an earlier statute, NRS 78.477 (adopted 1991), which provided a specific interest rate to be applied in a dissenting shareholder action. When this dissenting shareholder action was commenced in 1987, neither NRS <cross_reference>92A.340</cross_reference> nor its nearly identical predecessor, NRS 78.477 (adopted 1991), existed.</footnote_body>
