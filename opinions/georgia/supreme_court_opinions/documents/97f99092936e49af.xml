</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>The plaintiff in this action sought to enjoin the enforcement of a dispossessory warrant against her husband through which she would also be ousted. She also prayed for the appointment of a receiver and that she be decreed to be entitled to a one-half undivided interest in the property from which she was to be dispossessed. Her cause is predicated upon the allegation that a warranty deed which she and her husband executed to one Manget and which he transferred to one of the defendants in this case was actually only intended to secure a debt and was in effect a security deed. The plaintiff failed to make either Manget or her husband a party to the suit. The trial judge sustained demurrers pointing out this defect and dismissed the petition. <italic>Held:</italic>

Although the plaintiff did not pray for reformation of the warranty deed in question, the consequences of adjudging the instrument a mere deed to secure debt would be the same in<page_number>Page 303</page_number>
effect as a reformation of the deed. <italic>Hamilton v. Cargile</italic>,  <cross_reference>127 Ga. 762</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>766</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>56 S.E. 1022</cross_reference>). Since all persons having a legal or equitable interest in the subject matter of a suit must be made parties, "no court of equity should undertake to reform a written instrument conveying title to property, in an essential manner, without having before it all the parties to be affected by the proposed reformation." <italic>Wyche v. Green</italic>,  <cross_reference>32 Ga. 341</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>345</cross_reference>. The grantor and grantee of the deed were proper, necessary and indispensable parties, <italic>Volunteer State Life</italic> <italic>Ins. Co. v.
