Upon consideration of the Application for Certificate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas corpus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied.

<italic>All the Justices concur, except Carley and Hines, JJ., who</italic><italic>dissent.</italic>

</opinion_text><dissent_byline>     Carley, Justice, dissenting.

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>     I dissent from the denial of this habeas corpus matter on the merits because petitioner did not "file a written application for a certificate of probable cause to appeal with the Clerk of the Supreme Court within thirty days of the entry of the order denying him relief," as required by OCGA ยง <cross_reference>9-14-52</cross_reference>(b). Accordingly, I would dismiss.

I am authorized to state that Justice Thompson and Justice Hines join in this dissent.
