<opinion_byline>   HUNT, Presiding Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   Mark Steven Lamb was convicted of felony murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> He appeals. We affirm the judgment but remand for findings concerning his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

1. After reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the jury's determination of guilt, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of the offenses charged. <italic>Jackson v. Virginia</italic>, <cross_reference>443 U.S. 307</cross_reference>
(<cross_reference>99 S.C. 2781</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>61 L.Ed.2d 560</cross_reference>) (1979).

2. There was no fatal variance between the allegations of the indictment and the evidence presented at trial. See generally<italic>DePalma v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>225 Ga. 465</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>469</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>169 S.E.2d 801</cross_reference>) (1969).

3. Lamb's contention that a sequential homicide charge similar to that criticized in <italic>Edge v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>261 Ga. 865</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>414 S.E.2d 463</cross_reference>) (1992), amounted to reversible error is meritless because the evidence did not authorize consideration of voluntary manslaughter as a possible verdict.

4. The defendant claims that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel because of circumstances which resulted in a conflict of interest for his attorney. Because this claim is raised for the first time on appeal, we remand the case to the trial court for a hearing and appropriate findings concerning the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. <italic>Smith v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>255 Ga. 654</cross_reference> (3) (<cross_reference>341 S.E.2d 5</cross_reference>) (1986).

5. The defendant's remaining enumerations of error are without merit.
