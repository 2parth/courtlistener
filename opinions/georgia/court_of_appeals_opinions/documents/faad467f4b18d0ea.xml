<opinion_byline>   BEASLEY, Judge.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   Defendant's notice of appeal, taken from a judgment entered on October 20, 1987, was filed on December 9. This of course, was not timely, OCGA ยง <cross_reference>5-6-38</cross_reference> (a). Upon filing, defendant contended below that he did not learn of the judgment until December 4, 1987, and requested permission to appeal out of time.

Under OCGA ยง <cross_reference>15-6-21</cross_reference> (c) the trial court was required to notify the attorney of the losing party of its decision on the motion. Pro se defendant should have been notified. If he was not, the failure would not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal. <italic>Robinson v. Kemp Motor Sales,</italic> <cross_reference>185 Ga. App. 492</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>493</cross_reference>
(<cross_reference>364 S.E.2d 623</cross_reference>) (1988). However, it could furnish a basis for the grant of an out-of-time appeal in that he was deprived of his right to appeal, which is of constitutional dimensions. <italic>Mobley</italic><italic>v.

App. 197</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>197</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>366 S.E.2d 778</cross_reference>) (1978), approved by the Supreme Court in its order in <italic>Willis v. State</italic> (case no. 45592, issued Oct. 19, 1988).

The issue is whether defendant received notice and delayed taking action, in which case he has forfeited his right to appeal, or whether there was no timely notice, in which case either the judgment should be set aside and a new judgment entered from which a timely<page_number>Page 532</page_number>
appeal might be taken or an out-of-time appeal should be considered. See <italic>Cambron v. Canal Ins. Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>246 Ga. 147</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>148</cross_reference> (1) (<cross_reference>269 S.E.2d 426</cross_reference>) (1980). See also dissent in <italic>Crawford v. Kroger</italic><italic>Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>183 Ga. App. 836</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>837</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>360 S.E.2d 274</cross_reference>) (1987).

In any event, the docketing of the case in this Court is premature because the request for an out-of-time appeal has not been ruled upon by the trial court. The appeal is therefore dismissed and the case remanded for a determination whether defendant was notified as required under OCGA ยง <cross_reference>15-6-21</cross_reference> (c) and for such other action as deemed appropriate.
