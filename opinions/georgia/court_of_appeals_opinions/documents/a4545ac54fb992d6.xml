<opinion_byline>   WEBB, Judge.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   This is an attempted pro se appeal by a criminal defendant either from the same judgment appealed from and reviewed in<italic>Miller v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>144 Ga. App. 669</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>242 S.E.2d 330</cross_reference>) (1978), or perhaps from a later order of the trial court denying a motion to set that judgment aside. In neither event was the notice of appeal filed within 30 days of the entry of the order as required by Code Ann. § 6-803 (a), and accordingly this appeal must be dismissed. <italic>Smith v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>140 Ga. App. 492</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>231 S.E.2d 493</cross_reference>) (1976).

Even so, however, as heretofore ruled, there was ample evidence to support the verdict of guilty of the crime of burglary. <italic>Miller v. State,</italic> supra.

<italic>Appeal dismissed. Quillian, P. J., and McMurray, J., concur.</italic>
