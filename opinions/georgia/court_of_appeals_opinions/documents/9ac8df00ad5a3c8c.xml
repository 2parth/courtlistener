<opinion_text>1. An order sustaining certain special demurrers to the petition and limiting the action to one arising ex contractu, which left the suit pending in the lower court, was not a final judgment from which a direct bill of exceptions would lie.  <italic>Harrell</italic> v. <italic>Southern Ry. Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>13 Ga. App. 409</cross_reference>
(<cross_reference>79 S.E. 240</cross_reference>); <italic>Woodland</italic> v. <italic>Woodland,</italic> <cross_reference>33 Ga. App. 167</cross_reference>
(<cross_reference>125 S.E. 732</cross_reference>); <italic>Joyner</italic> v. <italic>Hamilton,</italic> <cross_reference>79 Ga. App. 106</cross_reference>
(<cross_reference>53 S.E.2d 133</cross_reference>); <italic>Fickett</italic> v. <italic>Fuller,</italic> <cross_reference>171 Ga. 190</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>154 S.E. 784</cross_reference>). The main bill of exceptions was, therefore prematurely sued out, and must be dismissed.

2. Where the cross-bill of exceptions was not tendered within twenty days from the date of the order complained of, even though such order would have been a final order had it been rendered as contended by the plaintiff in error in such cross-bill, but was tendered within the time allowed by law for cross-bills of exceptions, it came too late to be treated as a main bill of exceptions, and since the main bill of exceptions has been dismissed, the cross-bill must likewise be dismissed. <italic>Perdue</italic> v. <italic>Anderson,</italic> <cross_reference>137 Ga. 512</cross_reference> (2) (<cross_reference>73 S.E. 1050</cross_reference>).
