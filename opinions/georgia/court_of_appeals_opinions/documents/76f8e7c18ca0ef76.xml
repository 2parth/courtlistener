<opinion_byline>   BANKE, Chief Judge.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   The plaintiff brought this action against K-Mart Corporation and one of its store security guards, Wayne Smith, to recover damages arising from her arrest for shoplifting. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants, and the plaintiff filed this appeal, enumerating as error the trial court's failure to charge on slander. The slander is alleged to have occurred when Smith informed the plaintiff, in a back room of the store in the presence of the store manager, that he had seen her switch labels on certain merchandise. <italic>Held</italic>:

Assuming arguendo that the accusation made in the presence of the store manager was not privileged within the meaning of OCGA ยง<page_number>Page 727</page_number><cross_reference>51-5-7</cross_reference>, it has been held in similar situations that a statement made by an employee to an immediate supervisor in the course of his employment and concerning a matter directly related to the performance of his job does not constitute a publication sufficient to support an action for slander.
