<opinion_byline>   SHULMAN, Judge.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   Plaintiffs-landlord brought suit against defendant-tenant seeking a writ of possession and a money judgment for rent due and owing. No answer was filed by defendant and a default judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant subsequently filed a motion to set aside the judgment, alleging that the judgment was based<page_number>Page 554</page_number>
in part upon certain portions of the parties' rental agreement which were void as a matter of law. Defendant appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to set aside. We affirm.

1. "To set aside a judgment under Code Ann. § 81A-160 (d), the movant must show that the motion is `predicated upon some nonamendable defect which does appear upon the face of the record or pleadings,' and that `the pleadings ... affirmatively show that no claim in fact existed.' [Cit.]" <italic>Midland Guardian Co. v.</italic><italic>Varnadore,</italic> <cross_reference>148 Ga. App. 742</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>252 S.E.2d 685</cross_reference>).

There is nothing in the record of this case to show that the liquidated damages provision of the rental contract on its face was violative of Georgia law. See, e.g., <italic>Mayor c. of Washington</italic><italic>v. Potomac Eng. c. Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>132 Ga. 849</cross_reference> (<cross_reference>65 S.E. 80</cross_reference>).

Nor has appellant cited authority to support his contention that the late fees charged by appellees-landlord for the defendant's nonpayment of rent constituted usurious interest as a matter of law. Moreover, since appellant's contention that the late fee charges were a device to cover up usury raises a question of fact for jury resolution (see, e.g.,<italic>Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Provident c. Assur. Society,</italic><cross_reference>126 Ga. 50</cross_reference> (6) (<cross_reference>54 S.E. 929</cross_reference>)), the issue cannot be said to be a nonamendable defect which is not cured by judgment.

2. Similarly, the court's award of $200 in past due rental is not subject to a motion to set aside for the reason that the demand for such amount was in conflict with the plain terms of the lease agreement. Appellees were awarded $200 as additional rent due for August, 1977, in accordance with the agreement. In the rental agreement, appellant agreed to pay appellees $100 on April 1; May 1; June 1; and July 1; and $50 on August 1, for past due rental. Since $200 of these amounts remained outstanding on August 1, 1977, the court was authorized to award appellees the additional $200, properly due in August, 1977.

"Having failed to demonstrate the existence of a nonamendable defect on the face of the record, [appellant is] not entitled to have the judgment against [him] set aside." <italic>Midland Guardian</italic><italic>Co.,</italic> supra, (2).<page_number>Page 555</page_number>
 <italic>Judgment affirmed. Deen, C. J., and Carley, J., concur.</italic>
