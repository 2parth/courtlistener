<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On September 15, 2008, counsel for Chevy Chase Buick wrote a letter to the Clerk of this Court in which he noted that, while the dispositive issues below had been resolved, a motion for attorney's fees filed by Hyundai Motor Finance Co. remained pending in the trial court. Construing the letter as a motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction, we deny it. A judgment is final for purposes of appeal not-withstanding the pendency of a post-trial motion for attorney's fees. <italic>See</italic><italic>Pallie v.
