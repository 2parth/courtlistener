<opinion_text>[1]    Ramon and Richardo Navarro were originally charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of LSA-R.S. <cross_reference>40:967</cross_reference>. Following plea bargaining, the state reduced the charge to attempted possession of cocaine. Both Navarros then entered guilty pleas and were sentenced to two and one-half years at hard labor and ordered to pay $2,500.00 fines plus court costs, the statutory maximum.

[2]    On appeal, the Navarros contend the sentence was excessive and grossly disproportionate to the crime. Appellants are 45 and 38 years of age respectively, and they are first offenders!

[3]    At the sentencing hearing, the trial Judge said that ". . . these people (the defendants) are pushers of cocaine and a detriment to our community." Three ounces of cocaine and $2,473.00 in cash were seized when appellants were arrested.

[4] The trial judge noted that defense counsel had been instrumental in having the charge reduced. Possession with intent to distribute cocaine, the initial charge, carries a penalty of up to 30 years at hard labor and a fine of up to $15,000.00. It is proper for the sentencing judge to consider a plea bargain which results in a considerable reduction in prison exposure. See<italic>State v. Vinson,</italic> <cross_reference>482 So.2d 48</cross_reference> (La.App. 5th Cir. 1986), wherein the court said at page 53:

[5]    "It is well established that the trial judge is given wide discretion in the imposition of sentences within statutory limits. Absent a manifest abuse of that discretion, the sentence imposed by a trial judge should not be set aside as excessive.  <italic>State v. Lanclos,</italic> <cross_reference>419 So.2d 475</cross_reference>, 478 (La. 1982). Further, the jurisprudence holds that where a plea bargain results in a significantly reduced potential exposure, the maximum sentence under the crime pled to is not an abuse of the trial court's discretion. <italic>State v. Lanclos, supra;</italic> <italic>State v. McDowell,</italic> <cross_reference>457 So.2d 871</cross_reference> (La. App. 3d Cir. 1984); <italic>State v. Babcock,</italic> <cross_reference>461 So.2d 477</cross_reference> (La.App. 3d Cir. 1984).

[6]    "Although the sentence imposed was the maximum allowed for the crime to which the defendant pled guilty, by plea bargaining, the defendant obtained a significant reduction in the sentence he could have received. Consequently, we cannot say under these circumstances that the trial judge abused his discretion or that the sentence is excessive."

[7]    Although there was minimal compliance with LSA-C.Cr.P. art.<cross_reference>894.1</cross_reference>, a remand is unnecessary. Considering the nature and circumstances of the crime, original charge and the plea bargaining, the trial judge did not abuse the vast sentencing discretion he has.

[8]    Also, there are no errors patent. Although neither Navarro is very familiar with the English language, they were fully advised of their constitutional rights and the maximum penalty through a Spanish-speaking interpreter. The record clearly indicates that the rights were understood and effectively waived.

[9]    AFFIRMED.
