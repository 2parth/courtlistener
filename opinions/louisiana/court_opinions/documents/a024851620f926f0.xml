<posture>      IN RE: THE TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE LOUISIANA COCA-COLA BOTTLING COMPANY, LTD., APPLYING FOR CERTIORARI, OR WRIT OF REVIEW, TO THE COURT OF APPEAL, FOURTH CIRCUIT, PARISH OF PLAQUEMINES.

</posture>
<opinion_text>[1]    Writ refused. On the facts found by the Court of Appeal we find no error of law in its judgment.

</opinion_text>
<opinion_byline>[2]    HAWTHORNE, Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>[3]    I am of the view that a writ should be granted in this case solely and only because of the fact that this Court granted a writ in Pilie v. National Food Stores, Inc., La., <cross_reference>150 So.2d 586</cross_reference>, which case presents, in my view, the same legal question.
