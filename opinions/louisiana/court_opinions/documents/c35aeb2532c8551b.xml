<posture>      IN RE: FRANK HARVEY APPLYING FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.

</posture>
<opinion_text>[1]    Writ refused. The showing made is insufficient to warrant the exercise of our jurisdiction.

[2]    BARHAM, J., is of the opinion the writ should be granted. The trial court has denied defendant-relator a preliminary examination under his "discretion" which actually is a simple finding that a bill of information has been filed. If "discretion" is the standard for granting a preliminary examination, it is abused here. However, "discretion" may not be the standard. See Pugh v. Rainwater, 5 Cir. 1973, <cross_reference>483 F.2d 778</cross_reference>.

[3]    TATE, J., is of the opinion the writ should be granted.
