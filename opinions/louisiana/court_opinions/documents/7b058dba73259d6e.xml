<opinion_text><unpublished>  In this case, petitioner, an inmate in the custody of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections ("DPSC"), sought review of Administrative Remedy Procedure No. D.C.I.-2006-208, concerning his sentencing as a habitual offender. The petitioner alleged that the trial court failed to impose an enhanced sentence under the terms of La. R.S.<cross_reference>15:529.1</cross_reference> and that he should be deemed eligible to receive good time credits on his 15-year sentence pursuant to La. R.S. <cross_reference>15:571.3</cross_reference>. Following a <italic>de novo</italic> review of the record herein, including the traversal by petitioner and the Commissioner's Report, the trial court maintained the decision by DPSC, dismissing petitioner's suit with prejudice. This appeal followed. After a thorough review of the record and relevant jurisprudence, we find the cases of <bold>Canty v. Day</bold>, 99-0649, p. 3 (La.App. 1 Cir. 12/28/99), <cross_reference>756 So.2d 384</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>385-386</cross_reference> and <bold>Toliver v. Day</bold>, 99-1192, pp. 2-3 (La.App. 1 Cir. 12/28/99), <cross_reference>756 So.2d 386</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>387</cross_reference> to be controlling. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment in accordance with Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal, Rule 2-16.2A(2), (5), (6), and (8). All costs associated with this appeal are assessed against petitioner.
