<posture>      In re: Earl Howard Bolds applying for writ of review, certiorari, prohibition or rule nisi.

</posture>
<opinion_text>[1]    Writ refused. This case is appealable to the Court of Appeal. Article <cross_reference>7</cross_reference>, Section 29, Louisiana Constitution. See also State in Interest of Cook, La.App., <cross_reference>145 So.2d 627</cross_reference>. Hence, application must be made first to the Court of Appeal before invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court.
