<opinion_text>[1]    The issue in this case is identical with the one disposed of this day in State v. Bellande, 240 La. ___, <cross_reference>128 So.2d 14</cross_reference>, nevertheless we are without appellate jurisdiction<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> since no jail sentence was imposed by the court below and the fine actually imposed did not exceed $300.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> See State v. Shelton,<cross_reference>227 La. 27</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>78 So.2d 498</cross_reference>, and cases therein cited.

[2]    The appeal is dismissed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> La.Const. Art. 7, Sec. 10 provides: "* * * The following cases only shall be appealable to the Supreme Court; * * * (5) Criminal cases in which the penalty of death or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed, or in which a fine <italic>exceeding three hundred dollars</italic> or imprisonment exceeding six months has been actually imposed." (Emphasis supplied.)</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The defendant herein entered a plea of guilty as charged with violation of R.S. <cross_reference>56:497</cross_reference> [trawling in inside waters in closed season] and was sentenced to pay a fine of $200 and costs or to serve 15 days in the Parish jail. The court also ordered the trawl nets and other paraphernalia forfeited.</footnote_body>
