<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  ¶ 1 Petitioner has requested relief from this court in the form of an extraordinary writ. He has challenged an order by the trial court in the case of <italic>Ohio Casualty Insurance</italic><italic>Co. v. Young, Pontiac, Cadillac, GMC Truck Co.</italic> finding him in contempt of court and removing him as counsel in that case as a sanction. A contempt sanction is subject to an appeal in the case in chief. <italic>See, e.g., Utah Farm Prod. Credit Ass'n</italic><italic>v. Labrum</italic>, <cross_reference>762 P.2d 1070</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1074-75</cross_reference> (Utah 1988) (recognizing that every court has the power to compel obedience to its orders and, upon ordinary appellate review, upholding a contempt order issued by the trial court); <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Clark</italic>, <cross_reference>2005 UT 75</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>17</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>124 P.3d 235</cross_reference> (similarly upholding the trial court's finding of contempt). Therefore a legal remedy was available to petitioner. An extraordinary writ will not lie where a "plain, speedy and adequate remedy is available." Utah R. Civ. P. 65B(a). We therefore dismiss the Petition for Extraordinary Writ.
