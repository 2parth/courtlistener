<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                           MEMORANDUM DECISION</center></unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>  BENCH, Judge:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Plaintiff conceded below that her "state law claim concerns only [issues] from [her] termination date forward." Accordingly, we consider only those issues that involve facts on or after September 16, 1997, the date Plaintiff's employment was terminated.

The trial court granted summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's defamation and false light claims. "We review a grant of summary judgment for correctness, giving no deference to the trial court's legal determinations." <underline>Shattuck-Owen v. Snowbird Corp.</underline>, <cross_reference>2000 UT 94</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>9</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>16 P.3d 555</cross_reference>.

Plaintiff's defamation claims fail as a matter of law because the communications set forth by Plaintiff that were allegedly defamatory were all conditionally and/or absolutely privileged. <underline>See</underline> <underline>Price v. Armour</underline>,<cross_reference>949 P.2d 1251</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1256</cross_reference> (Utah 1997) ("An absolute privilege is granted to participants in judicial proceedings."); <underline>Dubois v. Grand Central</underline>,<cross_reference>872 P.2d 1073</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1079</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1994) (stating that a "`qualified privilege protects an employer's communication to employees and to other interested parties concerning the reasons for an employee's discharge'" (citation omitted)). Furthermore, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged facts to show that any such privilege was abused. <underline>See id.</underline>

In similar fashion, Plaintiff's false light claim fails because Plaintiff has not set forth facts to establish the necessary element of public disclosure. <underline>See</underline> <underline>Shattuck-Owen</underline>, <cross_reference>2000 UT 94</cross_reference> at ¶ <cross_reference>12</cross_reference> ("Public disclosure `means that the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge.'" (citation omitted)); <underline>see also</underline> <underline>Stien v. Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc.</underline>,<cross_reference>944 P.2d 374</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>380</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1997) (setting forth the elements of a false light claim, which include "`publicity [of] a matter concerning another that places the other <underline>before the public</underline> in a false light'" (citation omitted) (emphasis added)). After viewing "`the facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to [Plaintiff],'" we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Defendants. <underline>Shattuck-Owen</underline>, <cross_reference>2000 UT 94</cross_reference> at ¶ <cross_reference>9</cross_reference>
(citation omitted).

Finally, Plaintiff's procedural claims are without merit. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v.</underline><underline>Allen</underline>, <cross_reference>839 P.2d 291</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>303</cross_reference> (Utah 1992) (permitting appellate courts to decline to analyze and address in writing every issue raised).

We therefore affirm.

WE CONCUR: Judith M. Billings, Associate Presiding Judge, and Pamela T. Greenwood, Judge.
