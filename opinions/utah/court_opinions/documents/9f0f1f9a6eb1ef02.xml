<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  ¶ 1 Todd Stone seeks to appeal the January 7, 2011 and January 13, 2011 minute entries in his divorce proceeding. This matter is before the court on a sua sponte motion for summary disposition for lack of jurisdiction due to the absence of a final order. We dismiss the appeal without prejudice.

  ¶ 2 Generally, "[a]n appeal is improper if it is taken from an order or judgment that is not final." <italic>Bradbury v.</italic><italic>Valencia</italic>, <cross_reference>2000 UT 50</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>9</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>5 P.3d 649</cross_reference>. For an order or judgment to be final, it must "dispose of all parties or claims to an action." <italic>Id.</italic> ¶ 10. The only exceptions to the final judgment rule are where: (1) an appeal is permitted under the circumstances by statute, (2) the appellate court grants interlocutory appeal under rule 5 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure, or (3) the trial court certifies the order as final under rule 54(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. <italic>See id.</italic> ¶ 12.

  ¶ 3 The first minute entry that was entered on January 7, 2011, denies Stone's motion to discontinue child support. Because there is a pending petition to modify, encompassing these claims, the minute entry denying Stone's motion to discontinue child support is not a final, appealable order. The second minute entry entered on January 7, 2011, refers to a motion for order to show cause, filed on January 5, 2011. Stone requested a hearing on his motion. A final, appealable order has not been entered on the motion for order to show cause as the motion is set for a hearing. Thus, the minute entries which Stone seeks to appeal are not final, appealable orders, and this court is required to dismiss the appeal without prejudice.<italic>See Bradbury</italic>, <cross_reference>2000 UT 50</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>8</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>5 P.3d 649</cross_reference>.

  ¶ 4 Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without prejudice to the filing of a timely appeal from a final, appealable order. Appellee's request for attorney fees is denied.<page_number>Page 874</page_number>
