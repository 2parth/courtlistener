<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Daniel Staggs appeals his conviction on a charge of vehicle burglary. Staggs's counsel filed a brief pursuant to <underline>Anders v. California</underline>, 386 U.S. 783 (1967), and <underline>State v. Clayton</underline>, <cross_reference>639 P.2d 168</cross_reference> (Utah 1981). The brief "objectively demonstrate[s] that the issues raised are frivolous."<underline>State v. Flores</underline>, <cross_reference>855 P.2d 258</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>260</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1993) (per curiam). Based upon our independent examination of the record, we determine that the appeal is, indeed, wholly frivolous. Accordingly, we affirm Staggs's conviction and sentence and grant counsel's motion to withdraw.

Judith M. Billings, Judge, James Z. Davis, Judge, Carolyn B. McHugh, Judge.
