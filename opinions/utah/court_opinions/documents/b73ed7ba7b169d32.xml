<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Timothy D. Neville appeals the trial court's final order entered on December 7, 2007. This is before the court on its own motion for summary disposition.

Pursuant to rule 4(a) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure, a notice of appeal must be filed with the clerk of the trial court within thirty days after the entry of the judgment or the order appealed.<underline>See</underline> Utah R. App. P. 4(a). Under the rule, Neville's notice of appeal was required to be filed no later than January 7, 2008.

Neville's notice of appeal was filed in the trial court on January 8, 2008, more than thirty days after the entry of the order dismissing his case. Thus, Neville's notice of appeal is untimely. If an appeal is not timely filed, this court lacks<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
jurisdiction to consider the appeal and must dismiss it. <underline>See Serrato v.</underline><underline>Utah Transit Auth.</underline>, <cross_reference>2000 UT App 299</cross_reference>, Â¶ <cross_reference>7</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>13 P.3d 616</cross_reference>.

Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.

Pamela T. Greenwood, Presiding Judge, William A. Thorne Jr., Associate Presiding Judge, Judith M. Billings, Judge.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
