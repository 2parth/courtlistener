<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This case is before the court on Appellee Munro's motion to stay or dismiss the appeal because a motion to set aside the stipulation is still pending before the trial court. Appellant Huish has filed a response substantially concurring with the motion and requesting this court to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

The parties' stipulation formed the basis for the decree of paternity. On March 28, 2002, prior to the entry of that decree, Huish filed the motion to set aside the stipulation alleging that the court did not incorporate all matters to which the parties had stipulated into the decree of paternity. After a hearing, the trial court reserved ruling on the motion. Subsequently, the trial court entered a decree of paternity on July 8, 2002. Huish appealed from the decree of paternity, believing that it was the final order in the matter. Munro cross appealed. However, the parties now agree that the pending motion, as a motion under rule 52(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, tolls the time for appeal in this case. Therefore, this court does not have jurisdiction until the trial court rules on the pending motion. <underline>See</underline> Utah R.App.P. 4(c). Although the motion was filed prior to entry of the decree of paternity, it is still timely under the rule because it was "made not later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment." Utah R.Civ.P. 52(b). Until the trial court enters a ruling on this motion, this court is without jurisdiction over the appeal. <underline>See</underline> Utah R.App.P. 4(c).

Accordingly, we grant the motion, and dismiss the appeal. This dismissal is without prejudice to the filing of a new, timely notice of appeal after the trial court rules on the pending motion.

Judith M. Billings, Associate Presiding Judge, Russell W. Bench, Judge, and William A. Thorne Jr., Judge, concur.
