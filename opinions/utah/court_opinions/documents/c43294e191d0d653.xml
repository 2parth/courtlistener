<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                           MEMORANDUM DECISION</center></unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>  ORME, Judge:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  We have determined that "[t]he facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record[,] and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument." Utah R. App. P. 29(a)(3). Moreover, the issues presented are readily resolved under applicable law.

Absent a reply brief, the State's assertion that "the jury was never informed about the prior conviction enhancement or the existence of any prior convictions, and it was never exposed to the specific language in the information" stands unrefuted. Given that circumstance, we readily conclude that Defendant has failed to establish any prejudice resulting from the reference in the information to a prior conviction. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v. Ellifritz</underline>,<cross_reference>835 P.2d 170</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>174</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1992).

Affirmed.

WE CONCUR: Norman H. Jackson, Judge and William A. Thorne Jr., Judge.
