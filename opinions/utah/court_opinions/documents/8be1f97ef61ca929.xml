<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Mary Jean Johnson appeals her sentences entered on March 19, 2007. Johnson asserts that the district court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences without considering the statutory factors set forth in Utah Code section <cross_reference>76-3-401</cross_reference> and by ordering consecutive prison sentences in lieu of probation. We affirm.

This court reviews the sentencing decision of the district court, including the decision to grant or deny probation, for an abuse of discretion. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v. Valdovinos</underline>, <cross_reference>2003 UT App 432</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>14</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>82 P.3d 1167</cross_reference>. "An abuse of discretion results when the judge fails to consider all legally relevant factors, or if the sentence imposed is clearly excessive." <underline>Id.</underline> Furthermore, a "defendant is not entitled to probation, but rather the court is empowered to place the defendant on probation if it thinks that will best serve the ends of justice and is compatible with the public interest." <underline>State v. Rhodes</underline>, <cross_reference>818 P.2d 1048</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1051</cross_reference> (Utah Ct. App. 1991).

Section <cross_reference>76-3-401</cross_reference> requires that when choosing between consecutive and concurrent sentences, the court must "consider<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
the gravity and circumstances of the offenses, the number of victims, and the history, character, and rehabilitative needs of the defendant." Utah Code Ann. § <cross_reference>76-3-401</cross_reference>(2) (2003). A trial court is not required to explicitly note the extent to which it considered each of the factors identified in Section <cross_reference>76-3-401</cross_reference>. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v. Helms</underline>, <cross_reference>2002 UT 12</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>12</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>40 P.3d 626</cross_reference>.

Although the record does not explicitly delineate the extent to which the district court considered each of the factors set forth in section <cross_reference>76-3-401</cross_reference>, it is evident that the district court considered them. Specifically, the record demonstrates that the district court requested a presentence report and considered its recommendations. The court also considered the gravity and circumstances of Johnson's offenses, the extended nature of her criminal history, the number of victims affected by her crimes, her character, and her rehabilitation. The district court further determined that Johnson had an extensive criminal career and that earlier attempts at probation had proven to be unsuccessful.

Ultimately, the district court considered the relevant information presented to the court; it simply did not agree with the assessment that probation was an adequate sentence. Based on the totality of the evidence presented to the district court, we cannot say that the sentences imposed were clearly excessive or that the district court did not consider the relevant legal factors in making its determination.

Affirmed.

Pamela T. Greenwood, Presiding Judge, William A. Thorne Jr., Associate Presiding Judge, Gregory K. Orme, Judge.
