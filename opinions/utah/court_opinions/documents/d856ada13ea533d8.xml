<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                           MEMORANDUM DECISION</center></unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Appellant appeals his Conviction, Judgment and Sentence for two counts of Aggravated Sexual Assault, in violation of Utah Code Ann. § <cross_reference>76-5-405</cross_reference>(Supp. 1999), and one count of sodomy on a child, in violation of Utah Code Ann. § <cross_reference>76-5-403.1</cross_reference>(Supp. 1999). Appellant's appointed counsel filed an <underline>Anders</underline>-type brief pursuant to <underline>Anders v. California</underline>,<cross_reference>386 U.S. 738</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S.Ct. 1396</cross_reference> (1967) (adopted in Utah by) <underline>State v.</underline><underline>Clayton</underline>, <cross_reference>639 P.2d 168</cross_reference> (Utah 1981). The brief satisfies the requirements of this court's opinion in that case. Counsel further certified that he had provided Appellant a copy of the proposed <underline>Anders</underline>-type brief and has incorporated into the brief all issues raised by Appellant. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v.</underline><underline>Wells</underline>, <cross_reference>2000 UT App 304</cross_reference>,¶¶ <cross_reference>8-10</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>13 P.3d 1056</cross_reference>. Based on our examination of the record and all proceedings in the trial court, we determine the appeal is wholly frivolous.

Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's conviction and sentence and grant counsel's motion to withdraw.

Gregory K. Orme, Judge, William A. Thorne, Jr., Judge.
