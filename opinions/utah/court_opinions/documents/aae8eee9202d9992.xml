<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                           MEMORANDUM DECISION</center></unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This case is before the court on a sua sponte motion for summary dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <underline>See</underline> Utah R. App. P. 10(a)(1). Defendant seeks to appeal the district court's judgment rendered on May 21, 2002.

Our review of the record indicates that the district court sentenced Defendant on May 21, 2002. The district court memorialized the sentencing hearing in the record with a minute entry titled "Criminal Judgment and Sentence." However, this minute entry is not signed. The record does not contain any other signed order of judgment and sentence entered by the district court in this case. Because the record does not contain a signed final order, this court is without jurisdiction over the appeal. <underline>See</underline>
Utah R. App. P. 3(a); <underline>State v. Crowley</underline>, <cross_reference>737 P.2d 198</cross_reference> (Utah 1987) ("An unsigned minute entry does not constitute a final order for purposes of appeal.").

Accordingly, we grant the sua sponte motion and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

Pamela T. Greenwood, Judge, Gregory K. Orme, Judge.
