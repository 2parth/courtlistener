<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Appellant appeals his convictions of Operating a Vehicle Without Insurance, a class B misdemeanor, and Driving Without a License, a class C misdemeanor. This case is before the court on a sua sponte motion for summary dismissal.

This case originated in the Duchesne County West Justice Court. Appellant appealed and obtained a trial de novo in Eighth District Court.<underline>See</underline> Utah Code Ann. ยง 78-5-120(1) (Supp. 2001). Appellant filed the present appeal to this court from the district court judgment after the trial de novo.

Utah Code Ann. ยง 78-5-120(7) provides that no appeal may be taken from the judgment after trial de novo unless the court rules on the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance. In all other cases, the judgment after trial de novo is final and not appealable. <underline>See</underline> <underline>City of</underline><underline>Monticello v. Christensen</underline>, <cross_reference>788 P.2d 513</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>517</cross_reference> (Utah 1990). This court has previously stated that "`in order that the proper specific constitutional or statutory challenge be preserved, that challenge must clearly have been raised in and presented to the circuit [now district] court.'" <underline>City</underline><underline>of Kanab v. Guskey</underline>, <cross_reference>965 P.2d 1065</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1066</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1998) (quoting <underline>City</underline><underline>of Monticello v. Christensen</underline>, <cross_reference>769 P.2d 853</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>854</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1989) (per curiam)). Furthermore, a statute or ordinance must be specifically challenged on constitutional grounds, and a vague reference to constitutional rights cannot satisfy the statutory requirement. <underline>See id</underline>. "A mere allegation of a violation of one's constitutional rights is insufficient to confer jurisdiction." <underline>Christensen</underline>, <cross_reference>769 P.2d at 854</cross_reference>.

The judgment entered by the district court in this case does not contain a ruling on the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance that would serve as the prerequisite to this court's appellate jurisdiction.<underline>See</underline> Utah Code Ann. ยง 78-5-120(7). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Judith M. Billings, Associate Presiding Judge, and Gregory K. Orme, Judge, CONCUR.

I DISSENT: William A. Thorne Jr., Judge.
