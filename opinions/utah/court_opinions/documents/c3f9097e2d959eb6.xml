<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                           MEMORANDUM DECISION</center></unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM:

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This court moved sua sponte for summary disposition of this appeal on the grounds that the court appeared to lack jurisdiction. Although appellant was notified that failure to respond to the motion could result in dismissal of the appeal, he did not file a response.

Appellant's conviction and sentence were entered on October 16, 2000. The notice of appeal was filed on November 16, 2000. Rule 4(a) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment or order appealed from. When a timely notice of appeal is not filed, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider an appeal. <underline>See, e.g.</underline>, <underline>Glezos v. Frontier Inv.</underline>,<cross_reference>896 P.2d 1230</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1233-34</cross_reference> (Utah Ct.App. 1995), <underline>State v. Johnson</underline>, <cross_reference>635 P.2d 36</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>37</cross_reference> (Utah 1981).

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed.

Norman H. Jackson, Associate Presiding Judge.

Russell W. Bench, Judge, James Z. Davis, Judge.
