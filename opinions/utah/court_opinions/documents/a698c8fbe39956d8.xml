<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  ¶ 1 Mark K. Smith appeals from his sentence after pleading guilty to various crimes. Smith asserts that the district court erred by relying on Utah Code section <cross_reference>77-13-6</cross_reference>(2) to determine the time period in which Smith could file a withdrawal of his plea instead of the time period set forth in Smith's plea statement in support of his guilty plea. We lack jurisdiction to review the issue.

  ¶ 2 Smith was charged with various crimes in four separate cases. On March 30, 2006, Smith entered into a global plea deal with the State to resolve all four cases. Smith waived the time for sentencing and, accordingly, was sentenced that day. Smith later filed a letter with the court requesting that he be allowed to withdraw his plea. At the time Smith entered into the plea agreement, Utah Code section <cross_reference>77-13-6</cross_reference>(2)(b) stated that "[a] request to withdraw a guilty plea . . . shall be made by motion before the sentence is announced." Utah Code Ann. § <cross_reference>77-13-6</cross_reference>(2)(b) (2008).<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> However, a provision in Smith's statement in support of his plea stated: "I understand that if I want to withdraw my guilty plea, I must file a written motion to withdraw my plea within 30 days after I have been sentenced and final judgment has been entered."

  ¶ 3 Utah Code section <cross_reference>77-13-6</cross_reference>(2) is jurisdictional. See<italic>State v. Tenorio</italic>, <cross_reference>2007 UT App 92</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>7</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>156 P.3d 854</cross_reference>. Accordingly, if a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is not filed prior to sentencing, this court does not have jurisdiction over a direct appeal to review the validity of the plea. <italic>See</italic><italic>State v. Merrill</italic>, <cross_reference>2005 UT 34</cross_reference>, ¶¶ <cross_reference>13-20</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>114 P.3d 585</cross_reference>; <italic>see also</italic> Utah Code Ann. § <cross_reference>77-13-6</cross_reference>(2)(c) ("Any challenge to a guilty plea not made within the<page_number>Page 873</page_number>
time period specified in Subsection (2)(b) shall be pursued under Title 78B, Chapter 9, Post-Conviction Remedies Act, and Rule 65C, Utah Rules of Civil Procedure."). Therefore, because Smith did not file a motion to withdraw his plea until after his sentence was announced, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Smith's claim and has no choice but to dismiss the appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> <italic>See Merrill</italic>, <cross_reference>2005 UT 34</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>20</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>114 P.3d 585</cross_reference>. If Smith seeks to challenge the timeliness of his request to withdraw his plea, he must do so pursuant to Utah Code section <cross_reference>77-13-6</cross_reference>(2)(c).

  ¶ 4 Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The 2008 amendments to the statute merely made a technical change to the rule to reflect the recodification of the Post-Conviction Remedies Act, which is referenced in the statute.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> We express no opinion as to whether we would have jurisdiction to review a due process argument based upon the unique facts in this case because Smith has not raised that issue on appeal.</footnote_body>
