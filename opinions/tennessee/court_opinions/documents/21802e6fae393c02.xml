<opinion_byline><unpublished>  D. KELLY THOMAS, JR., JUDGE.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The Defendant, Jerry Wayne Watson, Jr., pled guilty to sale of cocaine in an amount more than .5 grams in case number 36,430 and to sale of cocaine in an amount more than .5 grams in case number 36,431. Following a sentencing hearing for both cases, the Defendant was sentenced to concurrent sentences of eight years, with 120 days in confinement followed by seven years and eight months on community corrections. In this appeal as of right, the Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying full probation. Following our review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.

According to the presentence report, the Defendant sold more than .5 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover officer on December 27, 2006 and December 29, 2006. The Defendant has a minimal criminal history consisting of traffic offenses and has attended<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
some college. The Defendant has a job and is attempting to purchase the home in which he is currently living. The Defendant admitted that he smoked marijuana from the time he was seventeen years old until he was twenty-one years old.

The Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying a sentence of full probation because he had no prior criminal history and was a perfect candidate for a probationary sentence. The State responds that the Defendant has waived review of the denial of probation because he failed to include the transcript of the guilty plea and sentencing hearing in the record on appeal. If this court determines that the Defendant's issue is not waived, the State responds that the trial court's sentencing decision is supported by the trial court's order denying a probationary sentence.

We first note that the record on appeal does not contain the guilty plea hearing transcript. The absence of the guilty plea hearing transcript is particularly important because

<block_quote>  [f]or those defendants who plead guilty, the guilty plea hearing is the equivalent of trial, in that it allows the State the opportunity to present the facts underlying the offense. For this reason, a transcript of the guilty plea hearing is often (if not always) needed in order to conduct a proper review of the sentence imposed.</block_quote>

The transcript of the sentencing hearing is also missing from the record. Without the sentencing hearing transcript, we are unable to determine whether the trial court considered the necessary sentencing principles in arriving at its sentencing determination.<underline>See</underline> Tenn.
