The appellant, Johnny C. Abrams, appeals as of right from a judgment of the trial court summarily dismissing his suit for post-conviction relief. The trial court found that the grounds raised by the appellant were barred by the statute of limitations. The appellant contends that the statute of limitations should not be a bar to his suit because (a) he has no knowledge of the law,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> (b) he is indigent and was unable to obtain counsel to represent him,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> and (c) he did not know that his rights had been seriously violated. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

This Court has thoroughly read and considered the record transmitted to this Court, the briefs of the parties, and the law governing the issues presented for review. It is the opinion of this Court that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed pursuant to Rule 20, Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.
