</unpublished></posture><concurrence_byline><unpublished>  JOHN EVERETT WILLIAMS, J., separate concurring.

</unpublished></concurrence_byline><concurrence_text><unpublished>  I agree with the majority opinion that the so-called "rule of three" evidence should have been excluded in this case, based upon the trial court's initial ruling that there was insufficient foundation laid to allow its admissibility. I write separately to express that I limit my decision to the instant case. After careful review, I concluded that the admissibility of this evidence was a very close decision and deferred, as I must, to the trial court's decision. However, with additional testimony concerning the <underline>McDaniel</underline> factors, a proper foundation might be laid for admitting expert testimony concerning the "rule of three."
