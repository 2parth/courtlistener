<center>                              <underline>INTRODUCTION</underline></center>
Petitioner David Camargo is currently serving a sentence of nine years after the trial court imposed the upper term without aggravating factors being found by a jury. On February 9, 2004, Mr. Camargo was convicted of violations of Penal Code sections <cross_reference>273.5</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>236</cross_reference> and was found by the jury to have caused great bodily injury (hereinafter "GBI") pursuant to Penal Code section <cross_reference>12022.7</cross_reference>, subdivision (e). Mr. Camargo was acquitted of the more serious charges of attempted murder, kidnaping, attempted rape, assault to commit rape, and criminal threats. The court not only used facts that were not before the jury in order to impose upper term, it also considered facts that were<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
rejected by the jurors when they acquitted Mr. Camargo of the more serious charges. The sentence imposed was in violation of Mr. Camargo's right to a jury trial on those aggravating factors as expressed by the United States Supreme Court in <underline>Cunningham</underline> v. <underline>California</underline> (2007)<cross_reference>549 U.S. 270</cross_reference>, a decision that overturned California's determinate sentencing law (hereinafter "DSL"). Mr. Camargo filed an appeal which raised this issue. It was denied. Mr. Camargo filed a Petition for Review by the California Supreme Court which was denied without prejudice pending the outcome of <underline>People</underline> v. Black, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in <underline>Cunningham</underline>.

This court should grant the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and modify Mr. Camargo's sentence to seven years instead of nine to reflect the correct statutory maximum at the time of his sentence.

By this verified petition the following facts are set forth for the issuance of the writ:

<center>                                    <bold>I</bold></center>
Petitioner was the defendant in a criminal action in case number VA075507-01. He was charged with violation of Penal Code section 664/187 (attempted murder), Penal Code section <cross_reference>273.5</cross_reference> (spousal battery), two counts of Penal Code section <cross_reference>236</cross_reference> (false imprisonment), Penal Code section 664/261, subdivision (a)(2) (attempted rape), Penal Code section <cross_reference>220</cross_reference> (assault to commit rape), two counts of Penal Code section <cross_reference>422</cross_reference>
(criminal threats), Penal Code section <cross_reference>207</cross_reference> (kidnaping) and Penal Code section <cross_reference>210.5</cross_reference> (false imprisonment to<page_number>Page 3</page_number>
avoid arrest). It was further alleged that in Counts 1-6 that in the commission of the offenses Petitioner personally inflicted great bodily injury within the meaning of Penal Code section <cross_reference>12022.7</cross_reference>, subdivision (e). (Exhibit "A," Superior Court Minute Orders, p. 1 of 46.)

<center>                                   <bold>II</bold></center>
Petitioner was acquitted of the most serious charges at a jury trial which began on January 26, 2004, and ended on February 9, 2004. (Exhibit A, pp. 19-41.) Petitioner was convicted of violations of Penal Code sections <cross_reference>273.5</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>236</cross_reference>, and the jury returned a true finding on the GBI allegation. (Exhibit A pp. 37-42.) Petitioner was not alleged to have any prior convictions. No "special interrogatories" were submitted to the jury for a determination of aggravating factors and none were proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

<center>                                   <bold>III</bold></center>
The trial court, at sentencing on March 16, 2004, imposed the high term for the conviction of Penal Code section <cross_reference>273.5</cross_reference> and consecutively imposed the high term for the GBI allegation. Sentencing for the false imprisonment charge was stayed pursuant to Penal Code section <cross_reference>654</cross_reference>. As a result of these determinations, petitioner was sentenced to the combined term of nine (9) years in state prison. (Exhibit "B," Reporter's Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, hereinafter "RT.")

At the sentencing hearing, the court stated:<page_number>Page 4</page_number>

<block_quote>    The court will select Count 2, the 273.5(a), as the base term. And considering the factors in aggravation under rule 4.421, again, number 1, the court takes into consideration that the crime did include great violence, great bodily injury or other acts disclosing a high degree of viciousness;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    2, again, the victim was particularly vulnerable;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    3, the manner in which the crime was carried out does indicate planning.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    On two separate occasions — and merely because the jury did not find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the kidnaping when he took her out to the desert, he did indicate to her that, in effect, he was going to hell. She was going to go to heaven. And that in essence was she was going to be worse off than Jesus Christ after he finished with her.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    That, fortunately, did not take place in the desert. But in the not-too-distant future the incident took place in the apartment building. And his first comments when he gets her into that room is "You're not going to like what's going to happen."</block_quote>

<block_quote>    So the court does feel there was a planning by the defendant as to what he was going to do.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    I do think, item number 4, that with this victim the defendant has engaged in violent conduct which indicates to this court that the defendant is a danger to society. (RT at pp. 31-33.)</block_quote>

<center>                                   <bold>IV</bold></center>
Petitioner asserts that the court's findings and conclusions were without legal merit and were improperly considered by the court at sentencing. The factors the court relied on in determining high term were either rejected by the jury or were never before the jury.<page_number>Page 5</page_number>

<center>                                    <bold>V</bold></center>
Petitioner is illegally held in the custody, confinement, and restraint of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He is currently held under CDC # V-30732. Petitioner alleges the illegal confinement is based upon the trial court's erroneous reliance on factors in aggravation that were not presented to the jury and are not legally cognizable as a basis for aggravating a sentence to nine years from a presumptive seven years.

<center>                                   <bold>VI</bold></center>
A timely appeal was filed and denied in Court of Appeal Case B175113 (Exhibit C). A Petition for Review was filed with the State Supreme Court and that petition was denied (Exhibit D). However, in the denial the State Supreme Court stated:

<block_quote>    Petition for review denied without prejudice to any relief to which defendant might be entitled upon finality <italic>of People v. Black</italic> (2005) <cross_reference>35 Cal.4th 1238</cross_reference>
regarding the effect of <italic>Blakely</italic> v. <italic>Washington</italic> (2004)  <cross_reference>542 U.S. 296</cross_reference>, and <italic>United States v. Booker</italic> (2005) 543 U.S.___, on California law.</block_quote>

Petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus with the Court of Appeal of the State of California, Second Appellate Division, on June 28, 2007. (Exhibit E, Order of the Court of Appeal in case number B200118.) That petition was denied without prejudice because petitioner did not first seek relief in the Los Angeles Superior Court. (Exhibit E.)

Petitioner filed another Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Superior Court which was denied by Judge Dewey Falcone on October 20,<page_number>Page 6</page_number>
2008. (Exhibit F, Order of Judge Dewey Falcone, Exhibit G, Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus [without exhibits].)

<center>                                   <bold>VII</bold></center>
Petitioner has no other adequate or speedy remedy at law.

<center>                                  <bold>VIII</bold></center>
Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm if he is subjected to completion of the illegal sentence in the state prison.

PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO HABEAS CORPUS RELIEF TO ADDRESS THE ILLEGAL SENTENCE IMPOSED ON HIM BY THE TRIAL COURT

Habeas corpus is a proper remedy to review a sentence in excess of that permitted by law and to correct the judgment so that the court will impose the only punishment lawful under the undisputed facts. (<underline>In re</underline><underline>Johnson</underline> (1966) <cross_reference>65 Cal.2d 393</cross_reference>.) Petitioner's sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law; therefore, he is unlawfully imprisoned as contemplated by Penal Code section <cross_reference>1473</cross_reference>, subdivision (a):

<block_quote>  Every person unlawfully imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, under any pretense whatever, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into the cause of such imprisonment or restraint.</block_quote><center>                                   <bold>II</bold></center><block_quote>  THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE TRIAL COURT EXCEEDED THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY LAW UNDER <underline>CUNNINGHAM</underline> v. <underline>CALIFORNIA</underline>
BECAUSE THE SENTENCE VIOLATED PETITIONER'S RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON ANY FACT THAT COULD INCREASE HIS PUNISHMENT</block_quote>

Petitioner was acquitted of the most serious charges in this case, including kidnaping, attempted murder, attempted rape, and making criminal threats. The jury rejected those charges, finding petitioner guilty of spousal<page_number>Page 9</page_number>
battery in violation of Penal Code section <cross_reference>273.5</cross_reference> and false imprisonment under Penal Code section <cross_reference>236</cross_reference>. The jury found that the GBI enhancement was true. There were no aggravating factors alleged in the complaint or submitted to the jury.

The trial court imposed a nine-year prison term, even though the legal maximum, without the jury finding facts in aggravation, was seven years. The court selected the upper term using aggravating factors that had either been specifically rejected by the jury, substituting its own judgment for that the of jurors, or not heard by the jury at all. The court stated its reasons for imposing the upper term:

<block_quote>  The court will select Count 2, the 273.5(a), as the base term. And considering the factors in aggravation under rule 4.421, again, number 1, the court takes into consideration that the crime did include great violence, great bodily injury or other acts disclosing a high degree of viciousness;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2, again, the victim was particularly vulnerable;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3, the manner in which the crime was carried out does indicate planning.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  On two separate occasions — and merely because the jury did not find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the kidnaping when he took her out to the desert, he did indicate to her that, in effect, he was going to hell. She was going to go to heaven. And that in essence was she was going to be worse off than Jesus Christ after he finished with her.</block_quote><page_number>Page 10</page_number>

<block_quote>  That, fortunately, did not take place in the desert. But in the not-too-distant future the incident took place in the apartment building. And his first comments when he gets her into that room is "You're not going to like what's going to happen."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  So the court does feel there was a planning by the defendant as to what he was going to do.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  I do think, item number 4, that with this victim the defendant has engaged in violent conduct which indicates to this court that the defendant is a danger to society. (RT at pp. 31-33.)</block_quote>

The four aggravating factors used by the court to impose a sentence greater than the legal maximum were: 1) the crime involved great violence, great bodily injury or other acts disclosing a high degree of viciousness; 2) the victim was particularly vulnerable; 3) the manner in which the crime was carried out indicated planning; and 4) that the defendant engaged in violent conduct leading the court to believe the defendant is a danger to society.

The first factor, although found by the jury only with regard to the true finding on the GBI enhancement, cannot be used both as an enhancement and an aggravating factor. (Cal. Rules of Court 4.420 (c).) The court's finding on the second factor, that the victim was particularly vulnerable, was also not a legal basis to increase the mid term because the jury never found that fact. The court, while ruling on whether to grant probation, found that the victim's gender was a factor in whether she was particularly vulnerable. The court stated, "Secondly, the court does consider the victim particularly vulnerable. I mean, she is a female." (RT at p. 31, lines 4-6.)<page_number>Page 11</page_number>

The third factor, that the crime involved great planning, was also not found by the jury. And perhaps most disturbing about the court's use of this factor to increase petitioner's sentence is the fact that the court relied on facts that were specifically rejected by the jury. In order to find this third factor, the court stated that "merely because the jury did not find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the kidnaping when he took her out to the desert, he did indicate to her that, in effect, he was going to hell. She was going to heaven. And that in essence was she was going to be worse off than Jesus Christ after he finished her." (RT at p. 32, lines 10-16.) Petitioner was acquitted of the charges the court referred to above. The jury considered and rejected those facts. Therefore, the use of those facts as aggravating factors was improper.

Finally, the last factor used by the court to impose upper term was that petitioner "is a danger to society." Again, this is a fact not found by the jury and as such, it cannot be lawfully used to increase petitioner's punishment.

On appeal after sentencing, petitioner raised this issue in the Court of Appeal and in his Petition for Review to the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court denied his petition; however, it did so without prejudice to any relief to which the defendant might be entitled upon finality of <underline>People</underline> v. <underline>Black</underline>. (<underline>People</underline> v. <underline>Black</underline> (2005)<cross_reference>35 Cal.4th 1238</cross_reference>.) At the time of his Petition for Review, the issue of whether the case of <underline>Blakely</underline> v. <underline>Washington</underline><page_number>Page 12</page_number>
applied to the California's Determinate Sentencing Law had not been decided. (<underline>Blakely</underline> v. <underline>Washington</underline> (2004) <cross_reference>542 U.S. 296</cross_reference>.) The California Supreme Court in the <underline>Black</underline> case determined that <underline>Blakely</underline> did not apply to California's DSL; however, <underline>Black</underline> did not survive U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny. In <underline>Cunningham</underline> v. <underline>California</underline>, the U.S. Supreme Court held that<underline>Blakely</underline> does apply to California's DSL and that the imposition of high term by a court, based on factors not found by a jury, is unconstitutional. (<underline>Cunningham</underline> v. <underline>California</underline> (2007) <cross_reference>549 U.S. 270</cross_reference>.) Therefore, although the <underline>Black</underline> case was decided in a manner that did not provide petitioner with relief at the time of his Petition for Review,<underline>Black</underline> was overturned by the Cunningham case and petitioner is entitled to relief.

Petitioner should have been sentenced to the middle term, rather than the upper. <underline>Cunningham</underline> made it clear that it was the mid term, not the upper term, which was the relevant statutory maximum at the time petitioner was sentenced. (<underline>Cunningham</underline> v. <underline>California</underline>, <underline>supra</underline>, <cross_reference>549 U.S. 270</cross_reference>.) Only facts that were found by a jury or admitted by petitioner could be used to enhance his sentence beyond that statutory maximum, the only exception being a prior conviction. (<underline>Ibid.</underline>) The proper remedy in this case is relief through this petition.<page_number>Page 13</page_number>

PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF BECAUSE THE CASE RELIED UPON BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT TO DENY HIS PETITION FOR REVIEW WAS OVERTURNED

The trial court that denied petitioner's habeas writ relied in part on the issue of whether the <underline>Cunningham</underline> decision would be "retroactive." The case cited by the court in its opinion dated October 20, 2008, is currently under review by the California Supreme Court. (<underline>In Re Gomez</underline>
(2008)153 Cal. App.4th 1516, review granted by <underline>In Re Gomez</underline> (2008) Cal Lexis 12045.) Argument was heard by the California Supreme Court on December 3, 2008. At issue in <underline>Gomez</underline> is whether a habeas petitioner whose conviction became final after <underline>Blakely</underline> v. <underline>Washington</underline> but before<underline>Cunningham</underline> v. <underline>California</underline> is entitled to the benefit of the high court's decision in Blakely. (<underline>www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/calendars/documents/SDECA08., PDF, as</underline><underline>of December 16, 2008</underline>.) Petitioner asserts that he is entitled to such relief because the Supreme Court in <underline>Cunningham</underline> did not make a new rule, but rather, its decision was directed by the <underline>Blakely</underline> decision. (<underline>Cunningham</underline>, <underline>supra</underline>, <cross_reference>549 U.S. 270</cross_reference>.)

A case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final. (<underline>Teague</underline> v. Lane<page_number>Page 14</page_number>
(1989) <cross_reference>489 U.S. 288</cross_reference>.) The High Court simply applied the rule already established by <underline>Blakely</underline> to the California DSL and stated as much in its opinion:

<block_quote>  As this Court's decisions instruct, the Federal Constitution's jury-trial guarantee proscribes a sentencing scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. [Citations omitted.] "[T]he relevant `statutory maximum,'" this Court has clarified, "is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <italic>without</italic> any additional findings."  <underline>Blakely</underline>, <cross_reference>542 U.S., at 303-304</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>124 S. Ct. 2531</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>159 L. Ed. 2d 403</cross_reference> (emphasis in original).</block_quote>

(<underline>Cunningham</underline> v. <underline>California</underline>, <underline>supra</underline>, <cross_reference>549 U.S. 270</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>274-275</cross_reference>.) Cunningham's holding was clearly dictated by the holding in <underline>Blakely</underline>, as evidenced by the above quote. As such, <underline>Cunningham</underline> did not advance a new rule and should be applied retroactively to petitioner's case.

In the instant case, petitioner is entitled to relief regardless of the outcome of the <underline>Gomez</underline> case because the California Supreme Court denied his petition without prejudice and the issue was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court at the time the petition was denied. The decision that the California Supreme Court relied on in denying the Petition for Review was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in <underline>Cunningham</underline>. As such, this court retains jurisdiction to modify the sentence to conform with<underline>Blakely</underline> and <underline>Cunningham</underline>.

<block_quote>  The rule is settled in this state in accord with the weight of authority that where a court has jurisdiction of the person and of the crime, the imposition of a sentence in excess of what the law permits does not render the legal or authorized portion of the<page_number>Page 15</page_number>
sentence void, but leaves only such portion of the sentence as may be in excess open to question and attack. In other words, the sentence is legal insofar as it is within the provisions of law and the jurisdiction of the court over the person and offense, and only void as to the excess when such excess is separate and may be dealt with without disturbing the valid portion of the sentence.</block_quote>

(<underline>People</underline> v. <underline>Larsen</underline> (1956) <cross_reference>144 Cal.App.2d 504</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>508</cross_reference>, citing <underline>In re</underline><underline>Seeley</underline> (1946) <cross_reference>29 Cal.2d 294</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302</cross_reference>.)

A writ of habeas corpus will issue to review an invalid sentence and the judgment may be corrected to reflect the only possible determination under the circumstances. (Downs v. State (1962) <cross_reference>202 Cal.App.2d 609</cross_reference>.) Here, the law compels that the sentence be modified to conform to the holdings of <underline>Cunningham</underline> and to set aside that portion of the sentence that is in excess of what the law permits. (<underline>People</underline> v. <underline>Larsen</underline>, <underline>supra</underline>,<cross_reference>144 Cal.App.2d 504</cross_reference>.)

Petitioner is not disputing the facts of the convictions; he challenges only the imposition of a sentence that exceeds the constitutional limits under a statutory scheme that has been determined unconstitutional as applied.<page_number>Page 16</page_number>

For all the reasons stated above, petitioner requests this court grant the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and reduce petitioner's sentence from nine years to seven years.
