</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Defendant pled no contest to charges of possession of methamphetamine for sale (Health  Saf. Code, ยง <cross_reference>11378</cross_reference>) and carrying a concealed<page_number>Page 953</page_number>
weapon (Pen. Code, ยง <cross_reference>12025</cross_reference>, subd. (b)) and was placed on probation. He appeals from the order of probation contending the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and in imposing a condition of probation requiring him to register with law enforcement officials as a narcotics offender. In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the suppression motion was properly denied. In this published portion, we hold that the registration requirement was improperly imposed as a condition of probation.

<center>                                     II</center><center>             <italic>The Condition of Probation Requiring Registration</italic></center> <bold>(1a)</bold> The challenged condition of probation states, "Defendant shall register under the provisions of Section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference> of the Health and Safety Code. . . ." That section requires persons convicted of certain drug-related offenses to register with law enforcement officials where the offender resides or stays.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>
However, defendant correctly points out he was convicted under section <cross_reference>11378</cross_reference> of the Health and Safety Code, and section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference> does not by its terms require registration following a conviction for violation of section<cross_reference>11378</cross_reference>. (Health  Saf. Code, ยง <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference>, subd. (a); further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.) Defendant argues it was therefore improper for the trial court to impose the registration condition.<page_number>Page 954</page_number>

We agree. <bold>(2)</bold> Even though defendant accepted the condition of probation, he may challenge it in this court on the ground its imposition exceeds the statutory authority of the trial court. (See <italic>People</italic> v. <italic>Chapman</italic> (1978) <cross_reference>21 Cal.3d 124</cross_reference> [<cross_reference>145 Cal.Rptr. 672</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>577 P.2d 1012</cross_reference>].) <bold>(1b)</bold> The Legislature specifically enumerated within section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference> those particular offenses for which it deemed registration appropriate; violation of section<cross_reference>11378</cross_reference> is not enumerated. <bold>(3)</bold> It is a long-standing rule of statutory construction that the expression of certain things in a statute necessarily involves exclusion of other things not expressed.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> (<italic>Dyna-Med, Inc.</italic> v. <italic>Fair Employment  Housing</italic><italic>Com.</italic> (1987) <cross_reference>43 Cal.3d 1379</cross_reference>, 1391, fn. 13 [<cross_reference>241 Cal.Rptr. 67</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>743 P.2d 1323</cross_reference>].) <bold>(1c)</bold> In section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference> the Legislature has expressed an intent to differentiate between different drug-related crimes and to require registration only for designated ones. Had the Legislature intended to require all drug offenders to register, it could have drafted the statute to accomplish that purpose. The sentencing court is therefore not free to impose registration under section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference> for convictions of crimes not listed in the statute. If it were otherwise, every sentencing court could nullify the Legislature's decision to treat convictions for different crimes in a different manner.

A similar principle has been applied in the context of interpreting the sex offender registration statute, Penal Code section <cross_reference>290</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> <bold>(4)</bold> Because registration is a highly onerous requirement, persons convicted of sex offenses not listed in section <cross_reference>290</cross_reference> may not be required to register under that statute as a condition of probation. (<italic>People</italic> v. <italic>Tye</italic> (1984) <cross_reference>160 Cal.App.3d 796</cross_reference>, 802-803 [<cross_reference>206 Cal.Rptr. 813</cross_reference>].)

<bold>(1d)</bold> In this case, we have no occasion to determine whether a trial court might properly impose a condition of probation requiring a defendant convicted of violation of section<cross_reference>11378</cross_reference> to report his address to a local police department informally and without regard to the requirements of section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference>. Here, the condition of probation expressly required registration under section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference>. That statutory registration triggers associated statutory obligations, such as furnishing fingerprints and photographs to the Department<page_number>Page 955</page_number>
of Justice. (ยง 11594.) Moreover, a knowing violation of the registration requirements is a misdemeanor. (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) The trial court could not subject defendant to these specific statutory obligations and disabilities where the Legislature, by its omission of defendant's crime from section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference>, has manifested an intent that registration is not required. (See <italic>People</italic> v.<italic>Chapman, supra,</italic> 21 Cal.3d at p. 126.)

The trial court erred in imposing a condition of probation requiring defendant to register under section <cross_reference>11590</cross_reference>. The order granting probation is modified by striking the aforementioned condition.

As modified, the judgment (order) is affirmed.
