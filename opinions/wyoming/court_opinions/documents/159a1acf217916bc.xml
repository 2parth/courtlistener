<syllabus>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW — STATUTES — LEGISLATURE — JUDICIAL DISTRICTS — STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION — DISTRICT JUDGES — SUPREME COURT.

<block_quote>  1.  Unless it clearly appears that a challenged act is in conflict with the constitution, it must be upheld and all doubts must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality. 2.  The legislature may do anything within the domain of legislation, which is not expressly or by necessary implication inhibited. 3. Constitutional restrictions on legislative power are not to be enlarged by construction beyond their terms. 4.  The legislature is ordinarily the sole judge of the wisdom and expediency of statutes. 5.  The state legislature in increasing or decreasing the number of judicial districts, exercises a common and proper legislative function. 6.  The use of wrong numbers in designating districts in a section of an act decreasing and changing boundaries of judicial districts of the state, is insufficient to invalidate the act for indefiniteness where other sections clearly show what districts are abolished. 7.  Article V, Secs. 19 and 20 of the state constitution authorize the legislature to increase or diminish the number of judicial districts in the state, unrestricted by Article V, Section 21 of the constitution, except as to removal of a judge from office and the increasing of districts before taxable valuations of property exceed a certain amount. 8.  In the construction of terms and provisions of the state constitution and statutes, the rule, <italic>"expressio unius est exclusio alterius,"</italic>
must be applied with caution. 9.  There is no mode by which a legislative act may be made irrepealable except it assume the form and substance of a contract. 10. The constitution does not prohibit a decrease in the number of judicial districts as established by preceding legislatures.<page_number>Page 217</page_number>
11. The Supreme Court will limit the operation of a statute when necessary, to avoid a conflict with provisions of the state constitution. 12. As district judges are elected to preside over districts which may be changed, Chapter 44, Laws 1933, changing the boundaries of judicial districts (a power authorized by Article V, Section 21, state constitution) is unaffected by Article V, Section 11 of the state constitution.</block_quote>

This action was brought under the Declaratory Judgment Statute by plaintiff to test the constitutionality of Chapter 44, Laws of 1933. It will be noted that by this act, only two of the old districts are left intact; eight counties of the state are placed in other districts than those to which they belonged under the old law; two districts are eliminated, and two district judges are removed from office. This act is not an amendment to the then existing laws providing for judicial districts, but repeals existing laws and itself constitutes<page_number>Page 218</page_number>
all of the statute law of the state upon the subjects embraced herein. The case is important in that it involves the validity of all judicial districts in the state, and the act in question is believed to be an unwarranted interference by the legislative branch with the functions of the judicial branch of the state. The case is submitted on five (5) separate propositions, which will be discussed in their order. The provisions of the constitution involved are: Article I, Sec. 1; Article II, Sec. 1; Article III, Sec. 27; Article V, Secs. 1, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20, 21; Article XII, Secs. 1 and 2 and Article XIX, Sec. 10. Before proceeding with our main argument, we desire to direct the court's attention to the authorities cited on the introductory pages in the Attorney General's brief, all of which, we believe, will be found to be based upon constitutional provisions differing from Wyoming, except certain of said decisions either differing from the present case on the facts or having no bearing whatsoever upon the questions here involved.

<heading>PROPOSITION I.</heading>
The legislature has no power or authority to reduce the number of judicial districts in Wyoming. No such authority appears in the constitution. Article V, Section 21 of the constitution authorizes an increase of districts but no authority to decrease districts appears therein, nor is such authority implied. MacDonald v. Doust, 81 P. 60; State v. Sheldon, (Wyo.) <cross_reference>213 P. 92</cross_reference>; Rhyne v. Lipscombe, (N.C.) <cross_reference>29 S.E. 57</cross_reference>; State v.

<heading>PROPOSITION II.</heading>
The legislature has no power or authority to shorten the term of, or diminish the compensation of any district judge. State v. Friedley, (Ind.) <cross_reference>34 N.E. 872</cross_reference>; Commonwealth v. Gamble, (Pa.) 1 Am.Rep. 422; State v. Handy, (Ohio) <cross_reference>36 N.E. 1071</cross_reference>; Crozier v.

<heading>PROPOSITION III.</heading>
The legislature has no power or authority to provide for the election of a district judge, by electors residing outside of that judicial district at the time of such election. Section 4 of Chapter 44, aforesaid, is a direct contradiction of the foregoing constitutional provision.

<heading>PROPOSITION IV.</heading>
The legislature has no power or authority to appoint a judge to serve over a portion of a judicial district to which he was neither elected or appointed by constitutional authority, or to serve over a district in which there is no regularly elected or appointed judge. By Section 5 of Chapter 44, Laws 1933, it has been attempted to assign judges to serve in the newly established sixth and seventh districts. This is illegal. Hoglan v. Geddes, <cross_reference>25 Wyo. 436</cross_reference>.

<heading>PROPOSITION V.</heading>
Chapter 44, Laws 1933, is void because of indefiniteness, ambiguity and uncertainty as to what districts are attempted to be abolished and what are the jurisdiction and powers of the several judges affected by said law, and who may be candidates in 1934 for judicial<page_number>Page 220</page_number>
office in the several affected districts. Attorney General v. Gaitskill, (Kan.) <cross_reference>300 P. 336</cross_reference>.

For the defendant, there was a brief by <italic>Ray E. Lee</italic>, Attorney General; <italic>O.O. Natwick</italic>, Deputy Attorney General, and <italic>William C. Snow</italic>, Assistant Attorney General, of Cheyenne, and oral argument by <italic>Mr. Natwick.</italic>
It is believed that the controlling authorities in the case are as follows: Vandeventer v. Rose, (Ill.)<cross_reference>67 N.E. 746</cross_reference>; State v. Cochran, (Ore.) <cross_reference>105 P. 884</cross_reference>; State v. Rusk, (Wash.) <cross_reference>46 P. 387</cross_reference>; People v. Sassovich, <cross_reference>29 Cal. 480</cross_reference>; State v. Gardner, (Mo.) <cross_reference>265 S.W. 996</cross_reference>; McCulley v. State, (Tenn.) <cross_reference>53 S.W. 134</cross_reference>; Lytle v. Halff, (Texas) 12 S.W. 610; State v. Lewis, (Utah) <cross_reference>72 P. 388</cross_reference>; State v. Commissioners, (Nev.) <cross_reference>10 P. 901</cross_reference>; Aikman v. Edwards, (Kan.) <cross_reference>42 P. 366</cross_reference>; State v. Schnitger, <cross_reference>17 Wyo. 65</cross_reference>; 7 R.C.L., Section 11, page 983. The legislature may add to or may take from the territory constituting a circuit. It may create new circuits. It may abolish a circuit, if the act be made to take effect at, and not before, the expiration of the terms of office of the judge and prosecutor of such office, as constituted, at the time of the act. The power to detach counties from one district and add them to another is within the legislative authority, and the change of a county from one judicial circuit to another whose judges the qualified voters of the county had no voice in electing does not violate a constitutional provision that the judges shall be elected by the qualified voters of the district. The legislature has the power to abolish as well as to create; to diminish as well as to increase the number of districts so long as it does not reduce the number below that originally specified. The questions of law raised in the case at bar are well covered by the above decisions. People v. Rose, <cross_reference>166 Ill. 422</cross_reference>. Where a general power is conferred upon the law-making body by the constitution, it also gives, by implication, every particular power necessary<page_number>Page 221</page_number>
for the exercise of the one or the performance of the other. Field v. People, 2 Scam. 79; City of Chicago v. Stratton, (Ill.) <cross_reference>44 N.E. 853</cross_reference>; Cooley's Const. Lim (2d Ed.) 63. There is a seeming conflict between Sections 5 and 6 of Article VI of the constitution, but it is readily explained. State v. Cochran, (Ore.) <cross_reference>105 P. 884</cross_reference>; State v. Rusk, 46 P. 387; People v. Sassovich, <cross_reference>29 Cal. 480</cross_reference>; 19 R.C.L. 769; McCulley v. State, (Tenn.) <cross_reference>53 S.W. 134</cross_reference>; Lytle v. Halff, (Texas) 12 S.W. 610; State v. Lewis, (Utah) <cross_reference>72 P. 388</cross_reference>; State v. Commissioners, (Nev.) <cross_reference>10 P. 901</cross_reference>; Aikman v. Edwards, (Kan.) <cross_reference>42 P. 366</cross_reference>; In re Fourth Judicial District, <cross_reference>4 Wyo. 133</cross_reference>; State v. Schnitger,<cross_reference>17 Wyo. 65</cross_reference>. It is true that Section 21 of Article V of the constitution states that any increase or change in the boundaries of the district shall not work the removal of any judge from his office during the term for which he may have been elected or appointed. It is contended that this act shortens the term of office of judges from the first Monday in January, 1935, to the 31st day of December, 1934. But it is apparent from the provisions of the act, when all portions thereof are considered, that the intent was not to interfere with the term of any judge, for which he was elected, but that his term should extend to the first Monday in January, 1935.

District courts are constitutional courts, and the judges thereof are elected by the electors of such district for terms of six (6) years. The office is created by the constitution. 15 C.J. 855. There is no provision in the constitution for decreasing the number of districts. The presumption is that the language has been employed with sufficient precision to convey the intent. Rasmussen v. Baker, <cross_reference>7 Wyo. 117</cross_reference>. The maxim,<italic>"expressio unius est exclusio alterius"</italic> applies. 12 C.<page_number>Page 222</page_number>

If the effect of the act of 1933 is to create a vacancy in the office of judge of the sixth district, then, under the holdings of this court, such vacancy must be filled either at a special election or by appointment by the Governor. State v. Jefferis, <cross_reference>26 Wyo. 115</cross_reference>. The statute must yield to the constitution. State v. Berg, (Minn.) <cross_reference>157 N.W. 652</cross_reference>; State v.

It is clear from the language of the constitutional provisions here involved, that the framers of the constitution acted with great wisdom in declining to give the legislature the power to reduce the number of judicial districts.

<opinion_byline>   KIMBALL, Chief Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   When Wyoming became a state it was divided into three judicial districts. Thereafter from time to time the number of districts has been increased until now, under an act of 1927, there are nine, described in section 31-201, R.S. 1931. There has always been one judge for each district. In 1933 the legislature passed an act entitled "An Act to reduce the number of judicial districts and the number of district judges from nine judicial districts and from nine district judges to<page_number>Page 223</page_number>
seven judicial districts and seven district judges; to re-define the judicial districts of this state * * *." This action is under the declaratory judgment act (§§ 89-2401 to 89-2416), brought by plaintiff, judge of the sixth judicial district, for the purpose of determining whether or not the act of 1933 is constitutional. The case is here on nine reserved constitutional questions.

The act (Ch. 44, Laws of 1933) is in seven sections. Section 1 provides that "for the purposes of this act, on and after the 31st day of December, 1934, and until otherwise provided by law, the State of Wyoming is hereby divided into seven judicial districts," which are then described.

The counties of Laramie, Goshen and Platte shall compose the first districts; Campbell, Johnson and Sheridan, the fourth district; Big Horn, Hot Springs, Park and Washakie the fifth district; Crook, Niobrara and Weston the sixth district; and Converse, Natrona and Fremont the seventh district. The second and third districts are not changed.

The reduction from nine to seven districts is made by abolishing the sixth district which now includes Converse, Niobrara and Goshen Counties, and the ninth district which includes Fremont and Hot Springs Counties. When the law becomes operative Converse and Fremont Counties will be attached to the eighth district which will then be known as the seventh district; Niobrara County will be attached to the seventh district which will then be known as the sixth district; Goshen County will be attached to the first district, and Hot Springs to the fifth. Besides these changes, Campbell County, now in the seventh district, will be attached to the fourth district.

Sections 2, 3 and 6 of the act are not material on the questions presented.<page_number>Page 224</page_number>

Sections 4, 5 and 7 are as follows:

"Section 4. That no nomination of a candidate for judge of the present Ninth Judicial District, as same is now defined in Section 31-201, Wyoming Revised Statutes, 1931, shall be made at the primary election to be held in the year 1934, and no election for a judge of said Ninth Judicial District shall be held at the general election to be held in the year 1934; and that no nomination of a candidate for judge of the present Sixth Judicial District as same is now defined in said Section 31-203, Wyoming Revised Statutes, 1931, shall be made at said primary election, and no election for a judge of said Sixth Judicial District shall be held at such general election; provided, however, that the electors of any county that has been changed by this Act to a District where an election for District Judge shall be held at the general election in the year 1934, shall be permitted to vote for District Judge within said new district at the primary and general election held in such year, and the election officials charged with that duty shall provide ballots for such primary and general election.

"Section 5. That the Judge of the Eighth Judicial District as hereby abolished shall serve and act as Judge of the Seventh Judicial District until a Judge of the Seventh Judicial District as hereby created is elected and qualified; that the Judge of the Seventh Judicial District as hereby abolished shall serve and act as Judge of the Sixth Judicial District until a Judge of the Sixth Judicial District as hereby created is elected and qualified; and that succeeding judges shall be elected in such districts at the election next preceding the date of expiration of the respective terms of office of each of said Judges.

"Section 7. Section 4 of this Act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and all other sections of this Act shall take effect and be in force from and after the 31st day of December, A.D. 1934."

In considering the reserved questions we must keep in mind a few accepted principles that serve as guides in determining whether or not the legislature has acted<page_number>Page 225</page_number>
in excess of its powers under the state constitution. Unless it clearly appears that a challenged act is in conflict with the constitution, it must be upheld, and all doubts must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality. State ex rel. v. Snyder, <cross_reference>29 Wyo. 163</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>179</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>212 P. 758</cross_reference>. The legislature may do anything within the domain of legislation which is not expressly or by necessary implication inhibited. Budge v. Commissioners, <cross_reference>29 Wyo. 35</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>44</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>208 P. 874</cross_reference>. Constitutional restrictions on legislative power are not to be enlarged by construction beyond their terms. State ex rel. v. Irvine, <cross_reference>14 Wyo. 318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>389</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>84 P. 90</cross_reference>. The legislature is ordinarily the sole judge of the wisdom and expediency of statutes. State v. W.S. Buck Merc. Co., <cross_reference>38 Wyo. 47</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>264 P. 1023</cross_reference>; White v. Hinton,<cross_reference>3 Wyo. 753</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>30 P. 953</cross_reference>, 17 L.R.A. 66.

Counsel for plaintiff seem to think that the case presents important questions affecting the independence of the judiciary, and the separation of the powers of government into three departments. It seems, however, that a legislature, in increasing or decreasing the number of judicial districts, exercises a common and proper legislative function. See 7 R.C.L. 983. There is no reason for claiming that the power should be conferred on the courts or that the courts can interfere with its exercise by the legislature except in so far as may be necessary to prevent violations of constitutional restrictions that limit the power.

We come now to a consideration of the several reserved questions.

By question 8 we are asked: "Is Chapter 44 unconstitutional and void because of indefiniteness, ambiguity and uncertainty as to the whole chapter and particularly Section 5 thereof, when read in connection with the other sections of said chapter?"<page_number>Page 226</page_number>

The supposed indefiniteness arises from the fact that section 5 refers to the eighth and seventh judicial districts as being "hereby abolished." This is not an accurate statement. The districts abolished are the sixth and ninth. The boundaries of the seventh and eighth districts are changed and the districts renumbered, as shown above. The numbering of districts is a matter of convenience and not of vital importance. See State ex rel. v. Draper, <cross_reference>50 Mo. 353</cross_reference>. The purpose of section 5 is to make it clear that the judges of the present seventh and eighth districts will continue as judges of the districts which under the new law will be known as the sixth and seventh districts respectively. Section 1 and 4 of the act show what districts are abolished. When the whole act is considered there is no such indefiniteness as would justify a holding that it is void. See 25 R.C.L. 810; 59 C.J. 606.

By reserved questions 1 and 6 we are asked if the act in question is unconstitutional in that it purports to reduce the number of judicial districts from 9 to 7 in violation of section 21 of article 5 of the state constitution. The plaintiff contends that by the provisions of the mentioned section of the constitution the legislature is prohibited from enacting any law that reduces the number of judicial districts. Section 21, and the two preceding sections, are copied below.

Section 19, Article 5. "Until otherwise provided by law, the state shall be divided into three judicial districts, in each of which there shall be elected at general elections, by the electors thereof, one judge of the district court therein, whose term shall be six (6) years from the first Monday in January succeeding his election until his successor is duly qualified.

Section 20, Article 5. "Until otherwise provided by law, said judicial districts shall be constituted as follows: District number one shall consist of the counties of Laramie, Converse and Crook. District number two shall consist of the counties of Albany, Johnson and<page_number>Page 227</page_number>
Sheridan. District number three shall consist of the counties of Carbon, Sweetwater, Uinta and Fremont.

Section 21, Article 5. "The legislature may from time to time increase the number of said judicial districts and the judges thereof, but such increase or change in the boundaries of the district shall not work the removal of any judge from his office during the term for which he may have been elected or appointed; provided the number of districts and district judges shall not exceed four until the taxable valuation of property in the state shall exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000)."

Looking first at sections 19 and 20, we find that "until otherwise provided by law" the state is divided into three judicial districts. Here is clear authority for the legislature to increase or diminish the number of districts mentioned. When we come to examine section 21 we are looking for restrictions on the legislative power recognized in the two preceding sections. We find no express restriction, except as to the removal of a judge from office and as to increases before the taxable valuation of property exceeds the stated amount. We find the statement that "the legislature may from time to time increase the number of said judicial districts," a clause that seems to add nothing to the power already recognized in the preceding sections. The plaintiff contends that from this clause arises the necessary implication that the legislature is prohibited from making any reduction in the number of districts. The rule that <italic>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</italic> is invoked. We have said that this rule must be applied with caution. Chicago  N.W. Ry. Co. v. Hall, (Wyo.)<cross_reference>26 P.2d 1071</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1073</cross_reference>. If it has any application in the present case, it cannot lead to a construction that would prohibit the legislature from reducing the number of districts added by the acts of previous legislatures. When in section 21 it is said that the legislature may from time to time increase<page_number>Page 228</page_number>
the number of districts, the "number" in mind is three. The thing expressed is the power to increase that number. The thing that should be excluded, if the mentioned rule or construction be applied, is the power to reduce that number. It may be, therefore, that the legislature by necessary implication is prohibited from reducing the number of districts below three.

Plaintiff in effect asks us to hold that section 21 means that any legislature has the power to increase the number of judicial districts by an irrepealable statute, although it is generally thought that there is no mode by which a legislative act can be made irrepealable except it assume the form and substance of a contract. See Bloomer v. Stolley, 5 McLean, 158, 161; Cooley, Const. Lim. (8th ed.) 246.

Section 21 refers not only to increases but also to "change in the boundaries." Counsel for plaintiff say that neither increases in the number of districts nor changes in the boundaries of existing districts would work the removal of a judge, there being no law requiring a judge to live in his district. If that be so, it would seem that the framers of the section must have had in mind some power in the legislature to do more than increase the number of districts and change the boundaries of existing districts. They must have had in mind the power to abolish districts if, as counsel argue, that is the only kind of a change that would remove a judge from office. Having had in mind the abolishing of districts, they prohibited those changes that would work the removal of a judge during his term. This would seem to imply permission to abolish districts if no judge is thereby removed from office.

In Ex parte Johnson, <cross_reference>203 Ala. 579</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>84 So. 803</cross_reference>, the court, considering an act abolishing a judicial circuit, said: "Indeed, the provision of section 155 of the constitution that the right of a judge to his full term shall<page_number>Page 229</page_number>
not be affected by any change made in any circuit necessarily implies that changes in circuits were authorized and were to be anticipated; the inhibition being against disturbance of the term of the judge before its expiration."

Our conclusion that the constitution does not prohibit a decrease in the number of judicial districts as established by preceding legislatures is supported by the authorities that throw light on the subject. The cases show that the conclusion is reinforced by a compelling public policy.

In Coleman v. Campbell, 3 Shannon's Tenn. Cas. 355, it was insisted that the power of the legislature "to ordain and establish circuit and chancery courts," did not include the power to abolish existing courts, but that it only extended to adding to or increasing them. The court said:

"If this position be correct, it may follow that at some future time, the legislature upon a real exigency might ordain and establish several additional circuit and chancery courts in different localities, which courts could not afterwards be abolished, even if the change in the country should make it ever so plain that they had become unnecessary and a useless burden. It is even possible, under this view, that we might have a legislature which would determine that the public good required a separate circuit and a separate chancery court in every county in the state, * * *. Of course such a state of things is only possible — yet it would result that a subsequent legislature would have no power to so ordain and establish courts as to diminish their number, their only power being that of increasing it. The result would follow from giving the words `ordain and establish' their literal meaning, and also assuming that the power thus given to `ordain and establish' excludes any other power by the legislature. We are unable to yield our assent to either of the positions."<page_number>Page 230</page_number>

And see McCulley v. State, <cross_reference>102 Tenn. 509</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>53 S.W. 134</cross_reference>, 46 L.R.A. 567; State ex rel. v. Clinton, 26 La. Ann. 406, 409.

By the constitution of Washington it was provided that "there shall be in each of the organized counties of the state a superior court," with a proviso that until otherwise directed by the legislature one judge only should be elected for each of several specified groups of counties. In State ex rel. v. Rusk, <cross_reference>15 Wn. 403</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>46 P. 387</cross_reference>, it was conceded that the construction best warranted by the language of the constitution was that the legislature had no jurisdiction as to superior court districts except to declare when the grouping contained in the proviso should terminate and the general provision given effect. But that construction was not adopted. The court said, among other things, that "the technical construction would prevent the legislature from taking steps which the highest considerations of public policy and the economical administration of governmental affairs might require. Thereunder the legislature would be powerless to reduce the number of judges in the state by enlarging any group of counties entitled jointly to elect a judge, however much the business therein might decrease, and however clear it might be that an election by the larger group would subserve the public interests."

In State v. McBride, <cross_reference>29 Wn. 335</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>70 P. 25</cross_reference>, the court had occasion to consider the meaning of a section of the Washington constitution which provided that the supreme court should consist of five judges, and that: "The legislature may increase the number of judges of the supreme court from time to time." After some discussion of the meaning of the phrase "from time to time," the court said, among other things:

"But whatever may be the technical meaning of the words, they certainly cannot be held to mean that<page_number>Page 231</page_number>
the legislature may not decrease the number of judges after increase thereof. If, therefore, the legislature has power to increase the number of judges as occasion or convenience requires, and there is no restriction upon a decrease, except below five, it follows that a decrease may be had to this minimum when necessity or occasion requires, of which necessity or occasion the the legislature is the exclusive judge."

In Ailman v. Edwards, <cross_reference>55 Kan. 751</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>42 P. 366</cross_reference>, 30 L.R.A. 149, the supreme court of Kansas upheld a statute which abolished three judicial districts by changing the boundaries of the other districts. The constitution provided that "the state shall be divided into five judicial districts in each of which there shall be elected a district judge who shall hold his office for the term of four years." The only express authority for changing districts was that "provision may be made by law for the increase of the number of judicial districts whenever two-thirds of the members of each House shall concur." It was held, not only that the legislature had power to abolish districts created by previous legislatures, but that it could do so without a two-thirds vote.

It is contended that the act of 1933 shortens the terms and diminishes the salaries of the judges of the present 6th and 9th judicial districts. The point is raised by reserved questions 2 and 5, which refer to Section 21 of Article 5, above, which contains the provision that an "increase or change in the boundaries of the district shall not work the removal of any judge from his office during the term for which he may have been elected or appointed," and Section 17 of Article 5 which provides that "compensation shall not be increased or diminished during the term for which a judge shall have been elected."

The term of an elected district judge is "6 years from the first Monday in January succeeding his<page_number>Page 232</page_number>
election until his successor is duly qualified." Section 19 of Article 5, copied above. The terms of the judges of the present sixth and ninth districts, abolished by the act, will expire the first Monday, the seventh day, of January, 1935. The act declares that it (except section 4) shall take effect "on and after," or "from and after" December 31, 1934. If it takes effect before January 7, 1935, it will shorten by a few days the constitutional terms of office of the judges of the abolished districts. The attorney general concedes that the act, if put in force at the time therein provided, is void. The only question, therefore, is whether we should sustain the act by holding that its operation must be postponed until January 7, the time when it may become effective without conflict with the constitution.

This court has frequently been confronted with the necessity of limiting the operation of a statute to avoid a conflict with the constitution. See Commissioners v. Woods, <cross_reference>18 Wyo. 316</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>106 P. 923</cross_reference>, 107 P. 753; Salt Creek Trans. Co. v. Commission, <cross_reference>37 Wyo. 488</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>496</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>263 P. 621</cross_reference>, and cases cited. It is not at all uncommon for the court by construction so to limit a statute as to make it operative on only those persons, things or situations to which it may apply without violating the superior law. We see no good reason for holding that this power to limit the operation of a statute may not be properly exercised in the present case by postponing the operation of the act of 1933 until the first Monday in January. The legislature intended that the act should be in operation on that date but, in ignorance of its powers, declared that it should be in operation a few days earlier. The act, in so far as it provides that it shall be effective from December 31 to January 7, is held to be unconstitutional, but this partial invalidity does not warrant a declaration that the act is void.<page_number>Page 233</page_number>

The constitution of Texas required that two terms of the district court should be held each year in each county. The legislature passed an act which, if effective at the time as therein provided, would have deprived a county of one of its annual terms of court, and the act for that reason would have been void. In Ex parte Murphy, <cross_reference>27 Tex. App. 492</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>11 S.W. 487</cross_reference>, the act was upheld by postponing its operation. The court said that:

"In construing an act of the legislature, it is the duty of the court to so interpret the legislative intent as to harmonize the provisions of the act with the constitution, if this can be done reasonably. It must be presumed that the legislature did not intend to disregard the above-cited provision of the constitution * *. If such was the intent, the act would be void. Notwithstanding the emergency clause in said act * * * we feel justified in holding that it was not the legislative intent that said act should immediately take effect, but that it should become operative only at a time when it would not deprive any county in the district of two terms of court."

The rule announced in Ex parte Murphy has been applied many times by the courts of Texas. See Engelman v. Anderson  (Tex.Civ.App.) <cross_reference>244 S.W. 650</cross_reference>. See, also, Ex parte Johnson, <cross_reference>203 Ala. 579</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>84 So. 803</cross_reference>.

It has been held that a statute is not void because of the invalidity of a section that declares that the act shall become effective immediately (Riley v. Carrico, <cross_reference>27 Okla. 33</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>110 P. 738</cross_reference>), or that its operation shall be postponed (Gottstein v. Lister, <cross_reference>88 Wn. 462</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>153 P. 595</cross_reference>).

By the act of 1933, Goshen County will not become a part of the first judicial district until the first Monday in January, 1935, but the electors of that county are permitted to vote for district judge at the primary and general elections to be held this year. The same<page_number>Page 234</page_number>
condition obtains with reference to Campbell County which becomes a part of the fourth district. Reserved questions 3 and 9 ask if this is forbidden by either Section 27 of Article 3 or Section 19 of Article 5 of the constitution. The constitutional provisions referred to are:

"Section 27, Article 3: "The legislature shall not pass local or special laws in any of the following enumerated cases, that is to say: * * * the opening or conducting of any election or designating the place of voting * * *. In all other cases where a general law can be made applicable no special law shall be enacted."

Section 19 of Article 5, copied above, which declares that the state shall be divided into three districts, "in each of which there shall be elected at general elections, by the electors thereof," one judge etc.

We cannot see that these questions suggest anything of substance opposed to the validity of the act. No authorities are cited. Although the electors of Goshen County will not be residents of the first judicial district when the next primary and general elections are held, they are and will be residents of territory that will be in that district when the elected judge takes office. Indeed, it would seem not only proper, but necessary, that the electors of Goshen County and Campbell County should be permitted to vote as the act provides. Otherwise, it would be hard to see how it could be said that the elected judges were chosen by the electors of the district as provided by section 19 of article 5.

The arguments have not made clear the supposed application of section 27 of article 3. All we need say is that we do not think the act in question contains any provision that can be held to be a local or special law prohibited by that section.

The remaining questions, numbered 4 and 7, have reference to the transfer of counties from the abolished<page_number>Page 235</page_number>
districts to districts in which a judge will not be elected at the coming election. For example, Hot Springs County, in the present ninth district, will become a part of the fifth district under the jurisdiction of a judge in whose choice the people of the transferred county have had no voice. The constitutional provisions referred to are section 7 of article 4, and section 11 of article 5, copied below.

Section 7, Article 4: "When any office from any cause becomes vacant, and no mode is provided by the constitution or law for filling such vacancy, the governor shall have the power to fill the same by appointment."

Section 11, Article 5: "The judges of the district courts may hold courts for each other and shall do so when required by law."

The act does not create any vacancy in office within the meaning of section 7 of article 4. It is suggested that it appoints judges for the transferred counties. This is not a correct view. The judges have been elected to preside over districts which may be changed. By the act in question the legislature simply changes the boundaries of the districts under the power which, as already pointed out, is recognized by section 21 of article 5 of the constitution. This power has been freely exercised by past state legislatures and we have no reason for believing that it has ever been questioned except in the present case. See, Ailman v. Edwards,<cross_reference>55 Kan. 751</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>42 P. 366</cross_reference>, 30 L.R.A. 149; McCulley v. State, <cross_reference>102 Tenn. 509</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>53 S.W. 134</cross_reference>, 46 L.R.A. 567; State ex rel. v. Gardner, 218, Mo. App. 217, <cross_reference>265 S.W. 996</cross_reference>; Commonwealth v. Gamble, 62 Pa. St. 343, 352, dicta.

We do not think the power of the legislature to change the boundaries of districts is at all restricted by section 11 of article 5 providing that judges may or shall hold court for each other.<page_number>Page 236</page_number>

The reserved questions will be answered in accordance with our conclusions, as expressed above, that chapter 44 of the laws of 1933 is not void for any reason stated in the questions.

BLUME and RINER, JJ., concur.
