<opinion_text>  Appellant-plaintiff appeals from that portion of a divorce decree which awarded custody of the 18-month-old son of the parties to appellee-defendant, the wife.

We affirm.

Appellant words the issues for review on this appeal as follows:

<block_quote>  "a) Did this case, and does the procedure in Wyoming trial courts in child custody cases, deny equal protection and due process to fathers?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  "b) Are the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law supported by the evidence?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  "c) Should Wyoming's tender years doctrine and/or maternal preference be overturned?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  "d) Did the trial court properly apply applicable statutory law?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  "e) Are the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law properly structured?"</block_quote>

Such issues and appellant's argument upon them are founded on the contention that the award of child custody was here made on a presumption that the wife is entitled to custody if the relative fitness of the parties are the same. Appellant describes the system for determining custody in Wyoming as being a "mud-slinging" contest rather than a "no fault" system as was intended by the legislature in a 1977 amendment of ยง<cross_reference>20-2-113</cross_reference>(a).<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> He contends<page_number>Page 543</page_number>
that the trial courts improperly continued to apply a "maternal presumption" articulated in<italic>Butcher v. Butcher</italic>, Wyo., <cross_reference>363 P.2d 923</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>924</cross_reference> (1961) that, "ordinarily the care and custody of young children should be awarded to the mother"; that of the recognition by the mother of this attitude of the courts tends to encourage her to seek a divorce rather than expending more effort toward a successful marriage; and that a "matriarchal" society results in which many children are raised only by their mothers. He argues that the father has a heavier burden of proof than does the mother in that he must show his fitness and the mother's unfitness to prevail whereas the mother can prevail upon the showing of her own fitness only. This, he says, is a denial of equal protection of the laws.

These policy and philosophical arguments<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> have no pertinency to the facts of this case. Appellant points to finding of fact number 32 made by the trial court, i.e., "[t]hat both the plaintiff and the defendant are fit and proper persons to have the care, custody and control of said minor child," to support his contention that the child custody award was made on an improper and illegal assumption that such custody is ordinarily to be that of the mother. Appellant completely disregards the other findings of fact made by the court which reflect consideration given by it to all aspects of the relationship in an effort to make the award which would be in the best interests of the child.

The following findings of fact and conclusions of law as made by the trial court indicate the consideration given by the court to factors other than one "solely" on gender of the parents as required by ยง <cross_reference>20-2-113</cross_reference>(a) in making the determination of child custody:

<block_quote>  "* * *."</block_quote><page_number>Page 545</page_number>

The ultimate goal in awarding child custody is to accomplish the best interests of the child. This is expressed in ยง<cross_reference>20-2-113</cross_reference>(a), supra. In its opinion letter, the trial court said that in making the award to appellee in this case, it:

<block_quote>  "* * * found on the balancing of all of the testimony and evidence in the case that it would be in the best interests of said minor child to so award custody in this case."</block_quote>

There is no basis for appellant's contention that a "maternal presumption" was applied in this case. Therefore, he cannot support error with reference to issues, a, c and d here presented for review.

In support of his argument that the findings of fact and conclusions of law were not supported by the evidence (issue b), appellant refers to testimony adverse to appellee's "fitness" to be awarded custody of the child and to testimony such as that of a psychologist who testified that in her opinion sex should not be a determining factor in awarding custody and that "with two parents being equal in the majority, then I would favor probably the same sex parent." We have said:

<block_quote>  "* * * There are settled appellate concepts which we follow, all for the most part favorable to the party prevailing in the trial court. An appealing party has a heavy burden to overcome. We must assume that the evidence in favor of the successful party is true, leave out of consideration entirely the evidence of the unsuccessful party that conflicts with it and give the evidence of the successful party every favorable inference which may reasonably and fairly be drawn from it. <italic>Jelly v. Dabney</italic>, Wyo. 1978,  <cross_reference>581 P.2d 622</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>624</cross_reference>; <italic>Laramie Rivers Co. v.

In this case, there were special findings of fact which must be construed liberally and favorably to the judgment. We presume that they are right and where the findings of the trial court are not inconsistent with the evidence, clearly erroneous, or contrary to the great weight of the evidence, they will not be disturbed on appeal. <italic>Diamond Management</italic> <italic>Corp. v.

Moreover, the trial judge was present and observed at first hand the demeanor and expressions of the witnesses. We must not forget that when we examine the cold words of the transcript of testimony, we do not have the benefit of how the trial judge sees and hears the witness โ the pitch of the voice, facial changes, the movement in the witness โ all of which may tell a separate story, to be given credence. The conclusion of what preponderates is with the trier of fact. <italic>Koch v. Brown</italic>, Wyo. 1965, <cross_reference>401 P.2d 459</cross_reference>.

Although there were negative factors relative to awarding child custody to appellee (as appellant notes), a review of the record discloses the existence of positive factors in that respect as well as both positive and negative factors pertaining to an award of custody to appellee. There is testimony in the record to support the findings of fact made by the court.

<block_quote>  "There is no rule of law which says only persons without faults can be parents. Seldom if ever does a divorce court have a choice between a parent who is all good on one side and a parent who is all bad on the other side. The matter of awarding custody is a comparative proposition wherein the court exercises its best judgment and discretion and awards custody to one parent or to the other, according to what the court thinks is for the best interest and welfare of the children." <italic>Wilson v. Wilson</italic>, Wyo.,  <cross_reference>473 P.2d 595</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>598</cross_reference> (1970).</block_quote><page_number>Page 546</page_number>

The final issue here presented by appellant (issue e) challenges the "structure" of the findings of fact as being ultimate findings rather than findings of basic facts, citing,<italic>Pan American Petroleum Corporation v. Wyoming Oil and Gas</italic><italic>Conservation Commission</italic>, Wyo., <cross_reference>446 P.2d 550</cross_reference> (1968). In that case, the findings which were considered "ultimate" were such as:

<block_quote>  "* * * that Rule 302 was a valid regulation; that the evidence did not demonstrate present waste in the field; that the evidence was not sufficiently definite and certain to permit the commission intelligently to enter an order for protection of correlative rights in terms of allocation of production of the parties' properties on a reasonable basis; and in so-called finding number seven stated:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    "`That the evidence submitted unto the Commission does not, without undue speculation, establish sufficient cause for the granting of an exception to rule 302 unto applicant to drill a well upon the Meeteetse No. 15 Tract for the protection of applicant's correlative rights.'" 446 P.2d at 553.</block_quote>

The findings of fact here made are not "ultimate" as were those considered in Pan American. The determination of the child's best interest in making a custody award in a divorce case is a question of fact for the trier of fact. <italic>Taylor v. Taylor</italic>, Wyo.,<cross_reference>388 P.2d 192</cross_reference> (1964); <italic>Butcher v. Butcher</italic>, supra; 27B C.J.S. Divorce ยงยง 308(b), 309(2), and 310.

Appellant contends that there is a conflict between finding of fact number 32 to the effect that both parties are fit and proper persons to have custody of the child and the findings of fact which reflect derogatory characteristics of the parties. We again note the quotation, supra, from Wilson, and we point out that the trial court exercised its discretion in making the decision relative to child custody and visitation. In its discretion, it found derogatory characteristics in both parties, but not of sufficient magnitude to make either unfit to have custody of the minor child. It also found that the best interests of the child would be served by awarding custody to appellee. We find no reason to disagree.

<block_quote>  "A court does not abuse its discretion unless it acts in a manner which exceeds the bounds of reason under the circumstances. In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether or not the court could reasonably conclude as it did. An abuse of discretion has been said to mean an error of law committed by the court under the circumstances. * * *" <italic>Martinez v. State</italic>, Wyo.,  <cross_reference>611 P.2d 831</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>838</cross_reference> (1980).</block_quote>

Affirmed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Prior to 1977, the section was 20-61, W.S. 1957. It read:

<block_quote>  "The court, in granting a divorce, and also upon pronouncing a decree of nullity of a marriage, may make such disposition of, and provision for, the children as shall appear most expedient under all the circumstances, and most for the present comfort and future well-being of such children; and the court may from time to time afterward on the petition of either of the parents, revise and alter such decree concerning the care, custody and maintenance of such children, as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children shall require."</block_quote>

Section <cross_reference>20-2-113</cross_reference>(a), W.S. 1977 reads:

<block_quote>  "(a) In granting a divorce or annulment of a marriage, the court may make such disposition of the children as appears most expedient and beneficial for the well-being of the children. The court shall consider the relative competency of both parents and no award of custody shall be made solely on the basis of gender of the parent. On the petition of either of the parents, the court may revise the decree concerning the care, custody and maintenance of the children as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children requires."</footnote_body></block_quote>
