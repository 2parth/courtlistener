<opinion_text><unpublished>  <bold>{¶ 1}</bold> On July 17, 2003, this court issued an entry dismissing the Court of Claims as defendant and requiring the plaintiff, within 30 days of the date of the entry, to submit an amended complaint which names an appropriate state agency, department, board or commission as defendant.

  <bold>{¶ 2}</bold> A check of the docket reveals plaintiff has failed to comply with this court's order and, accordingly, plaintiff's case is DISMISSED without prejudice. Court costs are waived. The clerk shall serve upon all parties notice of this entry and its date of entry upon the journal.
