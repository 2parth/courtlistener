<opinion_text><unpublished>  <bold>{¶ 1}</bold> This case is sua sponte assigned to Judge Joseph T. Clark to conduct all proceedings necessary for decision in this matter.

  <bold>{¶ 2}</bold> On December 10, 2009, the magistrate issued a decision recommending judgment for defendant.

  <bold>{¶ 3}</bold> Civ. R. 53(D)(3)(b)(i) states, in part: "A party may file written objections to a magistrate's decision within fourteen days of the filing of the decision, whether or not the court has adopted the decision during that fourteen-day period as permitted by Civ. R. 53(D)(4)(e)(i)." Plaintiff timely filed his objection.

  <bold>{¶ 4}</bold> Upon review of the record, the magistrate's decision and the objection, the court finds that the magistrate has properly determined the factual issues and appropriately applied the law. Therefore, the objection is OVERRULED and the court adopts the magistrate's decision and recommendation as its own, including findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein. Judgment is rendered in favor of<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
defendant. Court costs are assessed against plaintiff. The clerk shall serve upon all parties notice of this judgment and its date of entry upon the journal.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
