<posture>  IN PROHIBITION.

On July 22, 1974, the Zanesville city council passed Ordinance No. 74-94 which rezoned certain acreage in the Mt. Auburn section of Zanesville. On August 21, 1974, William N. McCoy, Jr., Robert D. Cultice, and Carl f. Funk, intervenors<footnote_reference>[fn*]</footnote_reference> herein, filed petitions for referendum of the ordinance with the acting clerk of Zanesville. The petitions were on forms prescribed by the Secretary of State (form No. 31-I), and contained valid signatures in excess of ten percent of the registered voters of Zanesville. Each petition set forth the names of only three petitioners as the proponents and committee in charge of the measure, in accordance with the form prescribed by the Secretary of State, which directs: "committee of not less than three petitioners."

However, Section 79 of the Charter of the city of Zanesville requires that every referendum petition bear the names of five petitioners as the proponents and committee in charge of the measure.

On August 29, 1974, the acting city clerk refused to certify the petitions to the board of elections, solely because the petitions did not bear the names of five electors as required by the city charter.

On September 27, 1974, the three original petitioners proffered to the city clerk the names of two additional petitioners,<page_number>Page 24</page_number>
Mary Vashti Funk and Billie Lou McCoy, in order to comply with the charter requirement.

On October 2, 1974, the Court of Common Pleas of Muskingum County (case No. 74-669) issued a writ of mandamus compelling the clerk of the city of Zanesville to certify the petitions to the Board of Elections of Muskingum County, respondent herein. The clerk, complying with the writ, certified the petitions to respondent on October 2, 1974.

Relators were not parties to the mandamus action in the Court of Common Pleas, and the record does not indicate whether relators attempted to intervene in that action. The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, which ordered the issuance of the writ of mandamus and which made the placing of the referendum on the ballot a practical certainty, has not been appealed.

On October 3, 1974, the relators filed a protest with respondent, contesting the placing of the referendum on the ballot for the election to be held on November 5, 1974. Upon the basis of the writ of mandamus issued by the Court of Common Pleas, the board of elections determined that the protest would be overruled "unless a ruling is obtained from a court of higher jurisdiction."

As of October 2, 1974, the respondent had issued in excess of one hundred absentee ballots for the November 5, 1974 election. None of the absentee ballots contained the subject referendum measure. However, no affected absentee voters are before this court.

Respondent intends to place the referendum issue before the voters of the city of Zanesville on November 5, 1974, unless prohibited from doing so by order of this court.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Relators seek to prevent the respondent board of elections from submitting a referendum to the electorate on a zoning ordinance. Respondent's proposed action is at the direction of a writ of mandamus issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Thus, upon the basis of <italic>State, ex rel. Flannery</italic>, v. <italic>Sidwell</italic> (1970), <cross_reference>24 Ohio St.2d 74</cross_reference>, a writ of prohibition is not appropriate in this case.

<italic>Writ denied.</italic>

O'NEILL, C.J., HERBERT, CORRIGAN, STERN, CELEBREZZE, W. BROWN and P. BROWN, JJ., concur.
