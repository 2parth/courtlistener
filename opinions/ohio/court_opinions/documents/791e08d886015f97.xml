<posture>  IN PROHIBITION.

The F.J. Heer Printing Company, relator herein, claims to have been awarded a contract for the printing of material for the General Assembly during the next biennium. Another bidder, The Columbus Blank Book Company, brought an action in the Common Pleas Court against the Director of Finance and the State Purchasing Agent, seeking to have the claimed Heer company contract declared illegal and to compel the defendants to enter into a contract with the plaintiff (Columbus Blank Book Company) for this printing. The Heer company was not made a party to that suit, but an attorney representing it was present throughout the trial and defended the action as attorney for the defendants therein.

The court found that the action of the defendants in attempting to award the contract to the Heer company was illegal, void and of no effect, enjoined defendants from proceeding under the terms of the claimed contract, and directed defendants to award the contract to the blank book company.

The instant action in prohibition was instituted in this court by the Heer company against the judges of the Common Pleas Court and the clerk thereof, seeking a writ prohibiting them from signing, approving or filing a final order or judgment in the Common Pleas Court case, above referred to, and from taking any further action therein.
