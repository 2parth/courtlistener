2. This Court reviews <italic>de novo</italic> the adjudicatory record made before the West Virginia Board of Law Examiners with regard to questions of law, questions of application of the law to the facts, and questions of whether an applicant should or should not be admitted to the practice of law. Although this Court gives respectful consideration to the Board of Law Examiners' recommendations, it ultimately exercises its own independent judgment. On the other hand, this Court gives substantial deference to the Board of Law Examiners' findings of fact, unless such findings are not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.

3. Pursuant to Rules 4.2(b), 5.0 and 5.2(b) of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law, in order to be eligible for admission to the practice of law in this State, an applicant must prove that he or she possesses good moral character.

4. When assessing the moral character of an applicant whose background includes a criminal conviction, the following factors should be considered: (1) The nature and character of the offenses committed; (2) The number and duration of offenses; (3) The age and maturity of the applicant when the offenses were committed; (4) The social and historical context in which the offenses were committed; (5) The sufficiency of the punishment undergone and restitution made in connection with the offenses; (6) The grant or denial of a pardon for offenses committed; (7) The number of years that have elapsed since the last offense was committed, and the presence or absence of misconduct during that period; (8) The applicant's current attitude about the prior offenses (e.g., acceptance of responsibility for and renunciation of past wrongdoing, and remorse); (9) The applicant's candor, sincerity and full disclosure in the filings and proceedings on character and fitness; (10) The applicant's constructive activities and accomplishments subsequent to the criminal convictions; and (11) The opinions of character witnesses about the applicant's moral fitness. These factors are intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

5. Even though, pursuant to Rule 7.0 of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law, the West Virginia Board of Law Examiners issues a certificate of eligibility, and files it along with a character report, with this Court, for an applicant for admission to the practice of law, this Court is not required to admit that applicant. If this Court determines that the applicant possesses the necessary qualifications for admission, it will, pursuant to its inherent power to define, regulate and control the practice of law in this State, admit the applicant to the practice of law. However, if this Court determines that the applicant does not possess the necessary qualifications for admission, it will, pursuant to its inherent power to define, regulate and control the practice of law in this State, deny the applicant's admission to the practice of law.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This matter is before this Court upon the application of John Curtis Dortch who, in 1975, pleaded guilty to second degree murder, attempted armed robbery and conspiracy, for admission to the practice of law in the State of West Virginia. Though the West Virginia Board of Law Examiners (hereinafter "Board") voted three to two to recommend Mr. Dortch's admission to the bar and subsequently issued a certificate of eligibility and filed it with this Court for his admission, this Court denies Mr. Dortch's admission to the practice of law in this State.

<center>                                   I.  <italic>Applicant's Background and Underlying</italic> <italic>Felony Offenses</italic></center>
The applicant was born in 1945 and was graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1968 with a bachelor of arts degree in history and double minors in government and business. He served in the United States Army from 1968 through 1969 as an infantry officer, volunteering for active duty in Vietnam and receiving an honorable medical discharge as a result of injuries sustained in combat.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

Following his discharge from the military, Mr. Dortch returned to the Washington, D.C. area where, from 1969 through 1974, he enjoyed a successful career as a field underwriter for New York Life Insurance Company. He also became a registered representative with the National Association of Securities Dealers.

In 1974, the applicant founded JCD Enterprises, an operational holding company. For various reasons, JCD Enterprises faced financial failure in its first year. The applicant made legitimate efforts to obtain a capital infusion from investment bankers and underwriters. When these efforts proved unsuccessful, the applicant, in his words "panicked," and as a result, engineered a conspiracy to commit an armed robbery of the Columbia Federal Savings  Loan Association in Washington, D.C.

On September 20, 1974, the applicant and one of the other seven co-conspirators he assembled, John W. Bryant, parked two blocks from the bank. The couple was dressed in construction gear, complete with hard hat, work clothing and work boots.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
Underneath their work clothing, the men wore civilian clothing. Mr. Dortch carried a bricklayer's bag containing various weapons.

While still approximately two blocks from the bank, the applicant was stopped on the sidewalk by a police officer in an unmarked cruiser who had apparently been alerted of the robbery scheme by an informant. Upon sensing that the applicant was carrying a weapon, the police officer tried to snatch it away, at which time the weapon, a sawed-off shotgun, discharged, causing powder burns under the applicant's eye. No one else was injured.

In the midst of the commotion, both Mr. Dortch and Bryant fled, but in different directions. The applicant shed his construction clothing in a nearby warehouse and, in his civilian clothing, re-entered pedestrian traffic, caught a bus and escaped. In the meantime, Bryant was apprehended by a District of Columbia police officer, twenty-four year old Gail Cobb. Officer Cobb had not pulled her weapon on Bryant when he shot and killed her. She was one of the first female police officers in the United States to be killed in the line of duty. The applicant, who was not at the scene where Officer Cobb was killed, heard about it on the radio. He surrendered to police shortly thereafter.

Mr. Dortch was subsequently indicted and tried on numerous counts related to the conspiracy, attempted bank robbery and felony murder. During the trial, however, the applicant entered a guilty plea to second degree murder, conspiracy and attempted armed robbery. He was sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison.<page_number>Page 574</page_number>

During his incarceration, the applicant was, by all accounts, a model prisoner. He received numerous college credits as a student through Louisiana State University and training as an accountant in the UNICOR Federal Prison Industries.

Upon his release in 1990, having served fifteen years in prison, Mr. Dortch worked as business manager for the Covenant Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. and then, in 1991, enrolled in law school at the District of Columbia School of Law. While in law school, the applicant was elected president of the Student Bar Association, Lieutenant Governor for the Student Division of the American Bar Association for the Eleventh Circuit, Chairman of the Committee on Racial and Ethnic Diversity and received the Dean's Cup for leadership at the law school. Mr. Dortch graduated in May of 1994 and has passed, in addition to the bar examination of West Virginia, the Maryland and District of Columbia bar examinations, though he has not been admitted in those jurisdictions.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

Since graduating from law school, the applicant has been an adjunct professor at the District of Columbia School of Law, has worked as a paralegal at a Charleston, West Virginia law firm, and has volunteered with summer youth employment programs. He has also been active in local church functions, counseling and bible prayer sessions. The applicant had no criminal arrests or convictions prior to his criminal activities in 1974 and, likewise, has had no arrests or convictions since then.

<center>                                   II.  <italic>Bar Application Procedure</italic></center>
Mr. Dortch's application for admission to practice law in the State of West Virginia was received by the Board on or about October 25, 1995. The applicant's application, which revealed his felony convictions and prison term,<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> was eventually referred to the District 8 Character Committee (hereinafter "Character Committee") for investigation<page_number>Page 575</page_number>
and report.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> Following an investigation and interview of the applicant, the Character Committee, by letter to the Board dated January 17, 1996, indicated that

<block_quote>  if the Committee were to judge Mr. Dortch on his current character, without the background of the serious felonious activity, we would certainly recommend him for admission to the West Virginia Bar. Our Courts have seemed to have said on several occasions that the simple fact of a conviction of a serious crime precludes a person from being entitled to the license to practice law. If that is the rule in West Virginia, then Mr. Dortch should not be admitted.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    If, however, the Board of Bar [sic] Examiners believes that felonious activity and the conviction can be overcome by complying with a lengthy prison sentence exhibiting sincere contriteness and convincing his law school faculty and fellow students and associates of his sincerity, then it is clear that all of these exculpating factors are present and Mr. Dortch should be admitted as he would seem to be otherwise duly qualified.</block_quote>

The Board subsequently conducted an interview of the applicant on February 12, 1996, during its regularly-scheduled meeting. Following the meeting, the Board permitted the applicant to sit for the February 1996 bar examination but postponed deciding his character and fitness to practice law and eligibility for admission until after he had successfully completed the examination. As indicated above, Mr. Dortch passed the February 1996 bar examination.

At the Board's June 20, 1996 meeting, its six attending members reviewed the applicant's application and supporting documentation, as well as the Character Committee's investigation and report and the Board's own interview of the applicant on February 12, 1996. By a vote of three to three, a majority vote being required to certify eligibility for admission, the Board denied Mr. Dortch's application for admission. In its June 27, 1996 letter to the applicant notifying him of its decision, the Board indicated that the "[g]rounds for disapproval of [his] application include but are not limited to . . . [his] . . . [c]riminal history which includes a felony conviction for second degree murder, attempted armed robbery and conspiracy."<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

The June 27, 1996 letter advised the applicant that, pursuant to Rule 5.3,<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> he could<page_number>Page 576</page_number>
then withdraw his application or request a formal hearing.<italic>See</italic> Rule 6.0 of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law ("Administrative hearing procedure"). The applicant requested a formal administrative hearing.

A formal hearing was conducted on August 2, 1996 before Hearing Examiner Michael J. Del Giudice, Esquire. At the August 2, 1996 hearing, the applicant and four witnesses testified in support of the former's good moral character and fitness to practice law. The witnesses all agreed that Mr. Dortch had been no less than forthright about his criminal past and indicated that he took full responsibility for the armed robbery scheme which resulted in the death of a District of Columbia police officer.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> Mr. Dortch himself was very candid in providing the Board with the details of his life before, during and after prison.

The record further consisted of the applicant's entire file with the Board and his curriculum vitae. In a decision dated September 16, 1996, recommending admission, Hearing Examiner Del Giudice concluded that the applicant has accepted and complied with all punishments rendered against him as a result of the heinous crime he committed in 1974; that he "has gone beyond what has been asked of him for the purposes of rehabilitation[;]" that he "has completely rehabilitated himself and is presently a contributing member of society, high community standing, and a person who has presented himself to the Board, Hearing Examiner and to those who have testified on his behalf as a person of good moral character fit to practice law in the State of West Virginia." The hearing examiner further concluded that "[w]hile the Board has presented evidence to contradict the same, all such evidence existed in 1974, and none of it carries over beyond that time period[;]" and finally, that the applicant's "present good moral character outweighs his 20 year old criminal history."

During its November 5, 1996 meeting and following review of the hearing examiner's recommendations and the administrative hearing record, the Board voted three to two<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> to recommend to this Court that the applicant be admitted to the West Virginia bar. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 7.0(a)<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law, the Board presented to this Court a certificate of eligibility, certifying that the applicant has been found eligible for admission to practice law in this State. In an order dated November 7, 1996, this Court determined that the Board had not submitted adequate findings of fact and recommendations to enable it to review the applicant's eligibility. The Court, on its own motion, remanded the matter to the Board with directions to submit adequate written findings of fact and recommendations to enable this Court to review the applicant's eligibility.

On December 16, 1996, the Board filed with this Court its findings of fact and recommendations. The Board majority indicated that it was persuaded that the applicant's<page_number>Page 577</page_number>
demonstrated course of rehabilitative conduct amply supports the conclusion that he now possesses the requisite character and fitness for the practice of law. Certainly, it was of substantial concern to all members of the Board that the criminal conduct engaged in by the applicant twenty-two years ago was serious in nature and resulted in grave consequences. However, the [Board] is also mindful of its obligation to determine an applicant's<italic>present</italic> character and fitness qualifications. In view of the past criminal misconduct, Mr. Dortch carried a heavy burden in demonstrating that he has clearly overcome the personal shortcomings and misjudgments that led him into criminal activity.

Among the requirements for admission is that the applicant possess good moral character.

This Court has held the following with regard to judicial review of lawyer disciplinary proceedings:

<block_quote>    `A <italic>de novo</italic> standard applies to a review of the adjudicatory record made before the [Lawyer Disciplinary Board] as to questions of law, questions of application of the law to the facts, and questions of appropriate sanctions; this court gives respectful consideration to the [Board's] recommendation while ultimately exercising its own independent judgment. On the other hand, substantial deference is given to the [Board's] findings of fact, unless such findings are not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.'

This standard of review is consistent with our inherent power to define, regulate and control the practice of law in this State, <italic>W. Va. Const</italic>. art.

Most jurisdictions have no <italic>per se</italic> rule denying admission to applicants with prior felony convictions. Maureen M. Carr,<italic>The Effect of Prior Criminal Conduct on the Admission to</italic><italic>Practice Law: The Move to More Flexible Admission Standards</italic>, 8 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 367, 368-69, 379-90 (1995). Rather, in an attempt "to strike a balance among several competing concerns[,] [that of] protecting the public, safeguarding the image of the legal profession, and allowing a fully rehabilitated individual the opportunity to serve the community in the capacity of his or her choice[,]" the majority of states "have established rebuttable presumptions of disqualification." <italic>Id</italic>. at 383-84.

Thus, while "evidence of criminal convictions usually suggests unfitness and therefore should be considered in the overall assessment of an applicant's fitness to practice law[,][e]vidence of the applicant's reform and rehabilitation must also be taken into account." <italic>In re Manville</italic>, <cross_reference>494 A.2d 1289</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>1295</cross_reference> (D.C.Ct.App. 1985), <italic>remanded</italic>, <cross_reference>538 A.2d 1128</cross_reference> (1988)<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> and citations therein (footnotes<page_number>Page 579</page_number>
omitted). In addition, courts must conclude that admission of the applicant will not have a "justifiable and substantial adverse effect on the public confidence in the administration of justice[.]" Syl. pt. 1, in part, <italic>In re Brown</italic>, <cross_reference>166 W. Va. 226</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>273 S.E.2d 567</cross_reference> (1980).<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference> <italic>See Matter of Prager</italic>, <cross_reference>422 Mass. 86</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>661 N.E.2d 84</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>90</cross_reference> (1996) ("The allowance of an applicant's original admission to the bar is . . .

Rhode, <italic>Moral Character as a Professional Credential</italic>, 94 Yale L.J. 491, 507-12 (1985).

As a result of an applicant's criminal conviction, courts place a heavy burden upon him or her to show good moral character. <italic>See Prager</italic>, 661 N.E.2d at 90-91; <italic>In re Polin</italic>,<cross_reference>596 A.2d 50</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>53</cross_reference> (D.C.Ct.App. 1991), <cross_reference>630 A.2d 1140</cross_reference> (1993)<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference> ("In general, `an applicant with a background of a conviction of a felony or other serious crime must carry a very heavy burden in order to establish good moral character.'")

In West Virginia, Rule 5.2(b) of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law provides that an applicant seeking admission to the practice of law "shall at all times have the burden of proving his or her good moral character before the District Character Committee, the Board, and the Court." Rule<page_number>Page 580</page_number>
5.2(b), in relevant part. <italic>See</italic> Rules 4.2(b)<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference> and 5.0,<italic>supra</italic><footnote_reference>[fn17]</footnote_reference> of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law.<italic>See also Pushinsky</italic>, <cross_reference>164 W. Va. at 745-46</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>266 S.E.2d at 450</cross_reference>; Rule 4.1(c) of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law. Though Rule 5.2(b) does not distinguish between an applicant who has been convicted of a felony and other applicants, we agree with the majority of states that an applicant who has previously been convicted of a felony or other serious crime carries a heavy burden of persuading this Court that he presently possesses good moral character sufficient to be invited into the legal community of this State. <italic>See In re Brown</italic>, <cross_reference>164 W. Va. 234</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>237</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>262 S.E.2d 444</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>445</cross_reference> (1980), <italic>remanded</italic>, <cross_reference>166 W.

We note, however, as did the Supreme Court of New Jersey, that "in the case of extremely damning past misconduct, a showing of rehabilitation may be virtually impossible to make. In all cases, the need to ensure the legitimacy of the judicial process remains paramount." <italic>In re Matthews</italic>, <cross_reference>94 N.J. 59</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>462 A.2d 165</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>176</cross_reference> (1983).<footnote_reference>[fn18]</footnote_reference> <italic>See Manville</italic>, 494 A.2d at 1296.

In the first <italic>Manville</italic> decision,<footnote_reference>[fn19]</footnote_reference> the District of Columbia Court of Appeals set forth eleven factors, intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, derived from the United States Supreme Court decision of <italic>Schware v.

<block_quote>  1. The nature and character of the offenses committed.</block_quote>

2. The number and duration of offenses.

<block_quote>  3. The age and maturity of the applicant when the offenses were committed.</block_quote>

<italic>Manville</italic>, 494 A.2d at 1296-97 (citations omitted). Although "`there is no litmus test by which to determine whether an applicant for admission to the Bar possesses good moral character[,]'" <italic>Id.</italic>, 494 A.2d at 1297 (<italic>quoting</italic><page_number>Page 581</page_number><italic>Application of Allan S.</italic>, <cross_reference>282 Md. 683</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>387 A.2d 271</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>275</cross_reference> (1978)), we find these factors to be instructive nevertheless.

By his own admission, Mr. Dortch assembled seven other individuals to carry out an elaborate armed robbery conspiracy. At that time, the applicant was twenty-nine years old, a seasoned military veteran and an experienced businessman. Clearly, his criminal mischief was in no way attributable to his youth, immaturity or inexperience.

The robbery scheme, the result of which was intended to fund a failing financial venture, ended in the tragic death of a young police officer. We are well aware that Mr. Dortch did not actually pull the trigger that killed Officer Cobb and that he was not at the scene when she was killed. However, in employing several deadly weapons as part of the conspiracy, the death of an innocent third party was nonetheless foreseeable and, arguably, inevitable.

We acknowledge Mr. Dortch's commendable prison record, his present dedication to community service and his extensive rehabilitative efforts during the seven years since his release from prison. We further note his candor in admitting his guilt and responsibility in the death of Officer Cobb. However, we are mindful that attorneys

<block_quote>  occupy a special position because they are actively involved in administering the legal system whose ultimate goal is the evenhanded administration of justice. Integrity and honor are critical components of a lawyer's character as are a sense of duty and fairness. Because the legal system embraces the whole of society, the public has a vital expectation that it will be properly administered. From this expectancy arises the concept of preserving public confidence in the administration of justice by [denying admission to those] who fail to conform to professional standards.</block_quote>

Though Mr. Dortch may have demonstrated that he has been rehabilitated, we believe the horrendous crime of which he was the prime conspirator outweighs his present good deeds. Indeed, the magnitude of his crimes constitutes an "`indelibly negative mark'" on this applicant's record. <italic>Application of Avcollie</italic>,<cross_reference>43 Conn. Sup. 13</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>637 A.2d 409</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>412</cross_reference> (1993). We firmly believe that it would be detrimental to the public interest and the public's confidence in the integrity of the legal profession<footnote_reference>[fn20]</footnote_reference> were we to admit Mr. Dortch to the practice of law in this State.<footnote_reference>[fn21]</footnote_reference>

As we indicated above, pursuant to Rules 4.2(b), 5.0 and 5.2(b) of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law, in order to be eligible for admission to the practice of law in this State, an applicant must prove that he or she possesses good moral character.<page_number>Page 582</page_number>

Furthermore, when assessing the moral character of an applicant whose background includes a criminal conviction, the following factors should be considered: (1) The nature and character of the offenses committed; (2) The number and duration of offenses; (3) The age and maturity of the applicant when the offenses were committed; (4) The social and historical context in which the offenses were committed; (5) The sufficiency of the punishment undergone and restitution made in connection with the offenses; (6) The grant or denial of a pardon for offenses committed; (7) The number of years that have elapsed since the last offense was committed, and the presence or absence of misconduct during that period; (8) The applicant's current attitude about the prior offenses (e.g., acceptance of responsibility for and renunciation of past wrongdoing, and remorse); (9) The applicant's candor, sincerity and full disclosure in the filings and proceedings on character and fitness; (10) The applicant's constructive activities and accomplishments subsequent to the criminal convictions; and (11) The opinions of character witnesses about the applicant's moral fitness. These factors are intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. <italic>See Manville</italic>, 494 A.2d at 1296-97.

Finally, even though, pursuant to Rule 7.0 of the Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law, the West Virginia Board of Law Examiners issues a certificate of eligibility, and files it along with a character report, with this Court, for an applicant for admission to the practice of law, this Court is not required to admit that applicant. If this Court determines that the applicant possesses the necessary qualifications for admission, it will, pursuant to its inherent power to define, regulate and control the practice of law in this State, admit the applicant to the practice of law. However, if this Court determines that the applicant does not possess the necessary qualifications for admission, it will, pursuant to its inherent power to define, regulate and control the practice of law in this State, deny the applicant's admission to the practice of law. <italic>See</italic> syl. pt. 4,<italic>Karl, supra</italic>.

For the reasons discussed herein, we conclude that Mr. Dortch has failed to carry the burden of establishing that he possesses the moral character sufficient to practice law in this State. Although the Board issued a certificate of eligibility and filed it with this Court for his admission, we deny his admission, as he does not possess the good moral character necessary for admission to the practice of law in this State. Accordingly, the certificate of eligibility for the admission of John Curtis Dortch to the practice of law in the State of West Virginia is refused.

Admission to the Practice of Law Denied.

Justice DAVIS, deeming herself disqualified, did not participate in the decision of this case.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The applicant also received several commendations for his military service, including the Combat Infantry Badge.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> According to the applicant, he believed they would be less conspicuous dressed as construction workers, as there was much construction going on in the area near the bank.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> During its investigation of the applicant, the Board received documentation from bar admission authorities in both Maryland and the District of Columbia, where the applicant passed bar examinations in February of 1995 and July of 1995, respectively. The Board was advised by letter of June 11, 1996 that the District of Columbia Committee on Admissions had voted to hold in abeyance further consideration of the applicant's application pending the outcome of the Maryland admission proceedings.

Though Maryland's Sixth Judicial Circuit Character Committee had voted six to one to recommend Mr. Dortch's admission to the Maryland bar and the Maryland Board of Law Examiners adopted the Character Committee's findings, recommending his admission, the Court of Appeals of Maryland, the final admitting authority in that state, denied the applicant's admission. In a decision filed January 6, 1997, the Court of Appeals of Maryland concluded that the applicant's petition for admission was premature because he remains on parole supervision:

<block_quote>    A person on parole is still serving a prison sentence, albeit, beyond the prison walls.  <italic>State v. Parker</italic>, <cross_reference>334 Md. 576</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>588</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>640 A.2d 1104</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1110</cross_reference> (1994). We will not even entertain an application to admit a person to the practice of law when that person is still directly or indirectly serving a prison sentence for a crime so severe that disbarment would be clearly necessitated if the crime were committed by an attorney. We conclude that Dortch's petition for admission to the Maryland Bar is premature. Once Dortch is released from parole supervision, he can request that this Court assess whether he is eligible for admission to the bar. We shall not consider Dortch's petition for admission until that time.</block_quote>

The Court of Appeals further emphasized that it expressed no judgment as to the applicant's admissibility should he reapply for admission in the future.

We note that the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision denying Mr. Dortch's admission to the bar in that jurisdiction was filed after the hearing examiner in this case submitted his recommendation to the West Virginia Board of Law Examiners and after the Board recommended admission to this Court. <italic>See</italic>
