<opinion_text>  MEMORANDUM OF DECISION.

After a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court, Kennebec County, the defendant was convicted of the criminal violation of operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, <cross_reference>29 M.R.S.A. ยง 1312-B</cross_reference> (Supp. 1984-1985). The defendant raises several constitutional issues, all related to the State's determination to proceed against him criminally under<cross_reference>29 M.R.S.A. ยง 1312-B</cross_reference> rather than civilly under<cross_reference>29 M.R.S.A. ยง 1312-C</cross_reference>. In light of our holding in <italic>State v. Freeman,</italic><cross_reference>487 A.2d 1175</cross_reference> (Me. 1985), that section 1312-C is unconstitutional, we need not consider the issues raised by the defendant and express no opinion thereon. <italic>State v. Brown,</italic> <cross_reference>488 A.2d 939</cross_reference>, 941 (Me. 1985).

The entry is:

Judgment affirmed.

All concurring.
