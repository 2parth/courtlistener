<opinion_text>  Robert Waldron appeals from the judgments entered in the Superior Court (Cumberland County, <italic>Brennan, J.</italic>) finding him guilty of six counts of unlawful sexual contact<page_number>Page 149</page_number>
and 17 counts of gross sexual misconduct. <cross_reference>17-A M.R.S.A. ยง 253</cross_reference>
(1)(B), 255(1)(C) (Supp. 1993). Waldron argues that the trial court erred in submitting a document to the jury which identified each count by the location in which it allegedly occurred. We affirm the judgments.

Waldron was indicted on 19 counts of unlawful sexual contact and 27 counts of gross sexual misconduct with [A.R.], a minor. This indictment did not identify the counts by the specific location in which they allegedly occurred. Waldron entered a plea of not guilty to all the counts. At the conclusion of the State's evidence at the trial, the court granted a judgment of acquittal for 13 counts of unlawful sexual contact and ten counts of gross sexual misconduct, leaving six counts of unlawful sexual contact and 17 counts of gross sexual misconduct to be resolved by the jury. To aid the jury in its deliberations, the trial court prepared a document, primarily with the advice of the State's attorney, which listed the remaining counts and identified each by the location in which each alleged event was alleged to have occurred.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Despite Waldron's objection, the trial court distributed a copy of this document to each juror as it instructed them. Each juror took this document into the jury room. The jury found Waldron guilty on all counts. The trial court entered judgments in accordance with the verdicts from which Waldron appeals.

Waldron contends that the trial court violated <cross_reference>14 M.R.S.A. ยง 1105</cross_reference>
(1980).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> He argues that because the document identified the various counts by a location not contained in the indictment but based on the testimony of the State's witnesses, the locations alleged were facts in controversy and<page_number>Page 150</page_number>
by distributing the document to the jury the court gave the State's evidence its judicial stamp of approval in violation of section 1105. Although extreme caution is warranted any time the trial court gives a written statement to the jury due to its potential for prejudice, in this case the document submitted to the jury did not impermissibly express an opinion of the court on any controverted fact in issue.

As we have previously stated in <italic>State v. Kessler,</italic><cross_reference>453 A.2d 1174</cross_reference>, 1176 (Me. 1983), "since 1887 in criminal cases, <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Day,</italic> <cross_reference>79 Me. 120</cross_reference>, 125, 8 A. 544 (1887), the statute in question has been interpreted to apply only to controverted facts." (citations omitted). Here, the effect of Waldron's not guilty plea is to place in controversy Waldron's charged conduct. The location of the occurrence of the charged conduct was not in issue nor was the State obliged to prove any particular location. "Section 1105 prohibits expression of opinion only `upon issues of fact arising in the case.'" <italic>Id.</italic> Because location of the alleged charges was not such an issue, there was no violation of section 1105.

Contrary to Waldron's contention, the document in issue did not "lead the jurors down the guilty trail" in violation of his right to an impartial trial. Me. Const. art. I, ยง 6. Instead, the document was useful in assisting the jury in fulfilling its obligation to determine whether the State had met its burden of proof as to each of the multiple charges against Waldron. <italic>See</italic><italic>State v. Fournier,</italic> <cross_reference>554 A.2d 1184</cross_reference>, 1188, n. 7 (Me. 1989).
