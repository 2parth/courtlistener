<opinion_text>  MEMORANDUM OF DECISION.

Chester Quimby appeals the judgment convicting him of unlawful sexual contact under <cross_reference>17-A M.R.S.A. ยง 255</cross_reference>(1)(C) (Supp. 1988) entered pursuant to a jury verdict in the Superior Court (Penobscot County;<page_number>Page 1054</page_number><italic>Beaulieu, J.</italic>). He contends that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he touched the victim "for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire or for the purpose of causing bodily injury or offensive physical contact." <cross_reference>17-A M.R.S.A. ยง 251</cross_reference>(1)(D) (Supp. 1988). Our review of the evidence, however, persuades us that the jury could rationally find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <italic>State v. Lyons,</italic> <cross_reference>466 A.2d 868</cross_reference>, 870 (Me. 1983); <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Barry,</italic> <cross_reference>495 A.2d 825</cross_reference>, 826 (Me. 1985).

The entry is:

Judgment affirmed.

All concurring.
