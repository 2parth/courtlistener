From a conviction of driving to endanger, <cross_reference>29 M.R.S.A. ยง 1314</cross_reference>
(Supp. 1985), in a jury trial in Superior Court (Lincoln County) the Defendant, Paul Thompson, brings his appeal here, challenging only the sufficiency of the evidence of the incident that occurred September 1, 1984, on the Sawdust Hill Road, Nobleboro, to support that conviction.
