<opinion_byline>   PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   Upon the argument of this cause, defendants relied entirely upon their motion for judgment as of nonsuit, assigning as error his Honor's refusal to grant the same. Considering the evidence in its most favorable light for the plaintiff, the accepted position on such motion, we think the testimony was sufficient to be submitted to the jury, under authority of <italic>Ramsbottom</italic><italic>v. R. R.</italic>, <cross_reference>138 N.C. 38</cross_reference>.

No error.<page_number>Page 478</page_number>
