<syllabus>If a suggestion of death be made, and not entered by the clerk, and a  <italic>supersedeas</italic> be obtained and a writ of error moved for, an amendment may be permitted in the suggestion of the death, <italic>nunc pro tunc</italic>, to avoid the error, but it must be on payment of the costs of the <italic>supersedeas</italic> and writ of error.

</syllabus>
<posture>   EJECTMENT. Prior to the last term counsel for plaintiff suggested the death of one of the defendants, but the clerk failed to enter it. At the last term a trial was had, and a verdict for the plaintiff. In the vacation after this term an affidavit was made that one of the defendants had died before the trial, and that no suggestion of his death had been entered of record. A <italic>supersedeas</italic> was obtained and notice given that a writ of error would be moved for that cause. At this term plaintiff's counsel produced an affidavit of Mr. Taylor, who acted as deputy clerk at the time the suggestion was made, stating that it had been made, and that he was directed to enter it, but delayed the entry in order to consult his principal about the form, and it was afterwards forgotten.

And upon this affidavit the plaintiff's counsel moved for, and obtained, a rule to show cause why the suggestion should not be entered <italic>nunc pro</italic><italic>tunc</italic>, which, coming on to be argued, the plaintiff's counsel cited 5 Burr., 2731; Cowper, 408, and 5 Term, 577.<page_number>Page 186</page_number>

</posture><attorneys>   <italic>Mr. Norwood, for the defendant</italic>, insisted that if the amendment moved for should be granted, still the Court should order the plaintiff to pay the costs of the <italic>supersedeas</italic> and other proceedings preparatory to the writ of error.

<opinion_text>   The amendment moved for is within the principle of the cases cited, and, therefore, must be allowed. I am of the opinion, however, that as the plaintiff was put to costs by this omission, the defendant should pay the costs occasioned by it.

The defendant's counsel then moved that the cause should be referred to the Court of Conference.

<opinion_text>   It shall be carried to the Court of Conference if the counsel desire it.

(178)    Upon which the plaintiff's counsel produced an affidavit stating that the defendant was in declining circumstances, and praying that he be held to give security for the costs. The judge thought this reasonable, and directed such security to be given. The defendant declined giving the same, and the cause was not removed.
