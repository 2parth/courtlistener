<posture>    ON Certiorari to review judgments of Johnston, Judge, entered at the 8 May 1972 Session of ROWAN Superior Court.

</posture>
<opinion_text>    In separate warrants issued in Rowan District Court defendants were charged with assaulting a police officer while discharging a duty of his office. They were convicted in district court and from judgments imposed, they appealed to superior court. In superior court the cases were consolidated for trial, defendants pleaded not guilty, a jury found them guilty as charged and from judgments imposing prison sentences, they gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals. For good cause shown as to why they were unable to docket their appeal within the time provided by our rules, we allowed defendants' petition for certiorari.

<opinion_text>    After a careful review of the record on appeal, with particular reference to the questions raised in defendants' brief, we conclude that defendants received a fair trial free from prejudicial error.

No error.

Judges PARKER and VAUGHN concur.<page_number>Page 335</page_number>
