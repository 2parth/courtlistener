<center>                            <underline>CONCLUSIONS OF LAWS:</underline></center>
1. Under the provisions of the Tort Claims Act, negligence is determined by the same rules applicable to private parties. <italic>Bolkir v.</italic><italic>N.C. State University</italic>, <cross_reference>321 N.C. 706</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>709</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>365 S.E.2d 898</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>900</cross_reference> (1988).

2. N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>143-291</cross_reference>(a) confers the Industrial Commission with jurisdiction to hear tort claims against the State Board of Education, the Board of Transportation, and all other departments, institutions and agencies of the State.

3. A Motion to Dismiss upon the pleadings tests the legal sufficiency of Bunch's Affidavit. For the purpose of NCDOC's Motion to Dismiss, Bunch's allegations are treated as true. N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>1A-1</cross_reference>, Rule 12(b)(6).<page_number>Page 4</page_number>

4. Bunch's Affidavit and argument at hearing shows alleged violations of constitutional rights and intentional acts on the part of the NCDOC. Additionally, Bunch's allegations are not sufficient to establish negligence despite the use of the term "negligent" to describe NCDOC actions.

5. Intentional acts are not within the scope of the Tort Claims Act. See N.C. Gen Stat. ยง <cross_reference>143-291</cross_reference>. The Industrial Commission lacks jurisdiction over claims of intentional acts. Bunch failed to state a claim for negligence.
