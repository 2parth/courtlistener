<opinion_byline><center>              OPINION AND AWARD for the Full Commission by THOMAS J. BOLCH, Commissioner, and DISSENT by DIANNE C. SELLERS, Commissioner, N.C. Industrial Commission.</center></opinion_byline>
<posture>  The Full Commission reviewed this matter on June 4, 2002, upon appeal by defendant from an Opinion and Award by Deputy Commissioner W. Bain Jones, Jr., filed on June 29, 2001. The case was heard before Deputy Commissioner Jones in Plymouth, North Carolina, on February 14, 2001. Subsequent to the Deputy Commissioner's Opinion and Award, counsel for defendant failed by excusable neglect to file a timely notice of appeal to the Full Commission. Defendant's counsel then filed with the Commission a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals, assuming that defendant's opportunity to appeal to the Full Commission had expired. By Orders dated August 8 and August 20, 2001, Commissioner Thomas J. Bolch denied defendant's notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals and granted defendant leave by virtue of excusable neglect to appeal to the Full Commission, keeping with the usual procedure that appeals from Deputy Commissioner decisions go to the Full Commission as contemplated by the Workers' Compensation Act rather than directly to the Court of Appeals.

Plaintiff:       Wallace and Graham, Attorneys, Salisbury, North Carolina; Mona Lisa Wallace and Jill Calvert, appearing.

Defendant:       Teague, Campbell, Dennis and Gorham, Attorneys, Raleigh, North Carolina; Thomas M. Clare and Tracey Jones, appearing.

<opinion_text><center>                               ***********</center>
The Full Commission reviewed the prior Opinion and Award based upon the record of the proceedings before Deputy Commissioner Jones and the briefs and oral arguments before the Full Commission. The appealing party has not shown good ground to reconsider the evidence; receive further evidence; rehear the parties or their representatives; or amend the Opinion and Award, except for minor modifications. Accordingly, the Full Commission affirms the Opinion and Award of Deputy Commissioner Jones, with modifications.

<center>                               ***********</center>
The Full Commission finds as fact and concludes as matters of law the following, which were entered by the parties as:

<center>                              <underline>STIPULATIONS</underline></center>
1. The parties are subject to the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act, as defendant Weyerhaeuser Company employs the requisite number of employees to be bound under the provisions of the act.

2. Defendant is self insured.

3. Plaintiff was employed by defendant at its facility in Plymouth, North Carolina, from December 1, 1944, until December 1, 1945, and from December 21, 1946, until December 31, 1982.

4. Plaintiff was last injuriously exposed to asbestos during plaintiff's employment with defendant. Plaintiff was exposed to asbestos for thirty (30) days within a seven (7) month period, as set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>.

5. Defendant manufactures paper and paper products, including paper for crafts, bags, boxes, and pulp for baby diapers. The approximate size of defendant's plant in Plymouth, North Carolina, is 3/4 of a mile long. The entire facility is built on approximately 350 acres and encompasses about 20 different buildings. The newest building was built in the 1960s and the vast majority of the insulation used in the original construction of the buildings contained asbestos. Steam-producing boilers are used at the facility, along with hundreds of miles of steam pipes covered with asbestos insulation. The heat coming off the steam pipes is used, among other things, to dry the wet pulp/paper.

6. It was stipulated that plaintiff's income for the fifty-two (52) weeks prior to his retirement was $42,057.65.

7. Plaintiff contends that he is entitled to an award of a 10% penalty pursuant to the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-12</cross_reference>, and defendant stipulated that should the claim be found compensable, defendant would agree by compromise to pay an amount of 5% of all compensation, exclusive of medical compensation, as an award of penalty pursuant thereto.

8. Should N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference> be declared unconstitutional, plaintiff may offer additional testimony on the issues of loss of wage earning capacity and/or disability.

9. The transcript of Joseph Wendlick's testimony at civil trial, his curriculum vitae, and other documentation produced by defendant in discovery, has been stipulated into evidence as Stipulated Exhibit 1.

10. The relevant medical records of plaintiff, including documentation from Drs. Curseen, Dula, Bernstein, Grauel, and Lucas, have been stipulated into evidence as Stipulated Exhibit 1.

11. The employment and income records of plaintiff have been stipulated into evidence as Stipulated Exhibit 2.

12. Defendant stipulates that all the procedures used in Weyerhaeuser's asbestos medical surveillance program at its facility in Plymouth, North Carolina, were consistent with those outlined as part of the North Carolina Dusty Trades Program that is contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. §§<cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference>. Further, these procedures were in place during plaintiff's employment at the Plymouth facility.

13. Defendant stipulates that the medical monitoring procedures used in its asbestos medical surveillance program were the same in all Weyerhaeuser plants in the State of North Carolina.

14. Defendant stipulates that the Weyerhaeuser facilities that Mr. Joseph Wendlick referred to in his deposition transcript, which has been stipulated into evidence, included the facilities in North Carolina.

15. Plaintiff contends the contested issues before the Commission are:

<block_quote>  (a)  What benefits, monetary and/or medical, is plaintiff entitled to receive, if any, at this time?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (b)  Is plaintiff entitled to the additional panel examination(s) as provided by in N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61.3</cross_reference> <italic>et seq.</italic>, to determine what, if any, final compensation he may be due?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (c)  Whether plaintiff shall be entitled to attorney fees for the unreasonable defense of this matter?</block_quote>

16. Defendant contends the contested issues before the Commission are:

<block_quote>  (a)  What benefits, monetary and/or medical, is plaintiff entitled to receive, if any, at this time?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (b)  Does N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference>
apply to plaintiff's claim for benefits, and regardless, are these statutes in violation of the Constitutions of the United States and North Carolina?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (c)  Is plaintiff engaged in an occupation that has been found by the Industrial Commission to expose employees to the hazards of asbestosis under the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference>?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (d)  At the time of the diagnosis, was plaintiff subject to removal from an occupation that exposed plaintiff to the hazards of asbestosis, as contemplated by N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through  <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference>?</block_quote>

17. On April 24, 2001, defendant stipulated on the record during the beginning of the deposition of Dr. Dula that plaintiff does suffer from asbestosis, rendering Dr. Dula's testimony unnecessary. Defendant agreed to stipulate that plaintiff has asbestosis after reviewing the deposition transcript of the Advisory Medical Panel Physician. Thus, this issue is no longer contested.

<center>                               ***********</center><center>                           <underline>EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</underline></center>
The objections raised in the depositions of Linda Curtin Anderson, M.D., and Albert F. Curseen, M.D., are overruled.

<center>                               ***********</center>
Based upon all of the competent evidence of record and reasonable inferences flowing therefrom, the Full Commission makes the following:

<center>                            <underline>FINDINGS OF FACT</underline></center>
1. Plaintiff was an employee with defendant at its Plymouth, North Carolina, facility from December 1, 1944, until December 1, 1945, and from December 21, 1946, until December 31, 1982.

2. Plaintiff was exposed to asbestos dust while working in the boiler room and paper machine areas at defendant's facility in Plymouth, North Carolina. During his first year of employment, plaintiff worked with the bull gang in the boiler room. The inside and outside of the boilers and all of the piping in the room were covered with friable asbestos-containing insulation. Plaintiff was most heavily exposed to asbestos when he worked inside the boilers. Plaintiff spent the rest of his career working on the paper machines, where he was exposed to asbestos from the brake dust on the winders and brake shoes. Additionally, plaintiff was exposed to asbestos when he replaced the asbestos-containing dryer felts on the paper machines. Plaintiff poured asbestos directly into the pulp vats to get the map paper to fold better. This asbestos dust would cause the entire area to get foggy. Defendant did not provide plaintiff with a respirator to protect him from asbestos exposure.

3. Plaintiff was exposed to asbestos-containing materials on a regular basis for more than thirty days or parts thereof inside of seven consecutive months from 1944 until 1982.

4. Albert Curseen, M.D., diagnosed plaintiff with asbestosis on September 1, 1999. Dr. Curseen's diagnosis was based upon plaintiff's history of asbestos exposure and adequate latency period, his chest radiograph, clubbing of the fingernails, and history of dyspnea on exertion. Dr. Curseen additionally saw plaintiff on June5, 2000, for continued monitoring of his asbestosis. Further, Dr. Curseen confirmed plaintiff's diagnosis of asbestosis during his live deposition on March 6, 2000.

5. Linda Anderson, M.D., performed the advisory medical evaluation and determined that plaintiff had a history of exposure to asbestos and noted radiographic changes consistent with asbestosis after reviewing plaintiff's chest x-ray and high-resolution CT scan. During Dr. Anderson's live deposition on March 30, 2001, she opined that plaintiff's x-ray findings and significant history of exposure are consistent with asbestosis. She additionally recommended yearly chest x-rays and pulmonary function studies to medically monitor plaintiff.

6. Phillip Lucas, M.D., interpreted a chest x-ray dated August 28, 1999, and determined there were bilateral interstitial fibrotic changes consistent with asbestosis in a patient who had an adequate exposure history and latency period. Dr. Lucas confirmed these findings during his live deposition on April 10, 2001.

7. Richard Bernstein, M.D., interpreted a chest x-ray dated August 28, 1999, and determined there were parenchymal and pleural abnormalities present consistent with pneumoconiosis of asbestosis. During his live deposition on April 9, 2001, Dr. Bernstein testified these radiographic findings are consistent with asbestosis given an appropriate exposure history and latency period.

8. Fred Dula, M.D., interpreted a CT scan and chest x-ray dated April 21, 2000, and a chest x-ray dated November 13, 1998, and determined there were interstitial and pleural changes in plaintiff's lung bases consistent with asbestosis.

9. George Grauel, M.D., interpreted a chest x-ray dated August 28, 1999, and identified within the lower lung zones a fine to medium irregular opacity pattern that may be associated with an underlying pneumoconiosis such as asbestosis. He also identified en profile pleural plaques that may be related to an underlying pneumoconiosis such as asbestosis.

10. Plaintiff developed asbestosis as a result of his employment with defendant, which placed him at an increased risk of developing asbestos as compared to members of the general public.

11. Plaintiff also suffers from asbestos-related pleural disease and his employment with defendant placed him at an increased risk of developing the disease as compared to members of the general public.

12. Plaintiff was last injuriously exposed to asbestos while employed by defendant and developed the occupational diseases of asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease as a result of his many years of exposure to asbestos at defendant's facility.

13. Plaintiff's pulmonary impairment is permanent and is likely to progress. Plaintiff would benefit from medical monitoring, evaluation and some treatment in the future as a result of his asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease. Further, the medical monitoring is reasonably necessary due to his increased risk of developing lung and other asbestos-related cancers.

14. Plaintiff would benefit from medical monitoring, evaluation, and some treatment in the future for his asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease.

15. Defendant's Plymouth facility was found to have high levels of friable asbestos dust by their own Industrial Hygienist, Joseph Wendlick. As a result of Mr. Wendlick's findings, an asbestos medical monitoring program was initiated to comply with the dusty trade provisions of the N.C.G.S. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference>.

16. Defendant, in lieu of participating in the North Carolina Dusty Trades Program as contained in N.C. Gen Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference>, implemented its own asbestos medical surveillance program, which it asserts was consistent with the dusty trades statutory provisions. Defendant convinced the State of North Carolina that defendant need not be included in the state Dusty Trades Program since defendant's asbestos medical surveillance program served the same purpose. If defendant's medical surveillance program was in place during plaintiff's employment with defendant, then it is likely that plaintiff would have participated in the program by virtue of his employment with defendant.

17. Plaintiff may have relied upon defendant's representations to him and to his fellow employees that defendant's asbestos medical surveillance program would monitor his exposure to asbestos and would medically screen and monitor him for any signs of the development of asbestosis. In accordance with such program, plaintiff would have been seen by defendant's doctors on occasions throughout his employment with defendant, raising the possibility of discovery of plaintiff's asbestosis while he was still employed by defendant.

18. Plaintiff was likely not aware of his development of asbestosis until after he retired because defendant's medical surveillance program did not effectively monitor and track his development of asbestosis during his employment with defendant, that had defendant's program provided proper medical screening to inform plaintiff of his development of asbestosis, he would have been diagnosed with asbestosis while still in defendant's employ and thus subject to an order of removal and subsequent award. If plaintiff, to his detriment, relied upon the false representations of defendant in regard to its medical monitoring of plaintiff, then defendant may be equitably estopped from arguing that plaintiff is not entitled to the 104 week award pursuant to an order of removal. Additional evidence as to the elements of equitable estoppel would be required for the Commission to make a determination on the matter.

19. N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>97-61.7</cross_reference> are constitutional.

<center>                               ***********</center>
Based upon the foregoing stipulations and findings of fact, the Full Commission reaches the following:

<center>                           <underline>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</underline></center>
1. Plaintiff contracted the occupational diseases of asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease as a result of his employment with defendant. N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-53</cross_reference>(24) and <cross_reference>97-62</cross_reference>.

2. Plaintiff was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of asbestos dust while employed by defendant, and for as much as 30 days or parts thereof, within seven consecutive months, which exposure proximately augmented his asbestosis. N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>; <italic>Clark v. ITT</italic><italic>Grinnell Industrial Piping, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. 417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>539 S.E.2d 369</cross_reference>
(2000); <italic>Haynes v. Feldspar Producing Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>222 N.C. 163</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>22 S.E.2d 275</cross_reference>
(1942); <italic>Barber v. Babcock  Wilcox Construction Company</italic>,<cross_reference>101 N.C. App. 564</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>400 S.E.2d 735</cross_reference> (1991).

3. The provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-60</cross_reference> <italic>et seq.</italic> are constitutional.

4. N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference> provides in pertinent part that following a first hearing determination by the Industrial Commission that a claimant has asbestosis, based upon either medical evidence or by agreement of the parties, the Commission "shall by order remove the employee from any occupation which exposes him to the hazards of asbestosis . . ." and that upon removal the employee shall be entitled to "weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of his average weekly wages . . . which compensation shall continue for a period of 104 weeks."

5. The North Carolina Supreme Court determined that a retiree who is no longer employed by the asbestos-exposing industry is not entitled to an order of removal and the subsequent award because he no longer faces the possibility of exposure. <italic>See Austin v. General Tire,</italic> <cross_reference>354 N.C. 344</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>553 S.E.2d 680</cross_reference> (2001). However, the instant case may be distinguishable from <italic>Austin</italic> in that plaintiff was likely not aware of his development of asbestosis until after he retired because defendant's medical surveillance program did not effectively monitor and track his development of asbestosis during his employment with defendant. Had defendant's program provided proper medical screening to inform plaintiff of his development of asbestosis, he might have been diagnosed with asbestosis while still in defendant's employ and, thus, subject to an order of removal and subsequent award. Plaintiff may have, to his detriment, relied upon the representations of defendant in regard to its medical monitoring of plaintiff. Thus, defendant may be equitably estopped from arguing that plaintiff is not entitled to the 104 week award pursuant to an order of removal.

The doctrine of equitable estoppel is a means of preventing a party from asserting a defense that is inconsistent with its prior conduct.<italic>Purser v. Heatherlin Properties</italic>, <cross_reference>137 N.C. App. 332</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>337</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>527 S.E.2d 689</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>692</cross_reference> (2000), cert. denied, <cross_reference>352 N.C. 676</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>545 S.E.2d 428</cross_reference> (2000) (citing<italic>Godley v. County of Pitt</italic>, <cross_reference>306 N.C. 357</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>360</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>293 S.E.2d 167</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>169</cross_reference>
(1982)). In particular, the rule is grounded in the premise that `it offends every principle of equity and morality to permit a party to enjoy the benefits of a transaction and at the same time deny its terms or qualifications.' <italic>Id.</italic> (quoting <italic>Thompson v. Soles,</italic> <cross_reference>299 N.C. 484</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>487</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>263 S.E.2d 599</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>602</cross_reference> (1980)). The law of estoppel applies in workers' compensation cases, and may be used to ensure coverage of a work-related injury. <italic>Id.</italic> (citing <italic>Carroll v. Daniels and Daniels Constr. Co.</italic>, <italic>Inc.</italic>,<cross_reference>327 N.C. 616</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>620</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>398 S.E.2d 325</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>328</cross_reference> (1990).

Defendant's argument to the effect that estoppel was raised too late in this case is to no avail. In <italic>Purser v. Heatherlin Properties, supra,</italic> the doctrine was raised for the first time by the Court of Appeals itself <italic>ex</italic><italic>meru moto</italic>.

In <italic>Belfield v. Weyerhaeuser Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>77 N.C. App. 332</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>335 S.E.2d 44</cross_reference>
(1985), the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that equitable estoppel was appropriate to prevent an employer from raising a time limitation when the employer misrepresented to the employee that his rights under the Workers' Compensation Act were being exercised on his behalf by the employer. <italic>See Id.</italic> at 337, 47. The court stated:

<block_quote>  The commonest type of case is that in which a claimant, typically not highly educated, contends that he was lulled into a sense of security by statements of employer or carrier representatives that `he will be taken care of' or that his claim has been filed for him or that a claim will not be necessary because he would be paid compensation benefits in any event. When such facts are established by the evidence, the lateness of the claim has ordinarily been excused.</block_quote>

<italic>Id.</italic> (quoting 3 A. Larson, The Law of Workmen's Compensation, Section 78.45 at 15-302 through 15-305 (1983)). In the case before the Commission, defendant similarly seeks to argue that the 104 week award pursuant to an order of removal is not timely because plaintiff was not diagnosed until after he retired. However, this Commission will not permit defendant to use a time limitation defense if there is evidence suggesting that defendant's own medical surveillance program failed to detect plaintiff's development of asbestosis while he was still in defendant's employ, or failed to disclose to plaintiff that he had developed asbestosis when defendant had knowledge thereof. Such acts may inequitably prevent plaintiff from receiving an order of removal and subsequent award that he otherwise deserved. For these reasons, defendant may be equitably estopped from arguing as to the timeliness of plaintiff's order or removal and subsequent award. Evidence as to the elements of estoppel is required before the Commission can make a determination on the matter. Therefore, this issue must be held in abeyance pending the presentation of such evidence.

6. Plaintiff is entitled to payment of all medical expenses incurred or to be incurred as a result of his asbestosis and asbestos related pleural disease for so long as such examinations, evaluations and treatments tend to affect a cure, give relief or lessen his disability. N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-25</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>97-59</cross_reference>.

7. Plaintiff is entitled to undergo subsequent examinations as provided by law, pursuant to the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ <cross_reference>97-61.1</cross_reference> <italic>et</italic><italic>seq.</italic> and is further entitled to any additional benefits due to plaintiff which shall be determined after additional examinations and hearings.

8. Plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees from defendant on the ground that defendant unreasonably defended this claim pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-88.1</cross_reference> is hereby held in abeyance until the final award is issued in this claim.

9. This claim must be remanded to a deputy commissioner for further hearing on the issue of estoppel, and for further hearing (if necessary) following subsequent examinations as required under N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61</cross_reference> <italic>et seq.</italic> Plaintiff's eligibility for further compensation in addition to medical and any other issues in controversy are hereby held in abeyance pending the outcome of further hearings.

<center>                               ***********</center>
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the undersigned enters the following:

<center>                                  <underline>AWARD</underline></center>
1. Defendant shall pay all medical expenses incurred or to be incurred by plaintiff as a result of her asbestosis and asbestos related pleural disease for so long as such examinations, evaluations and treatments tend to affect a cure, give relief or lessen her disability.

2. Plaintiff shall undergo additional examinations as provided by law.

3. The Commission hereby retains jurisdiction in this matter to address the issue of permanent impairment, as plaintiff has not undergone the additional panel examination as required by law for such determination. Upon completion of such examinations, should the parties be unable to agree on what additional compensation, if any, is due, the parties may request a hearing before this Commission on this matter.

4. The Commission additionally retains jurisdiction in this matter to address the issue of equitable estoppel, as raised by plaintiff, as a means of awarding to plaintiff the 104 week award pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>.

5. Defendant shall pay the costs of this proceeding.

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>  For the reasons stated below, I respectfully disagree with the majority decision to remand this case to reconsider an order of removal and payment of 104 weeks of benefits under an estoppel theory.

<center>            <underline>NECESSARY ELEMENTS FOR ORDER OF REMOVAL/104 WEEKS</underline></center>
Removal from employment under § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference> requires a finding of at least two conditions: (1) that the plaintiff has a compensable claim for asbestosis; and (2) that plaintiff is <italic>currently</italic> employed (at the time of the "hearing after first [panel] examination") in a position that causes harmful exposure to asbestos. <italic>See Austin v. Continental General Tire</italic>,<cross_reference>141 N.C. App. 397</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>415</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>540 S.E.2d 824</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>835</cross_reference> (2000) (J. Greene, dissenting), <italic>reversed and adopting dissenting opinion</italic>, <cross_reference>354 N.C. 344</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>553 S.E.2d 680</cross_reference> (2001); <italic>Moore v. Standard Mineral Company</italic>,<cross_reference>122 N.C. App. 375</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>469 S.E.2d 594</cross_reference> (1996). On the issue of removal, §<cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) specifically provides:

<block_quote>  "If the Industrial Commission finds at the first hearing that the employee has asbestosis or if the parties enter into an agreement to the fact that the employee has asbestosis, it shall by order <bold><italic>remove</italic></bold> the employee  <bold><italic>from any occupation which exposes him to the hazards of</italic></bold> <bold><italic>asbestosis</italic></bold>"</block_quote>

[Emphasis added] Although the parties have stipulated that plaintiff has asbestosis, plaintiff has not met the second condition, and indeed has presented no evidence to prove that his occupation <italic>currently</italic> exposes him "to the hazards of asbestosis." Moreover, the evidence is that plaintiff retired from his employment with defendant in 1982. Thus, plaintiff has not established that he is entitled to an order of removal. Further, only an appropriate order of removal, that actually removes plaintiff from his<italic>current</italic> employment in the industry, triggers the payment of 104 weeks of benefits. <italic>See Clark v. ITT Grinnell</italic>, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. 417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>539 S.E.2d 369</cross_reference>,<italic>remanded for reconsideration,</italic> <cross_reference>354 N.C. 572</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>558 S.E.2d 867</cross_reference> (2002);<italic>Austin</italic>, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 415</cross_reference>; <italic>Moore</italic>, <italic>supra</italic> (removal from industry by directive of Commission); N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) (if employee is removed from industry).

The application of the statutory provision regarding removal and subsequent payment of 104 weeks has a practical purpose and historical significance. By way of an explanation, employees in a dusty trade are entitled to a dusty trade card only after passing a chest x-ray examination, and for as long as their yearly chest x-rays remain clear. Upon a finding of asbestosis after clinical examination (the first panel examination), the employee's dusty trade card is revoked, prohibiting his continued employment in the dusty trade industry. The diagnosis of asbestosis and evidence of <italic>current</italic> hazardous exposure to asbestos thereby trigger an order of removal and the second and third panel examinations during which time the 104 weeks of benefits is paid. The length of the 104-week period is significant in the statutory scheme of the panel examinations. A 52-week period exists between the first and second panel examinations and another 52-week period exists between the second and third panel examinations. This accounts for the 104 weeks of benefits which are provided as a "safety net" for an employee who is suddenly prohibited from further employment in the dusty trade industry where the employee is <italic>currently</italic> hazardously exposed and whose final disability determination will not be made until after the third panel examination. Although § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference> has now been extended by the courts to non-dusty trade employment, the same principles apply. The 104 weeks of benefits is intended to compensate the employee who suddenly is prohibited from continuing in his <italic>current</italic> employment because it exposes him to the hazards of asbestos. Thus, evidence of plaintiff's <italic>current</italic> exposure to the hazards of asbestos is a critical element to be established <bold>prior</bold> to an order of removal and payment of 104 weeks of benefits.

Plaintiff has the burden of proof on the issue of <italic>current</italic> exposure to the hazards of asbestos. While plaintiff is not required to provide scientific proof of his <italic>current</italic> exposure to asbestos for purposes of § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b), nevertheless he must prove <italic>current</italic> exposure by the greater weight of the competent evidence. <italic>See Austin</italic>,<cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 404</cross_reference>. The <italic>Austin</italic> Court did not hold, as plaintiff suggests in this case, that plaintiff is entitled to removal without establishing that he is <italic>currently</italic> exposed to the hazards of asbestos; that is that he is employed in an industry that actually exposes him to the hazards of asbestos. Further, § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) compels removal from "hazardous exposure" to asbestos, not merely because a facility may have asbestos present, but because asbestos is present in such a form as it can be inhaled, i.e. friable. Asbestos that is non-friable, encapsulated, or in other form such that it would not be inhaled and therefore not cause or contribute to asbestosis is not, while in that form, a "hazardous" exposure. Thus, plaintiff must present evidence that there is asbestos in the facility that <italic>currently</italic> presents a hazardous exposure to him while working. <italic>See Austin</italic>, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 415</cross_reference>.

Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that his employment with defendant <italic>currently</italic> exposes him to the hazards of asbestos. The parties stipulated that plaintiff last worked for defendant on December 31, 1982. Plaintiff was 55 at the time of his retirement in 1982. The undisputed evidence is that plaintiff retired in 1982, almost 19 years before the "hearing after first examination."<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Thus, there is no evidence that plaintiff is <italic>currently</italic> employed with defendant, let alone that the employment is <italic>currently</italic> hazardous. The majority finds in Finding of Fact No. 3, "[p]laintiff was exposed to asbestos-containing materials on a regular basis for more than thirty days or parts thereof, within seven consecutive months from 1944 to 1982." However, there is no evidence, stipulation, or reasonable inference to support the finding that plaintiff is <italic>currently</italic>, hazardously exposed to asbestos in employment with defendant.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The majority correctly finds in Finding of Fact Nos. 1 and 4 that plaintiff was last employed on December 31, 1982 and that he was not diagnosed with asbestosis until September 1, 1999. The parties also stipulated that plaintiff was last injuriously exposed (30 work days inside of seven consecutive months) to asbestos while employed by defendant. These findings and stipulation taken together, however, do not support the necessary element under §<cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) to establish that plaintiff at the present time is hazardously exposed in his employment with defendant. The stipulation does not define when during the twenty-some years of employment plaintiff was last exposed to the hazards of asbestos, and more significantly, does not state that plaintiff is <italic>currently</italic> exposed to the hazards of asbestos. Thus, there is no evidence to support an essential element of plaintiff's claim under § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b).

<center>                <underline>PLAINTIFF'S § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> ARGUMENT IS MISPLACED</underline></center>
Rather than presenting evidence of <italic>current</italic> exposure to the hazards of asbestos in her employment, plaintiff suggests that the stipulation, made pursuant to § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>, that plaintiff was exposed to asbestos for 30 days within a seven-month period,<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> presents an irrebuttable presumption that plaintiff was exposed to asbestos in the last 30 days of his employment. Plaintiff's reliance on § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> to determine <italic>current</italic>
exposure is misplaced because § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> is not applicable for determining <italic>current</italic> exposure. Section <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> determines liability for "last injurious exposure" when there is a series of defendants, all of whom are potentially liable because their employment caused plaintiff to be exposed to the hazards of asbestos. Defendant's stipulation to "last injurious exposure" merely indicates that, should plaintiff successfully establish a compensable claim for § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) benefits, then defendant is the liable employer. Section <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> does not abrogate plaintiff's burden to prove the elements of his case, including but not limited to, the elements for removal and the award of 104 weeks under § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b).

Plaintiff's argument arises from a misinterpretation of the Court of Appeals' decision in <italic>Barber v. Babcock  Wilcox Construction Company</italic>,<cross_reference>101 N.C. App. 564</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>400 S.E.2d 735</cross_reference> (1991) and the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision in <italic>Fetner v. Rocky Mount Marble  Granite Works</italic>,<cross_reference>251 N.C. 296</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>111 S.E.2d 324</cross_reference> (1959). Both of these cases deal with the issue of "last injurious exposure" for purposes of determining the particular defendant liable for benefits. Plaintiff misapplies § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>
to abrogate plaintiff's burden of proof with regard to <italic>current</italic> exposure when § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> is only applicable after plaintiff has carried all of the threshold burdens of proof for compensability of his disease. Section<cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>, in and of itself, does not remove plaintiff's burden to prove a necessary element of his § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) claim; i.e.: <italic>current</italic> exposure to the hazards of asbestos. Furthermore, as these cases dealt with dusty trade defendants whose facilities continued to cause <italic>current</italic> exposure, whether there was "current exposure" was not an issue in controversy and therefore not a litigated issue in these cases.

Plaintiff has misinterpreted the <italic>Barber</italic> decision. Plaintiff, out of context, quotes <italic>Barber</italic> to find that § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> "creates an irrebuttable legal presumption that the last 30 days of work is a period of last injurious exposure." <italic>See Barber</italic> <cross_reference>101 N.C. App. at 565</cross_reference>. The issue in<italic>Barber</italic> was whether plaintiff who was only employed for forty-eight days at the second of two employers nevertheless had to establish that his exposure to asbestos was "injurious." The Court of Appeals correctly applied § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> and explained "[i]n light of the irrebuttable legal presumption that the last thirty days of work subjecting the plaintiff to the hazards of asbestos is the period of <italic>last injurious exposure</italic> and the Commission's holding that plaintiff was exposed to the inhalation during the forty-eight days he worked for the defendant, such exposure must be deemed injurious." <italic>Id.</italic> at 566 [emphasis added]. However, contrary to plaintiff's argument in the instant case, the Court of Appeals in <italic>Barber</italic>
did <bold><italic>not</italic></bold> find that a plaintiff did not have to establish <italic>current</italic> exposure to asbestos for purposes of removal; rather, the Court of Appeals explained that the plaintiff did not have to prove that his exposure to asbestos was "injurious" because § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> creates a presumption that 30 days of exposure within seven months is "injurious." <italic>Id.</italic> at 566. Further, the Court in <italic>Barber</italic> did not find evidence of exposure in the last 30 days of employment based on a <italic>presumption</italic>. In fact, the <italic>Barber</italic>
court had evidence of record to determine that plaintiff was exposed to asbestos during the forty-eight days that he worked for defendant. <italic>Id.</italic>

Similarly, the Supreme Court's decision in <italic>Fetner</italic> does not support plaintiff's argument that a stipulation of "last injurious exposure" is equivalent to a stipulation of <italic>current</italic> exposure. <italic>See</italic> <italic>Fetner v. Rocky</italic><italic>Mount Marble  Granite Works</italic>, <cross_reference>251 N.C. 296</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>111 S.E.2d 324</cross_reference> (1959). In<italic>Fetner</italic>, a dusty trades case, the issue was whether the exposure with a third employer for whom plaintiff only worked for eleven months was "injurious" when plaintiff was diagnosed with silicosis before he went to work for the third employer. In this case, plaintiff was diagnosed with silicosis on March 4, 1949, when he was working for the first employer, and his dusty trade card was revoked after his diagnosis. On August 10, 1950, plaintiff requested permission from the Industrial Commission to waive compensation and to go to work for the second employer. Plaintiff worked for the second employer from July 26, 1950 to October 19, 1950. Plaintiff then went to work for a third employer from November 4, 1950 to September 29, 1951. No waiver of compensation was sought for plaintiff's employment with the third employer, thereby raising the issue of whether the eleven-month employment with the third employer was "injurious" in light of the prior diagnosis of silicosis and prior revocation of plaintiff's dusty trade card based on that diagnosis. In examining the liability of the third employer, the Supreme Court held that the Commission may not arbitrarily select any thirty-day period of employment, but must select the last 30 days within a seven-month period during which the plaintiff was last exposed, as the period of "last injurious exposure." <italic>Fetner</italic>, <cross_reference>251 N.C. at 301</cross_reference>. Moreover, the Supreme Court did not relieve plaintiff of the burden to present evidence on the period of hazardous exposure. <italic>Id.</italic> Competent evidence was presented and findings were made to determine when plaintiff was last exposed to the hazards of silica.

Contrary to the suggestion of plaintiff, the <italic>Fetner</italic> and <italic>Barber</italic>
decisions do not abrogate the requirement of plaintiff to establish by the greater weight of the competent evidence the period of hazardous exposure. Rather, these decisions hold that § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> creates for purposes of liability among two or more defendants, where plaintiff proved hazardous exposure, an irrebuttable presumption that exposure for at least 30 days during a seven-month period is an "injurious exposure." In light of the stipulation of the parties and the lack of evidence of other hazardous employment, this issue is not present in this case; the defendant has stipulated that plaintiff's "injurious exposure" occurred during his employment with defendant.

Further, the plaintiff's illogical argument that the last thirty days of employment was injurious, without producing evidence of exposure to any asbestos during this thirty-day period, directly violates the Supreme Court's holding in <italic>Fetner</italic> that the Commission may "not arbitrarily select any thirty days of employment." <italic>Fetner</italic>, <cross_reference>251 N.C. at 300</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>111 S.E.2d at 327</cross_reference>. The relevant period under § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference> is the "last thirty days of employment <bold><italic>while exposed to silica</italic></bold> [asbestos] <bold><italic>dust</italic></bold>." <italic>Fetner</italic>,<cross_reference>251 N.C. at 300</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>111 S.E.2d at 327</cross_reference>. Without evidence of <italic>current</italic> exposure to asbestos, the Commission cannot find that plaintiff has met the second element of his claim, entitling him to an order of removal, which when accomplished triggers the award of 104 weeks of benefits. <italic>See Austin</italic>,<cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 145</cross_reference>; N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b).

Further, the <italic>Barber</italic> and <italic>Fetner</italic> cases were only in litigation due to the apparent inequity resulting from the strict application of § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>
designating liability on the last hazardous employment and did not arise from any disagreement concerning "current exposure." For example, liability must be placed on the last employer where the plaintiff has been exposed to the hazards of asbestos for as little as 30 days even when a prior employer may have hazardously exposed plaintiff to asbestos for more than twenty years. However, an employer who escapes liability in one case despite long exposure may be the last, short-term employer in the next case. Thus, taken from a broad view, the statute is equitable, and is consistent with the goal of the Legislature to promote judicial economy. <italic>See</italic> N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>.

<center>                       <underline>REMOVAL FROM HAZARDOUS WORK</underline></center>
Plaintiff asks the Commission to remove plaintiff from employment with defendant when plaintiff is not currently employed with defendant and there is no competent evidence that employment would <italic>currently</italic> subject plaintiff, or others who actually work there, to the hazards of asbestos. An order of removal, which is a prerequisite to § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) award of 104 weeks of benefits, is a legal nullity unless the plaintiff is actually working in an employment that creates a hazardous exposure to asbestos. Only an appropriate order of removal, that actually removes plaintiff from his <italic>current</italic> employment in the industry, triggers the payment of 104 weeks of benefits. <italic>See Clark v. ITT Grinnell</italic>,<cross_reference>141 N.C. App. 417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>539 S.E.2d 369</cross_reference>, <italic>remanded for reconsideration,</italic><cross_reference>354 N.C. 572</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>558 S.E.2d 867</cross_reference> (2002); <italic>Austin</italic>, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 415</cross_reference>;<italic>Moore</italic>, <italic>supra</italic> (removal from industry by directive of Commission); N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) (if employee is removed from industry).

The question of <italic>current</italic> exposure to asbestos as a condition precedent to the award of 104 weeks of benefits was recently addressed by the Court of Appeals in Abernathy<italic>. See Abernathy v. Sandoz Chemical</italic>,<cross_reference>151 N.C. App. 252</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>565 S.E.2d 218</cross_reference>, <italic>review denied</italic>, <cross_reference>356 N.C. 432</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>572 S.E.2d 421</cross_reference> (2002). In <italic>Abernathy</italic>, the plaintiff was represented by the same firm who represents plaintiff in this case. The Court of Appeals' opinion notes that the parties agreed that the Commission's award of 104 weeks of benefits was in error when the employee had retired and thereby was not <italic>currently</italic> engaged in employment that exposed him to the hazards of asbestos. Despite this concession before the Court of Appeals, plaintiff has not abandoned this argument before the Industrial Commission in this case, and insists that employees who are retired (such as the instant case), as well as those who are currently employed in positions where there is no evidence of <italic>current</italic> exposure to the hazards of asbestos, are entitled to removal and the 104 weeks of benefits. Further, plaintiff argues before the Commission that <italic>Austin</italic> does not require plaintiff to prove <italic>current</italic> exposure to the hazards of asbestos; however, Judge Greene's dissenting opinion, adopted by the Supreme Court, clearly states:

<block_quote>  "An employee who is no longer employed in a position that causes harmful exposure need not be `removed' from his employment."<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

<italic>Austin</italic>, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 415</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>540 S.E.2d at 835</cross_reference>. Judge Greene's statement is consistent with the express language of the Act requiring the Commission to order removal from "any occupation that exposes him to the hazards of asbestos". If the employee is not exposed to the hazards of asbestos, there is no hazardous employment from which to order the removal and the order of removal would be a legal nullity and, hence, could not trigger an award for 104 weeks of compensation.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

To trigger the award of 104 weeks of benefits the order of removal must cause plaintiff to be removed from the industry. In <italic>Moore</italic>, the court stated:

<block_quote>  "the language regarding `removal from the industry' has specific application only to occasions when   identified victims of occupational disease  are thereafter `removed' from a hazardous industry by directive of the Commission."</block_quote>

<italic>Clark</italic>, <cross_reference>539 S.E.2d at 376</cross_reference>, <italic>citing</italic>, <italic>Moore</italic>, <cross_reference>469 S.E.2d at 596</cross_reference>. The remand by the majority herein to consider an order of removal ignores the statutory mandate that plaintiff is to be actually removed from his employment with defendant.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> At best, an order of removal would be a legal nullity because there is no evidence that plaintiff is employed at all, let alone in an occupation that further exposes him to the hazards of asbestos. Moreover, since the order of "removal" cannot, and will not, in fact, remove plaintiff from his employment, let alone the industry, as plaintiff left employment before any directive of the Commission, a subsequent order of removal will not trigger the award of 104 weeks of benefits. <italic>Moore</italic>, <cross_reference>469 S.E.2d at 596</cross_reference>; Austin, <cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 415</cross_reference>; Abernathy<italic>, supra</italic>; N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b).

The statutory mandate is for the Commission to determine "removal" and the award of 104 weeks of benefits at the "first hearing" after the panel examination. N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>. If plaintiff, as in this case, is not employed in a position that causes harmful exposure at the time the Full Commission hold the "hearing after first [panel] examination," the removal and benefit provisions of § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) are not applicable. <italic>See Abernathy,</italic> <cross_reference>565 S.E.2d at 257</cross_reference>; <italic>Austin,</italic><cross_reference>540 S.E.2d at 835-36</cross_reference>; N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>. The benefits are for removal from "hazardous industry by a directive of the Commission."<italic>Clark</italic>, <cross_reference>539 S.E.2d at 376</cross_reference>, <italic>citing</italic>, <italic>Moore</italic>, <cross_reference>469 S.E.2d at 596</cross_reference>.

<center>                <underline>NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL</underline></center>
Findings of Fact Nos. 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the majority's opinion are not supported in the record of evidence before the Commission. In addition, these findings are <italic>conditional</italic> findings based on assumptions not supported by the evidence. These "findings" come solely from the argument of counsel. Plaintiff, in the instant case, did not testify that he relied upon representations to him that defendant's surveillance program was equal to the State's Dusty Trade monitoring program. Second, there is no evidence that defendant was or would have been declared a "dusty trade." And finally, there is no evidence to suggest that plaintiff would have been diagnosed sooner if he had been in the dusty trades monitoring program. Thus, there is no reason to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel in this case.

<center>                 <bold>A. No Evidence of Reliance by Plaintiff</bold></center>
A major assumption in the majority's findings is that plaintiff relied upon representations that defendant's surveillance program was equal to the State's Dusty Trade Program. There is no evidence of record that defendant represented to plaintiff, at relevant times while he was employed by defendant, that its monitoring program was equivalent to the State's program. Moreover, there is no evidence that plaintiff relied on such a representation. And finally, there is no evidence that Defendant's monitoring program was not equal to the State's Dusty Trades Program. Thus, there is no evidentiary foundation to consider an equitable estoppel theory.

<center>      <bold>B. No Evidence Defendants Convinced the State That It Should</bold> <bold>Not Be Designated as a Dusty Trade</bold></center>
A major assumption in plaintiff's argument, and the majority's findings, is that defendant's voluntary medical monitoring program excluded its employees from coverage in the State's mandatory "dusty trades" medical monitoring program.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> The evidence, however, does not support the conclusion that Weyerhaeuser's implementation of a monitoring program caused Weyerhaeuser to be excluded from the dusty trades monitoring program.

On this issue, plaintiff submitted the testimony of William H. Stephenson, which was taken in I.C. No. 902274 and is included in the stipulated exhibits in this action. Mr. Stephenson is the former Chairman of the Industrial Commission who has held numerous positions with this agency from 1948 through 1990, and subsequently has served on the advisory board of this agency. Mr. Stephenson explained that the Industrial Commission originally administered the dusty trade program until 1943 when the industrial hygienist at the Commission, and the program, was transferred to the State Board of Health. Mr. Stephenson explained that the State Board of Health would notify the Industrial Commission that a particular employer employed persons in a hazardous environment that exposes them to the hazards of asbestos and/or silica and that the Industrial Commission could then declare the employer to be a "dusty trade" subject the dusty trades monitoring program.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> The Industrial Commission relied on the State Board of Health to determine the industries and employers that were subject to this program. The Industrial Commission has never been designated Weyerhaeuser a dusty trade and this determination is made by the Commission, upon the advice of the State Department of Health, not the employer.

Mr. Stephenson testified that Weyerhaeuser did not fail to perform any obligation that they had under the Act. To the contrary, Weyerhaeuser did more than the State required by adopting its own monitoring program and submitting chest x-rays to the State for review. The State Department of Health was clearly aware of Weyerhaeuser's circumstance through the review of the chest x-rays, however, the Department of Health never requested the Industrial Commission to add Weyerhaeuser to the Dusty Trade list. There is no evidence that the voluntary acts of Weyerhaeuser of monitoring its employees and submitting their x-rays for review by the State Board of Health precluded the Industrial Commission from declaring Weyerhaeuser a "dusty trade" or that defendant otherwise "convinced" the State that it did not have to be subject to this regulation.

<center>        <bold>C. No Evidence that State Dusty Trade Program would have</bold> <bold>protected Plaintiff</bold></center>
The evidence does not support a conclusion that if plaintiff was in the State Dusty Trades monitoring program, then he would have been removed from work prior to his voluntary retirement in 1982. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that plaintiff exhibited signs of asbestosis in 1982, when he retired, or at any other times while he was employed by defendant. Even Plaintiff's x-rays taken in 1998 and 1999 failed to reveal a profusion rating at the minimum 1/1 level necessary for a diagnosis of asbestosis under the American Thoracic Society standard for differential diagnosis. It was not until 2000 that plaintiff had a chest x-ray that revealed a 1/1 profusion level. Because the x-rays taken by plaintiff's doctors in 1998 and 1999 do not support the diagnosis of asbestosis, how can the Commission infer that the State Dusty Trades monitoring program could have found asbestosis on x-rays that would have been taken before plaintiff's retirement in 1982? The majority assumes that because plaintiff currently is diagnosed with asbestosis, that this diagnosis would have been found by the Dusty Trades Program during plaintiff's employment. Asbestosis, however, does not appear and disappear on x-rays; therefore, the fact that x-rays in 1998 and 1999 did not reveal asbestosis confirms that this disease was not diagnosable prior to plaintiff's retirement, irrespective of whether he was in any monitoring program. Therefore, there is no basis to find that if plaintiff was in the State Dusty Trade monitoring program, that the program would have diagnosed plaintiff's disease while he was employed with defendant. Thus, there is no basis to apply the estoppel doctrine under the circumstances of this case.

While there may be cases where the medical evidence in the record may support the application of an estoppel theory, this case is not one of them.

<center>          <underline>104 WEEKS NOT APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION FOR PLAINTIFF</underline></center>
Plaintiff also suggests that in order to provide compensation within the intent of the Act, the award of 104 weeks is necessary. Plaintiff's argument, however, fails to recognize that plaintiffs, who though they are not <italic>currently</italic> exposed to the hazards of asbestos and thus entitled to 104 weeks of benefits because of removal, are afforded relief for their diagnosed disease under other statutory provisions. In fact, pursuant to § <cross_reference>97-64</cross_reference>, a disabled plaintiff is entitled to recover benefits under §§ <cross_reference>97-29</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97-30</cross_reference>, or <cross_reference>97-31</cross_reference>. <italic>Abernathy, supra; Clark</italic>,<cross_reference>141 N.C. App. at 428-429</cross_reference>; see <italic>Honeycutt v. Carolina Asbestos Co.</italic>,<cross_reference>235 N.C. 471</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>70 S.E.2d 426</cross_reference> (1952) (entitled to ordinary compensation under the general provisions of the Act). The fallacy of plaintiff's argument was explained in <italic>Clark</italic>:

<block_quote>  . . . defendants also contend that "most importantly, the payment of one hundred four weeks of compensation is reserved to those employees who are <italic>actually removed</italic>
from their employment." (Emphasis added). This Court addressed the removal requirement in <italic>Moore v. Standard</italic> <italic>Mineral Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>122 N.C. App. 375</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>469 S.E.2d 594</cross_reference> (1996).</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [T]he term "removal" as used by G.S. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>
presumed medical diagnosis will occur <italic>during</italic> the hazardous employment. Thus the language regarding "removal from the industry" has specific application only to occasions when . . . identified victims of occupational disease  are thereafter "removed" from hazardous industry by a directive of the Commission. However, the phrase is inapposite to instances as that  <italic>sub justice</italic> wherein a claimant is diagnosed at some point <italic>subsequent</italic> to leaving hazardous employment.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  The general rule for recovery for individuals suffering from asbestosis or asbestos-related disorders is found at N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-64</cross_reference> (1991), which provides:</block_quote>

App. at 428-29</cross_reference>; <italic>see Abernathy, supra.</italic>  Thus, because the Act does in fact provide benefits to disabled plaintiffs with asbestosis who are not <italic>currently</italic> exposed to the hazards of asbestos and consequently are not entitled to 104 weeks of benefits, and because there is no sound policy reason to extend the application of § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference> beyond its express and intended purpose, there is no basis to award § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) benefits in this case.

In <italic>Comstock v. Weyerhaeuser Company</italic>, I.C. No. 931412, filed on February 3, 2003, the same Commissioners composing the majority in this case, denied plaintiff's claim for § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) benefits because "a retiree who is no longer employed by the asbestos-exposing industry is not entitled to an order of removal and the subsequent award because he no longer faces the possibility of exposure. <italic>See Austin v. General Tire,</italic><cross_reference>354 N.C. 344</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>553 S.E.2d 680</cross_reference> (2001)." [COL 4 in I.C. No. 931412.] The same majority has also denied the 104 weeks of benefits to a retiree I.C. File No. 002991, <italic>Davenport v. Weyerhaeuser</italic>. The circumstances are no different in this case, and thereby, the results should be the same.

<center>                        <underline>§ <cross_reference>97-88.1</cross_reference> ATTORNEY'S FEES</underline></center>
Finally, the majority opinion finds that plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees for unfounded litigiousness pursuant to § <cross_reference>97-88.1</cross_reference>
should be "held in abeyance." [Conclusion of Law No. 8.] If a ruling on this issue cannot be made at this time, then clearly there are and will be no grounds to assess attorney's fees. If it cannot be determined that the defense is unreasonable, then in fact the defense is patently reasonable as reasonableness is not determined in hindsight. Further, as noted above, this case includes numerous legal issues on which the parties, including defendant, have a right to a ruling by the Commission and subsequently by the Courts. Thus, plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees pursuant to § <cross_reference>97-88.1</cross_reference> must be denied. <italic>See Shaw v. United Parcel</italic><italic>Service</italic>, <cross_reference>116 N.C. App. 598</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>449 S.E.2d 50</cross_reference> (1994), <italic>aff'd per Curiam</italic>,<cross_reference>342 N.C. 189</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>463 S.E.2d 78</cross_reference> (1995).

<center>                               <underline>CONCLUSION</underline></center>
For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff's claim for 104 weeks of benefits pursuant to § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) must be denied. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion remanding this case for reconsideration of § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) benefits.

<block_quote>                                  S/_______________ DIANNE C. SELLERS COMMISSIONER</block_quote>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The "first hearing" expressed in § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference> occurred on 4 June 2002.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The record includes civil court testimony from Joseph Windlick a certified industrial hygienist who was formerly employed by Weyerhaeuser. Although his testimony includes recorded measurement of asbestos fiber exposure in several activities at the Weyerhaeuser paper plants, this testimony is confined to the time periods prior to the Weyerhaeuser abatement program that started in 1973. Mr. Windlick was asked about the changes in the air sampling from the pre-abatement to the post-abatement period, however, the court sustained an objection to this testimony and it was not received in evidence. Thus, Mr. Windlick's testimony is silent on the level of exposure, if any, to asbestos after the abatement. And, his testimony of pre-abatement exposure is not evidence of the current conditions at the Weyerhaeuser plants.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> The stipulation of the parties reads:

<block_quote>  "It is stipulated that the Plaintiff-Employee was last injuriously exposed to asbestos during Plaintiff's employment with Defendant-Employer Weyerhaeuser Company, and specifically, that the Plaintiff-Employee was exposed to asbestos for thirty (30) days within a seven month period, as is required by N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-57</cross_reference>."</block_quote></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> Consistent with the Court of Appeal's decision, the former Chairman of the Industrial Commission, William H. Stephenson, testified:

<block_quote>  Q. Isn't it, sir, only when the individual is being further exposed to asbestos that he has to leave that employment and go to another?</block_quote>

A. That's correct.

Deposition testimony of William H. Stephenson in I.C. No. 902274, at page 49, Goddard v. Weyerhaeuser, that was stipulated into evidence by the parties in this action.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> Plaintiff also suggests that the stipulation of the parties also requires the Commission to enter an order of removal. The stipulation states: "The parties agreed further that should plaintiff be awarded compensation pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) the Deputy Commissioner may include language removing plaintiff from further exposure pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b)." This stipulation is contingent on a finding that "plaintiff be awarded compensation pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b)" and does not otherwise abrogate the requirements of the Commission to comply with § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) of the Act.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn6]</footnote_number> The prerequisites for the order of removal are:

(1) diagnosis of asbestosis or silicosis; and,

<block_quote>  (2) current employment that exposes plaintiff to the hazards of asbestosis or silicosis.</block_quote>

(N.C. GEN. STAT. § <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b). The award of 104 weeks of benefits requires that plaintiff additionally prove a third element:

<block_quote>  (3) that the employee is removed from the industry at the directive of the Commission.</block_quote>

<italic>Id.; Moore,</italic> <cross_reference>469 S.E.2d at 596</cross_reference>; <italic>Clark,</italic> <cross_reference>539 S.E.2d at 376</cross_reference>.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn7]</footnote_number> In particular, the majority without any basis in the evidence finds in Finding of Fact No. 16: "Defendant convinced the State of North Carolina that defendant need not be included in the state Dusty Trades Program since defendant's asbestos medical surveillance served the same purpose."</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn8]</footnote_number> On the issue of whether the Industrial Commission could or would have designated Weyerhaueser a dusty trade, Mr. Stephenson testified:

<block_quote>  Q. Is it your testimony that the industrial commission could or would have designated Weyerhaeuser as a dusty trade if the commission had been advised that Weyerhaeuser was conducting these annual examinations and all which are documented in the exhibit?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  A. The commission would have designated Weyerhaeuser a dusty trade if the commission had been advised by the state board of health that the [asbestos] dust was present as evidenced in this documents.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  A. If the commission had known that the dust levels were as indicated here by the industrial hygienist that I believe was employed by Weyerhaeuser,, the commission would have asked the state board of health to do their own industrial hygiene survey.</block_quote></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn9]</footnote_number> Even, Judge Greene, in <italic>Austin</italic>, wrote:

<block_quote>  "I acknowledge the `removal' requirement of section  <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b) raises concerns regarding whether an employee who chooses to remove himself from employment prior to diagnosis of asbestos should be precluded from receiving 104 weeks of compensation under section  <cross_reference>97-61.5</cross_reference>(b). For example, this statute may encourage employees who are exposed to asbestos to remain in their employment until they receive a diagnosis of asbestosis. These concerns, however, should not be resolved by this Court; rather, the proper forum for addressing these concerns is in the Legislature."</block_quote>

<italic>Austin</italic>, <cross_reference>540 S.E.2d at 836</cross_reference>. This inquiry, however, does not remove the requirement explained by the Supreme Court that the removal from hazardous employment must occur at the "directive of the Commission."<italic>Moore</italic>, <cross_reference>569 S.E.2d at 596</cross_reference>.</footnote_body>
