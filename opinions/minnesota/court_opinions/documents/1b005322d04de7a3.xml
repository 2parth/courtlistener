On April 5, 2000, we indefinitely suspended petitioner Gregory Allen Carpenter from the practice of law, retroactively to November 1, 1999, with no right to petition for reinstatement for a minimum of two years. <italic>In re Carpenter</italic>,<cross_reference>627 N.W.2d 323</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>323</cross_reference> (Minn. 2000). Petitioner applied for reinstatement in April 2010 and the matter was heard by a panel of the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board. The panel found that petitioner had proven by clear and convincing evidence his competence and moral fitness to resume the practice of law. <italic>See In re Swanson</italic>, <cross_reference>343 N.W.2d 662</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>664</cross_reference> (Minn. 1984). The panel further found that petitioner has paid costs under Rule 24, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR), has successfully completed the professional responsibility portion of the state bar examination, is current with continuing legal education requirements, and has satisfied his obligations to the Client Security Board. The panel found that petitioner did not comply with Rule 26, RLPR (requiring notice of suspension to clients, opposing counsel, and tribunals) at the time of his suspension in 2000, but noted that, at the time of his suspension, petitioner had no active clients. The panel recommends that petitioner be reinstated to the practice of law and be placed on probation for a period of two years. The Director and petitioner accept the panel's recommendation.

The court has independently reviewed the file and adopts the panel's recommendation.

Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, effective immediately, petitioner Gregory Allen Carpenter is reinstated to the practice of law and is placed on probation for a period of two years, subject to the following terms and conditions:
