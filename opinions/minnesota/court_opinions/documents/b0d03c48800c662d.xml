The Director of the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility has filed initial and supplementary petitions for disciplinary action alleging that respondent John D. Ellenbecker committed professional misconduct warranting public discipline, namely, misplacing or failing to properly account for client property, failing to pay a professionally-incurred judgment, failing to diligently pursue a client matter and to communicate with that client, and failing to cooperate with the Director's investigation, in violation of Minn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(c)(2), (3), and (4), 8.4(d), 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1(b) and Rule 25, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR).<page_number>Page 326</page_number>

Respondent waives his procedural rights under Rule 14, RLPR, and admits that his conduct violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. The parties have entered into a stipulation in which they jointly recommend that the appropriate discipline is a public reprimand and two years of supervised probation. In addition, the parties recommend that respondent be required to be assessed for issues relating to depression.

The court has independently reviewed the file and approves of the recommended disposition.

Based upon all the files, records, and proceedings herein,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that respondent John D. Ellenbecker is publicly reprimanded and placed on probation for a period of two years from the date of filing of this order under the following terms and conditions:
