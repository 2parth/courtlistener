<opinion_text>FINAL ORDER

The respondents seek review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Martinez (ALJ) dated May 30, 1997, which awarded permanent total disability benefits. The respondents contend that the ALJ insofar as he did not apportion liability for the benefits in accordance with <italic>Anderson v. Brinkhoff</italic>,<cross_reference>859 P.2d 819</cross_reference> (Colo. 1993). We disagree, and therefore, affirm.

This matter was previously before us. In a prior order the ALJ found that the claimant is permanently and totally disabled as the combined result of an occupational disease diagnosed as "mild silicosis" and "moderately severe pulmonary fibrosis," and a nonoccupational disease caused by cigarette smoking, and diagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Relying upon <italic>Anderson v. Brinkhoff, supra</italic>, the ALJ apportioned 70 percent of the claimant's permanent total disability to the occupational disease and 30 percent to the COPD. Therefore, the ALJ ordered the respondents to pay 70 percent of the claimant's permanent total disability benefits.

In an Order of Remand dated March 17, 1997, we set aside the ALJ's order. Insofar as pertinent, we concluded that the ALJ erroneously relied upon <italic>Anderson v. Brinkhoff, supra,</italic> to apportion the claimant's permanent total disability.

<italic>Anderson v. Brinkhoff, supra</italic>, establishes the applicable legal standard for determining whether a claimant has suffered a compensable "occupational disease." Specifically,<italic>Anderson</italic> holds that where the disability for which benefits are sought is the result of one disease, and that disease has only one cause, the claimant's disability is not compensable unless the claimant's occupational risk of the disease is greater than the risk experienced by the general public. Further, where there are dual or concurrent causes of a disease, and an occupational exposure is not a precondition to the development of the disease, the claimant suffers an occupational disease only to the extent that the occupational exposure caused, intensified or aggravated the disability for which compensation is sought. In contrast <italic>Anderson</italic> does not apply where the claimant's "disability" is the result of at least two, diseases, one of which is solely caused by an occupational exposure and one of which is solely caused by a nonoccupational exposure. <italic>See Colorado Mental Health</italic><italic>Institute v. Austill,</italic> <cross_reference>940 P.2d 1125</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1997).

Because the ALJ found that the claimant suffered two, separate and distinct diseases and that the occupational disease was solely caused by the claimant's occupational exposure, we concluded that <italic>Anderson v. Brinkhoff, supra,</italic> does not apply to the facts of this claim. Furthermore, we remanded the matter to the ALJ for a new order which apportions the claimant's permanent total disability in accordance with§ <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 1997.

Section <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2), provides that:

<block_quote>     "In case there is a <italic>previous disability</italic>, the percentage of disability for a subsequent injury shall be determined by computing the percentage of the entire disability and deducting therefrom the percentage of the previous disability as it existed at the time of the subsequent injury." (Emphasis added).</block_quote>

In <italic>Baldwin Construction Inc., v. Industrial Claim</italic><italic>Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>937 P.2d 895</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1997), the court concluded that in the context of § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2), the term "previous disability" refers to a medical problem which impairs the claimant's access to the labor market or renders the claimant unemployable prior to the industrial injury. Consequently, the<italic>Baldwin</italic> court held that it was not proper to apportion permanent total disability between an industrial back injury and a claimant's preexisting, nonindustrial obesity, depression, alcohol abuse, and muscle tension headaches, because the ALJ found that the preexisting medical problems did not independently impair the claimant's earning capacity prior to the industrial injury.

Here, on remand, the ALJ issued the order of May 30, 1997, which incorporated his prior Findings of Fact. The ALJ also found that independent of, and prior to, the onset of disability from the occupational disease the claimant's preexisting COPD did not cause "a significant loss of access to the labor market," or "render the claimant unemployable." Therefore, the ALJ found that the claimant's preexisting, nonoccupational COPD was not a "previous disability" for purposes of apportionment under §<cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2), and ordered the respondents to pay one hundred percent of the claimant's permanent total disability benefits. The respondents timely appealed the ALJ's order of May 30.

The respondents sole argument on review is that the ALJ erred in finding that he suffered two separate diseases. The respondents assert that the ALJ's construction of the term "disease" is a unduly "restrictive." In support, they cite Mosby's Medical Dictionary Fourth Ed. 1994, for the proposition that, "Although a disease is also a type of condition, not every condition is in and of itself a separate disease." The respondents contend that the claimant has only one "disease" which is a "pulmonary" disease. They also contend that the pulmonary disease is the result of two separate "conditions," one of which is the occupational fibrosis and one of which is the COPD.

Moreover, the respondents point out the ALJ's finding that the claimant's permanent total disability is the combined result of the occupational fibrosis and the COPD. Therefore, the respondents contend that the "disability" for which benefits were sought has two causes. Under these circumstances, they argue that<italic>Anderson v. Brinkhoff, supra</italic>, is applicable to apportion liability for the claimant's permanent total disability benefits. We reject these arguments.

Section <cross_reference>8-40-201</cross_reference>(14), C.R.S. 1997, defines an "occupational disease" as:

"a disease which results directly from the employment or the conditions under which work was performed, which can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work, as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, and which can be fairly traced to the employment as a proximate cause and which does not come from a hazard to which the worker would have been equally exposed outside of employment."

The question of whether the claimant's medical problems are the result of one or more occupational diseases is a factual determination for the ALJ. <italic>Campbell v. IBM Corp.,</italic><cross_reference>867 P.2d 77</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993); <italic>Delta Drywall v. Industrial Claim</italic><italic>Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>868 P.2d 1155</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993). Similarly, the determination of whether a claimant's medical problem is a "condition" or a "disease" is factual in nature. Consequently, we must uphold the ALJ's finding that the claimant suffered two distinct diseases if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Section <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(8), C.R.S. 1997; <italic>F.R. Orr</italic><italic>Construction v. Rinta</italic>, <cross_reference>717 P.2d 965</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1985).

Here, Dr. Repsher and Dr. Betchel agreed that COPD and fibrosis are separate and distinct lung diseases. Dr. Betchel also testified that the cause of the claimant's fibrosis was his work as an underground uranium miner and not cigarette smoking. Therefore, the record contains substantial evidence to support the ALJ's finding that the claimant suffered two "diseases," one of which was occupational and one which was non-occupational.

Furthermore, we are unable to find any language in<italic>Anderson,</italic> and the respondents cite none, which supports their theory concerning the distinction between a "condition" and a "disease." To the contrary, <italic>Anderson</italic> is illustrative of the rule that the determination of whether the claimant has suffered a disease and the nature and cause of that disease are questions of fact for the ALJ.

In any case, the issue before the ALJ was permanent total disability and not compensability, and we adhere to our prior conclusion that the apportionment of permanent total disability is governed by § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2). Under § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2), the pertinent issue is whether the preexisting industrial or nonindustrial medical problem was independently "disabling," not whether the combined effects of the preexisting problem and a subsequent occupational disease preclude the claimant from returning to work.

Here, the ALJ found that the COPD was not "disabling" prior to the onset of disability from the occupational disease, and the respondents do not contest this finding. Thus, the ALJ did not err in refusing to apportion the claimant's permanent total disability benefits.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order dated May 30, 1997, is affirmed.
