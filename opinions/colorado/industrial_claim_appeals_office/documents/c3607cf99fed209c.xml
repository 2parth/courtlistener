<opinion_text><center>                                FINAL ORDER</center>
The claimant seeks review of orders of the Director of the Division of Workers' Compensation (Director) denying, in part, a request for a lump sum payment of permanent total disability (PTD) benefits.  We affirm.

Following a reopening of the claim, the claimant was awarded PTD benefits.  The claimant had previously received lump sum payments of permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits in the amount of $34,553.33.

On April 11, 2002, the claimant filed an application for a lump sum payment in the amount of $37,560.  On April 22 and April 23, 2002, the Director entered orders denying the request for a lump sum.  The claimant petitioned to review these orders.

On May 9, 2002, the Director entered an order awarding a lump sum in the amount of $3,006.67.  This amount represented the discounted difference between the lump sums previously awarded for PPD and $37,560. It was the Director's position that § <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 2002, limits the aggregate of all lump sum payments for PTD to $37,560, including lump sum payments previously made for PPD benefits.  (See letter of Claims Manager Staker dated May 29, 2002).

On review, the claimant contends the Director misinterpreted §<cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2).  The claimant argues the statute permits a lump sum payment for PPD in the amount of $37,560 <italic>plus</italic> <italic>an additional</italic> lump sum payment of $37,560 for PTD benefits.  We disagree.

We first note that our authority to review the Director's lump sum orders is extremely limited.  Section <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(1), C.R.S. 2002.  The only permissible review concerns whether or not the Director exceeded the scope of her authority, as where the Director considers some factor not contemplated by the statute. <italic>Warren v. Southern Colorado Excavators,</italic><cross_reference>862 P.2d 966</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993).

Section <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2) provides as follows:

<block_quote>  The aggregate of all lump sums granted to a claimant who has been awarded compensation by the director for permanent total disability or death benefits shall not exceed thirty-seven thousand five hundred sixty dollars.  In the case of permanent partial disability, the director shall order payment on application by the employee not to exceed thirty-seven thousand five hundred sixty dollars to be paid based on the present worth of partial payments, considering interest at four percent per annum.</block_quote>

In <italic>Ritter v. Industrial Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>44 Colo. App. 32</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>615 P.2d 40</cross_reference>
(1980), the court construed the predecessor to § <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2) to mean that the limit on lump sums for PTD benefits should be calculated by including previous awards of lump sums for PPD benefits. At the relevant time, the statute provided "the aggregate of all lump sums granted to a claimant who has been found and declared by the director to be permanently and totally disabled, shall not exceed eighteen thousand six hundred twenty-three dollars and fifty cents."  The court stated that the meaning of the phrase "aggregate of all lump sums" was "clear" and "not subject to construction."  Hence, the statute required that the aggregate of<italic>"all</italic>" lump sum payments be considered in determining the limitation, including PPD lump sums.  (Emphasis in original).

The claimant argues it is appropriate to revisit <italic>Ritter</italic> because the statute has since been amended to create separate limitations on lump sum awards for PTD and PPD benefits, as evidenced by the second sentence of § <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2).  However, the specific statutory phrase construed in<italic>Ritter</italic> has remained unchanged.  Thus, we assume the General Assembly is satisfied with the judicial construction of the phrase "aggregate of all lump sums" as including PPD lump sums, and that it intends for the meaning of the phrase to remain unchanged despite the subsequent statutory modifications.  <italic>Spanish Peaks Mental Health Center v.</italic><italic>Huffaker,</italic> <cross_reference>928 P.2d 741</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1996).  In this regard, we note the first sentence of § <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2) has never been amended to provide a limitation on PTD lump sums which includes "the aggregate of all lump sums granted <italic>except</italic> for lump sums previously granted for PPD benefits." If the General Assembly had intended such an exception it could easily have enacted express language creating such an exception. <italic>Freemyer v.</italic><italic>Industrial Claim Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>32 P.3d 564</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 2000) (if legislature intends certain result it can employ terminology clearly expressing that intent, as it has done in other instances).

Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the statutory interpretation adopted by the Director.  Where, as here, the Director's interpretation of a statute is plausible and not inconsistent with the express statutory language or applicable case law, we defer to her interpretation.  <italic>See Magnetic Engineering, Inc. v. Industrial Claim</italic><italic>Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>5 P.3d 385</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 2000).  It follows we perceive no error in the Director's interpretation of the statute and the consequent refusal to award an additional lump sum of $37,560 based on the claimant's PTD.

We also disagree with the argument that because there are two sentences in § <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(2) we may infer a legislative intent to create consecutive lump sum caps for PTD and PPD benefits. Rather, the existence of the two sentences appears to be a statutory artifact from the time when the General Assembly increased the amount payable for PPD from $26,292 to $37,560, but elected not to increase the lump sum cap for PTD benefits. See 1987 Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 51 Pp. 389-390.  Further, the claimant's argument regarding dependents' benefits is without merit because dependents' benefits are distinct from disability benefits pursuant to the "rule of independence."  <italic>See Metro Glass  Glazing, Inc. v. Orona,</italic><cross_reference>868 P.2d 1178</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1994).  Hence, application of the lump sum cap to an injured employee's PPD benefits would not diminish the amount of a lump sum award available to the worker's dependents in the event of the employee's death.  Put another way, the claimant of PPD benefits is not the same as the claimant of death benefits.

The claimant also argues the lump sum order of May 9 is based on an incorrect average weekly wage.  We first note that the May 9 order was not appealed and is not technically before us.  In any event, the respondents concede that a new admission must be filed after the claimant's average weekly wage is determined in pending litigation. Thus, this issue is premature and need not be addressed at this time.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the orders of the Director dated April 22 and April 23, 2002, are affirmed.
