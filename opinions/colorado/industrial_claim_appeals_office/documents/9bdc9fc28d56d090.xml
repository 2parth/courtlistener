The claimant seeks review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Friend (ALJ) dated January 22, 2008 that denied the claim for permanent total disability. We remand the matter for completion of the record.

On review of the order denying the claim for permanent total disability the claimant raised a number of allegations of error under ยง <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 2007. The claimant requested that the complete record before the Office of Administrative Court, the transcript of hearing and all exhibits be included as a part of the record for the petition to review.

The September 27, 2007 hearing transcript reflects that the respondent moved for admission into evidence a surveillance videotape, marked as exhibit JJ. The exhibit was admitted. Tr. at 79-81. The January 22, 2008 order states that the ALJ expressly relied on the surveillance videotape. Furthermore, the respondent in the brief in opposition to the claimant's petition to review relied on the surveillance videotape.

However, the record transmitted on review does not contain the surveillance videotape cited by the ALJ. Under these circumstances, the record must be remanded for completion of the record. Section <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(9), C.R.S. 2007.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the matter is remanded to the Office of Administrative Courts for completion of the record in accordance with this order. Once the record is complete, the Division shall retransmit the matter for our review.<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
