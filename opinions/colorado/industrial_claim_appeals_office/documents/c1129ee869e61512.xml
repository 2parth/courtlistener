<opinion_text>ORDER

The claimant seeks review of an order of Chief Administrative Law Judge Felter (ALJ) insofar as it requires the parties to select "an authorized treating physician." We dismiss the petition to review without prejudice.

This case apparently proceeded to hearing on two issues. The first issue was the claimant's entitlement to temporary total disability benefits commencing April 12, 1996 and continuing. The ALJ resolved this issue in favor of the claimant.

The second issue concerned medical benefits, and the respondents took the position that the claimant should not receive any further treatment from the authorized chiropractor, Dr. Hameister. The respondents argued that further chiropractic treatment was not reasonable or necessary. (Tr. pp. 20-21).

In his order, the ALJ did not find that Dr. Hameister's treatment was unreasonable or unnecessary. In fact, in his oral remarks, the ALJ stated that he was "reserving decision on continued treatment of Dr. Hameister." (Tr. p. 61). However, the ALJ did order the parties to select "an authorized treating physician" for purposes of examining the claimant and rendering an opinion about the "reasonableness and necessity of any further medical care or treatment."

On review, the claimant contends that the ALJ erred in requiring the parties to select "an authorized treating physician." In effect, the claimant asserts that the ALJ improperly intruded on his statutory right to select the authorized treating physician when the respondents failed to designate a treating physician. We conclude that the ALJ's order is not currently subject to review.

Pursuant to § <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. (1996 Cum. Supp.), a party may file a petition to review an order "which requires any party to pay a penalty or benefits or denies a claimant a benefit or penalty." Orders which do not require the payment of benefits or penalties, or deny the claimant benefits or penalties, are interlocutory and not subject to review. <italic>Natkin  Co. v. Eubanks</italic>, <cross_reference>775 P.2d 88</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1989); <italic>Director</italic><italic>of the Division of Labor v. Smith</italic>, <cross_reference>725 P.2d 1161</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1986). Further, an order may be final and reviewable with respect to one issue, but not with respect to another. <italic>Oxford Chemicals, Inc. v. Richardson</italic>,<cross_reference>782 P.2d 843</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1989).

Here, the ALJ's order requiring the parties to select an authorized physician for purposes of examining the claimant and rendering an opinion is not currently reviewable. The contested portion of the order does not deny the claimant any benefit or penalty, nor does it require the respondents pay a benefit or penalty. In a similar vein, we have previously ruled that an order requiring one party to pay for an independent medical examination is not subject to review because the IME serves an evidentiary function and is not a "benefit." <italic>See Parra v.</italic><italic>Sonnenalp Properties, Inc.,</italic> W.C. No. <cross_reference>3-108-875</cross_reference> (May 17, 1994).

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the claimant's petition to review the ALJ's order dated July 29, 1996, is dismissed without prejudice.
