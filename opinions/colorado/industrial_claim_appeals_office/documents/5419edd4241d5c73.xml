<opinion_text><center>                               FINAL ORDER</center>
The respondents seek review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Henk (ALJ) insofar as it awarded the claimant permanent partial disability benefits based on a 19 percent whole person medical impairment rating.  The respondents contend the ALJ erred in failing to apportion the claimant's impairment rating in accordance with the opinion of the Division-sponsored independent medical examination (IME) physician. We affirm.

The claimant is the spouse of the deceased employee (Nichols).  Nichols sustained a compensable back injury on March 11, 1995, while stacking newspapers.  As a result, the Nichols underwent a discectomy and fusion of the cervical spine at C6-7. Many years prior to the industrial injury Nichols had undergone a discectomy and fusion of the cervical spine at C5-6.  It is now undisputed that Nichols reached maximum medical improvement prior to his death from causes unrelated to the industrial injury.

In April 1999, a Division IME was performed to determine Nichols' impairment for purposes of awarding benefits to the claimant.  In a report dated April 15, 1999, the Division IME physician determined Nichols had an overall medical impairment of 19 percent as a whole person.  This rating was comprised of a 9 percent whole person impairment rating for a surgically treated cervical disc with residual symptoms, plus 1 percent impairment for "multiple levels."  <italic>American Medical Association Guides to the</italic><italic>Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Third Edition, (Revised)</italic> (AMA Guides) (Table 53 II, E and F).  The IME physician also awarded 10 percent whole person impairment for ankylosis of the cervical spine based on the "unfavorable position" of three cervical vertebrae.  (Table 54, AMA Guides).  However, because the IME physician found "objective evidence of a previous surgical fusion at C5-C6," he deducted 7 percent impairment for a surgically treated disc without residual signs (Table 53 II D, AMA Guides), and 2 percent impairment for ankylosis of the cervical spine based on the favorable positioning of two cervical vertebrae (Table 54, AMA Guides).  Consequently, the IME physician's final impairment rating was 10 percent impairment of the whole person "secondary to [Nichols'] injury of 1995."

Applying § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 1998 [amended in 1999 for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1999], the ALJ concluded the respondents are not entitled to "apportionment" of the IME physician's 19 percent whole person impairment rating.  In support of this determination, the ALJ found that "even though Mr. Nichols had a prior impairment, that impairment was not disabling at the time of the subsequent injury."  Specifically, the ALJ found that following the initial spinal fusion the claimant "returned to very physical work and that he was unhampered by his prior cervical surgery."

On review, the respondents contend the ALJ erred in failing to apportion the 19 percent whole person impairment rating in accordance with the Division IME physician's 10 percent rating. Relying principally on our decision in <italic>Johnson v. Christian Living</italic><italic>Campus,</italic> W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-354-266</cross_reference> (October 5, 1999), <italic>aff'd. American</italic><italic>Compensation Insurance Co. v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office,</italic>
(Colo.App. No. 99CA2058, August 3, 2000), and the Court of Appeals opinions in <italic>Egan v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office,</italic><cross_reference>971 P.2d 664</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1998), and <italic>Qual-Med, Inc. v. Industrial Claim</italic><italic>Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>961 P.2d 590</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1998), the respondents argue the 9 percent impairment which the Division IME physician attributed to the claimant's prior spinal surgery was based on a determination of "causation." Consequently, the respondents reason the ALJ was required to defer to the Division IME physician's 10 percent rating unless overcome by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to § <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c), C.R.S. 2000.  Under the circumstances of this case we disagree.

In <italic>Johnson v. Christian Living Campus, supra</italic>, we held that the definition of "apportionment" contained in <italic>Askew v. Industrial</italic><italic>Claim Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>927 P.2d 1333</cross_reference> (Colo. 1996), and the AMA Guides, establishes the line of demarcation between cases requiring the application of apportionment principles embodied in the § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2) and <italic>Askew</italic>, and issues of "causation" under §<cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c).  Consequently, § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2) must be applied if the issue involves "the <italic>degree</italic> to which each of various occupational or nonoccupational factors has contributed to a<italic>particular impairment</italic>."  (Emphasis added).  We concluded that<italic>Egan</italic> and <italic>Qual-Med</italic>, involved issues of "causation" rather than apportionment because the claimants had been assigned "separate upper extremity and cervical impairments" and the question in those cases was whether the "distinct cervical impairments" were causally related to the underlying industrial injuries.  Thus, in<italic>Egan</italic> and <italic>Qual-Med</italic> the issue of "causation" involved an entire component of the claimant's overall impairment, and the ALJ was not entitled to interfere with the rating physicians' resolution of the issue except in accordance with the IME procedure.  <italic>See</italic><italic>also Faulkner v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>, ___ P.2d ___ (Colo.App. No, 99CA1136, May 11, 2000) (citing <italic>Qual-Med</italic> for the proposition that "an IME physician's opinion concerning the cause of a particular component of the claimant's overall impairment must be overcome by clear and convincing evidence").

Here, the respondents argue the issue is one of "causation" because the IME physician was not "trying to determine the relative contributions of occupational and non-occupational factors to the C6-7 problem, or the relative contributions of those factors to the C5-6 problem."  Rather, the respondents assert the IME physician determined that "impairment from one level (9 percent) was due to non-occupational cause, and the impairment from the other level (10 percent) was related to the occupational injury."  Put another way, the respondents contend that each "level" of the claimant's cervical impairment constitutes a separate "component" of the impairment.  However, we agree with the claimant that this attempt to subdivide the claimant's impairment goes beyond the holdings in <italic>Egan</italic> and <italic>Qual-</italic><italic>Med</italic>.

We have previously held that a particular "component" of impairment refers to a unit of impairment which is individually rateable under the AMA Guides.  For instance, in <italic>Johnson v. El</italic><italic>Paso School District No. 11,</italic> W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-345-673</cross_reference> (October 25, 1999), the Division IME physician assigned a 16 percent whole person impairment for lost range of motion in the cervical spine. However, the IME physician reduced the rating to 8 percent because he determined 50 percent of the claimant's impairment was attributable to preexisting degenerative joint disease.  However, we concluded the ALJ properly applied § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2) in rejecting the apportionment because the IME physician's entire impairment rating was based on lost range of motion in the cervical spine and, therefore, the issue involved "the degree to which various factors contribute to a particular impairment".

Here, the rateable components of the claimant's overall impairment involve specific disorders of the cervical spine under Table 53, and ankylosis of the cervical spine under Table 54 of the AMA Guides.  The practical difficulty of dividing the impairment ratings based on the "level" of the claimant's two surgeries is inherent in the IME physician's rating itself.  The IME physician enhanced the rating for specific disorders of the spine by 1 percentage point because the claimant had disc injuries at multiple levels, including the level injured in the prior non-industrial accident.  (Table 53 II F).  Similarly, the IME physician enhanced the rating under Table 54 because the claimant had three cervical vertebrae in unfavorable position. Therefore, this case involves the relative contributions of occupational and nonoccupational factors to two rateable elements of the claimant's cervical impairment, not a determination of whether an entire component of the claimant's impairment is unrelated to the industrial injury.  <italic>Cf. Lambert and Sons, Inc. v. Industrial Claim</italic><italic>Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>984 P.2d 656</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1998) (where the Division IME found the claimant suffered a 12 percent whole person impairment after an industrial back injury, and had also sustained a 12 percent whole person impairment as a result of a prior back injury, apportionment was improper where the evidence established the claimant was asymptomatic from the first injury for a significant period of time before the industrial injury).

Finally, we observe that our resolution of the issue appears to be consistent with the AMA Guides principles for rating spinal impairment.  The AMA Guides state that the "spine consists of three major regions: cervical, thoracic, and lumbar."  Ratings for separate regional impairments of the spine are combined when rating the overall spinal impairment.  Thus, the AMA Guides treat the cervical spine as a single unit for purposes of rating impairment. Further, rating spinal impairment "involves both diagnosis-related factors, such as structural abnormalities, and musculoskeletal or neurologic factors that require physiological measurements." (AMA Guides, § 3.3 Principles for Calculating Impairment).  Thus, it would appear to be inconsistent with the AMA Guides to permit apportionment of a regional impairment rating based on the "cause" of the particular pathologies underlying the rating, except where the requirements of § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2) and <italic>Askew</italic>
are met.

It follows the ALJ properly applied § <cross_reference>8-42-104</cross_reference>(2) when evaluating the Division IME physician's impairment rating. Because it is uncontested that the claimant's preexisting impairment attributable to the prior spinal fusion was asymptomatic and not disabling at the time of the 1995 industrial injury, apportionment was inappropriate as a matter of law.<italic>Lambert and Sons, Inc. v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office, supra</italic>.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order dated December 14, 1999, is affirmed.
