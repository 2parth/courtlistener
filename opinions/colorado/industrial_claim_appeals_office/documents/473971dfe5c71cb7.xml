<opinion_text>ORDER

The respondents seek review of a Supplemental Order of Administrative Law Judge Stuber (ALJ) dated February 12, 1998. We dismiss the appeal without prejudice.

In an order dated June 23, 1997, the ALJ denied medical benefits in the form of a chronic pain program. The claimant timely appealed and argued that the issue of whether the claimant is entitled to these medical benefits was not properly before the ALJ for adjudication. In his Supplemental Order the ALJ determined that the claimant's argument was supported by the record. Therefore, the ALJ set aside the order denying medical benefits in the form of a chronic pain program. The respondents timely appealed the Supplemental Order.

Section <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 1997 provides that a party dissatisfied with an order "which requires any party to pay a penalty or benefits or denies a claimant a benefit or penalty," may file a petition to review. Orders which do not require the payment of benefits or penalties, or deny the claimant benefits or penalties are interlocutory and not subject to review. <italic>Natkin </italic><italic>Co. v. Eubanks</italic>, <cross_reference>775 P.2d 88</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1989).

The ALJ's Supplemental Order does not require the respondents to pay any penalty or benefit, nor does it deny the claimant a benefit or penalty. Rather, the Supplemental Order merely reflects the ALJ's determination that the issue of whether the claimant is entitled to receive medical benefits in the form a chronic pain program is not ripe for adjudication. Consequently, the Supplemental Order is not a final order within the meaning of ยง <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2) and is not currently subject to review. Therefore, we must dismiss the respondents' petition to review.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> the respondents petition for review the ALJ's Supplemental Order dated February 12, 1998, is dismissed without prejudice.
