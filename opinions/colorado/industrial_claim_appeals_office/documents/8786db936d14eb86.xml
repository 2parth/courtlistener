<opinion_text>ORDER DISMISSING PETITION TO REVIEW.

The respondents seek review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Felter (ALJ) dated April 8, 2008, to the extent that it increased the claimant's average weekly wage (AWW) to reflect post-injury increases in his earnings. We conclude that the portion of the order being appealed is not final and reviewable. We therefore dismiss the petition to review without prejudice.

The ALJ's findings of fact are summarized as follows. The claimant injured his right shoulder on September 27, 2004 while working as a fence installer earning an AWW of $650. He continued to work for the respondent employer until December 20, 2007. The claimant's pay rate increased in October 2005 when he began supervising other employees. The claimant later earned more as a driver for the employer than when he worked as a fence installer. At the time of the hearing, the claimant was unemployed, but looking for work that would accommodate daily pain and "crunching" in his shoulder, such as driving or lighter duty than installing fences. Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Order) at 3, ¶ 5. The ALJ found that the claimant established by a preponderance of the evidence that his AWW should be based on his earnings after October 12, 2005, to "more fairly compensate him for his loss of earnings after that time." Order at 3, ¶ 6. He therefore ordered that "[f]or any benefits accruing on and after October 12, 2005, Claimant's AWW is $789.95." Order at 4, ¶ A. The AWW is based on a stipulation by the parties. The ALJ also awarded $88 for disfigurement. However, the ALJ denied the claimant's request for temporary disability benefits.<page_number>Page 2</page_number>

The respondents challenge the ALJ's determination that the claimant's AWW should reflect his post-injury earnings. Thus, the respondents take issue only with the portion of the ALJ's order that establishes the AWW for "any benefits accruing on and after October 12, 2005." Under § <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 2007, a party dissatisfied with an order "which requires any party to pay a penalty or benefits or denies a claimant a benefit or penalty" may file a petition to review. Orders that neither require the payment of benefits or penalties or deny the claimant benefits or penalties are interlocutory and not subject to review.<italic>Natkin  Co. v. Eubanks</italic>, <cross_reference>775 P.2d 88</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1989).

The ALJ's order establishing the claimant's AWW does not apply it to any particular benefit, but merely refers to "any benefits accruing" after a particular date. This appealed portion of the order does not represent an award or denial of benefits or penalties. Consequently, this aspect of the ALJ's order is not final for purposes of review. Section <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2); <italic>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Industrial Claim</italic><italic>Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>988 P.2d 1146</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1999) (the portion of an order which determined liability for penalties without assessing specific amount of penalties was not final for purposes of review); <italic>Bestway</italic><italic>Concrete v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>984 P.2d 680</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1999); <italic>see also, Oxford Chemicals, Inc. v. Richardson</italic>, <cross_reference>782 P.2d 843</cross_reference>
(Colo.App. 1989) (order may be partially final and reviewable and partially interlocutory).

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the respondents' petition to review the ALJ's order dated April 8, 2008, is dismissed without prejudice.
