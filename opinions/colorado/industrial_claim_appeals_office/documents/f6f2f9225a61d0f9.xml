<opinion_text>FINAL ORDER

The respondents seek review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Martinez (ALJ) which required them to pay permanent partial disability benefits based upon medical impairment of 26 percent of the whole person and awarded medical benefits. We affirm.

The ALJ found that the claimant suffered compensable injuries in 1996 when a backhoe bucket released and fell, hitting the claimant on the head and right shoulder and causing the claimant to fall into a ditch. It is undisputed the claimant reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) on August 11, 1997, when Dr. Heil rated the claimant's permanent medical as 24 percent of the whole person due to range of motion deficits in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines and a specific disorder of the lumbar spine.

Dr. Gilman conducted a Division-sponsored independent medical examination (IME) under the provisions of ยง <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c), C.R.S. 1998. Dr. Gilman diagnosed the claimant as suffering from a "chronic cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral myofascial strain," and opined that the claimant sustained 26 percent permanent medical impairment under the <italic>American Medical Association Guides</italic><italic>to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Third Edition</italic> (Revised) (AMA Guides) due to range of motion deficits in the thoracic, cervical and lumbar spine and a specific disorder of the lumbar spine. The claimant was also evaluated by Dr. Primack who rated the claimant's impairment as 9 percent of the whole person due to a specific disorder and range of motion deficits in the lumbar spine.

The ALJ found that the 26 percent impairment rating is supported by objective and valid range of motion measurements conducted by Dr. Gilman and a specific lumbar disorder. Further, the ALJ was not persuaded by Dr. Primack's opinion that Dr. Gilman incorrectly included a rating for impairment of the cervical and thoracic areas. Therefore, the ALJ determined that Dr. Gilman's rating was not overcome by clear and convincing evidence and ordered the respondents to pay medical impairment benefits in accordance with Dr. Gilman's rating. The ALJ also ordered the respondents to pay a bill for treatment by Dr. Rill and the Foot Support Group of $315.

On review, the respondents contend that the ALJ's findings of fact are inconsistent, incomplete and not supported by the evidence. The respondents also contend the ALJ applied the wrong legal standard in awarding permanent partial disability benefits. We disagree.

Section <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c), provides that the IME physician's medical impairment rating is binding unless overcome by "clear and convincing evidence." <italic>Egan v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>, ___ P.2d ___ (Colo.App. No. 98CA0821, November 13, 1998<italic>; Metro</italic><italic>Moving  Storage Co. v. Gussert</italic>, <cross_reference>914 P.2d 411</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1995). The question of whether the IME physician's opinion has been overcome by "clear and convincing evidence" is a factual matter for resolution by the ALJ, and we may not interfere with the ALJ's resolution of this issue if his determinations are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Section <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(8), C.R.S. 1998; <italic>Metro Moving  Storage Co. v. Gussert</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>.

The scope of our review under the substantial evidence standard, is "exceedingly narrow," because we must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party, and defer to the ALJ's credibility determinations, his resolution of conflicts in the evidence, and plausible inferences drawn from the evidence. <italic>Metro Moving  Storage Co. v. Gussert</italic>, <cross_reference>914 P.2d at 415</cross_reference>;<italic>Dow Chemical Co. v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>843 P.2d 122</cross_reference>
(Colo.App. 1992) (ALJ free to credit one medical opinion to the exclusion of a contrary medical opinion). It is also the ALJ's sole prerogative to assess the sufficiency and probative weight of the evidence. <italic>Monfort Inc. v. Rangel</italic>, <cross_reference>867 P.2d 122</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993).

As argued by the respondents, the ALJ determined that "the opinions of Dr. Gilman regarding the claimant's permanent physical impairment are more persuasive than the opinions of Dr. Primack." However, we reject the respondents' contention this finding reflects the ALJ's application of a "persuasiveness" standard in resolving the issue of permanent partial disability. The ALJ expressly recognized that Dr. Gilman's rating was binding unless overcome by "clear and convincing evidence," (Conclusions of Law 1), and determined that the respondents failed to sustain that burden. (Conclusions of Law 2). <italic>See also</italic> Summary Order April 28, 1998. In reaching this determination the ALJ acknowledged the conflict between Dr. Primack and Dr. Gilman and was not persuaded by Dr. Primack's opinions.

Moreover, we agree with the claimant that a standard of "persuasiveness"would appear to be a less stringent requirement than the "free from serious or substantial doubt" standard which characterizes clear and convincing evidence. <italic>See DiLeo v.</italic><italic>Koltnow,</italic> <cross_reference>200 Colo. 119</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>613 P.2d 318</cross_reference> (1980). Thus, any error in the standard of proof for overcoming the IME rating would have advantaged the respondents.

Next, the respondents' argue that the record is devoid of evidence that the claimant suffered "permanent" functional impairment in the thoracic and cervical spines. In support, the respondents rely on Dr. Primack's opinion that the claimant's cervical and thoracic "strain" symptoms are not permanent.

We do not dispute that a permanent medical impairment rating must be based on permanent functional impairment. <italic>Gonzales v.</italic><italic>Advanced Components</italic>, <cross_reference>949 P.2d 569</cross_reference> (Colo. 1997); <italic>Walker v. Jim</italic><italic>Fouco Motor Company</italic>, <cross_reference>942 P.2d 1390</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1997). Furthermore, we recognize that Dr. Gilman was unsure how to define the difference between a temporary and permanent strain. However, Dr. Gilman's deposition also contains evidence which indicates that he considered the claimant's chronic strain symptoms to be "permanent" in nature. It was the ALJ's sole prerogative to resolve the conflict in Dr. Gilman's testimony. <italic>See</italic> <italic>Colorado</italic><italic>Springs Motors, Ltd. v. Industrial Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>165 Colo. 504</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>441 P.2d 21</cross_reference> (1968); <italic>El Paso County Department of Social Services v.</italic><italic>Donn</italic>, <cross_reference>865 P.2d 877</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993) (ALJ may credit all, part or none of witness' testimony).

Dr. Gilman's opinion is supported by Dr. Heil's impairment rating and the undisputed fact that the claimant is at MMI. This evidence supports the inference that the cervical and thoracic spine symptoms the ALJ found to exist by crediting Dr. Gilman's testimony reflect "permanent" not temporary impairment. <italic>See</italic> ยง<cross_reference>8-40-201</cross_reference>(11.5), C.R.S. 1998 (MMI exists when "no further treatment reasonably expected to improve the condition" and the "possibility of improvement" resulting from the passage of time shall not affect a finding of MMI).

The respondents contend the ALJ erred in crediting Dr. Gilman's opinions. In support the respondents rely on evidence that the claimant did not report any thoracic or cervical pain during his examination by Dr. Primack and the claimant did not inform Dr. Gilman that he suffered a 1992 industrial back injury. Therefore, the respondents contend that Dr. Gilman's opinions are based on an incorrect medical history. We are not persuaded.

Dr. Gilman reported that the claimant complained of pain in his neck and upper back at the time of his IME exam. Dr. Heil documented similar pain on August 11, 1997. Dr. Primack's testimony that the claimant did not report any cervical or thoracic pain at the time of his IME reflects a direct conflict in the evidence, and the ALJ resolved the conflict in favor of Dr. Gilman. Further, Dr. Gilman's opinions are supported by the medical reports of Dr. Hansen and the claimant's testimony. (Tr. p. 62).  Consequently, this claim does not involve circumstances which afford us a basis to interfere with the ALJ's credibility determinations. <italic>See</italic> <italic>Halliburton Services v. Miller,</italic> <cross_reference>720 P.2d 571</cross_reference>
(Colo. 1986) (ALJ's credibility determinations are binding unless the testimony is so rebutted by hard, certain evidence that as a matter of law the ALJ would err in crediting the testimony).

Moreover, evidence the claimant suffered permanent impairment from a prior industrial injury pertains to the issue of apportionment, not the question of whether the claimant has <italic>any</italic>
permanent impairment in the thoracic and cervical spines. In any case, the claimant testified that he recovered from the 1992 injury, and Dr. Primack admitted that he had no information the 1992 injury was symptomatic at the time of the 1996 injury. (Tr. p. 50). Therefore, the record does not compel the conclusion that Dr. Gilman's rating is based on misrepresentations by the claimant.

Next, the respondents contend that Dr. Gilman's rating is legally insufficient under ยง <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c), because it is based on "chronic pain without anatomic or physiologic correlation." Again we disagree.

We have previously held that the anatomical correlation requirements in ยง <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c) do not apply where the claimant has a specific disorder of the lumbar spine. <italic>See Welker v. Bogue</italic><italic>Construction, Inc.</italic>, W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-309-642</cross_reference> (March 5, 1998); <italic>Velasquez</italic><italic>v. Roaring Fork Redi Mix</italic>, W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-324-686</cross_reference>, (September 4, 1998). We have also concluded that valid range of motion measurements may constitute anatomic or physiologic correlation of an impairment rating. <italic>Chavez v. J. C. Penny</italic>, W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-153-815</cross_reference> (March 22, 1995). We adhere to our prior conclusions.

Here, Dr. Gilman, Dr. Primack and Dr. Heil agreed that the claimant has permanent impairment due to a specific, unoperated intervertebral disc or other soft-tissue lesion of the lumbar spine as listed in Table 53, page 80 of the AMA Guides. Further, Dr. Gilman's rating of the cervical and thoracic impairment was based upon valid range of motion measurements. Therefore, the record is not devoid of anatomical or physiologic support for Dr. Gilman's rating, and the respondents further arguments on this issue are not persuasive.

The respondents also point out that the ALJ made inconsistent findings of fact concerning Dr. Primack's medical impairment rating. The respondents argue that due to the inconsistency, the ALJ's findings are insufficient to ascertain the ALJ's reasoning in rejecting Dr. Primack's opinions. We disagree.

Finding of Fact 7 states:

<block_quote>     "An important difference in the ratings by Dr. Primack, Dr. Gilman and Dr. Heil is that Dr. Primack did not give impairment ratings for the cervical or thoracic spine. Dr. Primack rated a specific disorder of the lumbar spine based upon a disc lesion and rated the loss of range of motion of the lumbar spine. Unlike Dr. Primack, both Dr. Heil and Dr. Gilman included the claimant's thoracic and cervical spine in their rating of the claimant's permanent medical impairment."</block_quote>

As we read the ALJ's order he determined that Dr. Primack's rating was incomplete insofar as Dr. Primack did not include a rating for impairment of the cervical and thoracic areas. Furthermore, the parties do not dispute that Dr. Primack included a rating for a specific disorder of the lumbar spine. <italic>See</italic>
Claimant's Post-Hearing Position Statement, page 4. Under these circumstances, we consider Finding of Fact 5 to be a clerical error insofar as it states that Dr. Primack"did <italic>not</italic> include a specific disorder for the unoperated lumbar disc region." (Emphasis added).

The respondents also challenge the ALJ's finding that Dr. Primack failed "to perform all the range of measurements required" by the AMA Guides. <italic>See</italic> Conclusions of Law 1. However, we conclude that this determination is a plausible inference from the record.

Dr. Primack admitted that the AMA Guides require use of an inclinometer to measure range of motion for permanent injuries of the cervical and thoracic spine. (Tr. pp. 43, 44). He also admitted that he did not use an inclinometer to measure the claimant's cervical and thoracic range of motion. (Tr. p. 47). Because the ALJ was persuaded that the claimant suffered permanent injuries to the cervical and thoracic areas, the ALJ could, and did, reasonably infer that Dr. Primack incorrectly applied the AMA Guides because he failed to measure the claimant's range of motion in the cervical and thoracic areas. <italic>Cf.</italic> <italic>Metro Moving  Storage</italic><italic>Co. v. Gussert</italic>, <italic>supra.</italic>

<center>                                   II.</center>
Finally, the respondents contend that the issue of medical benefits after maximum medical improvement (MMI) was endorsed for adjudication and that the evidence fails to support a claim for future medical benefits as provided by <italic>Grover v. Industrial</italic><italic>Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>759 P.2d 705</cross_reference> (Colo. 1988). Therefore, the respondents contend the ALJ erred in failing to deny <italic>Grover</italic> type medical benefits.

At the commencement of the hearing on April 7, 1998, the ALJ requested a clarification of the issues for adjudication. (Tr. p. 3). Respondents' counsel stated that the issue was permanent partial disability, and that the "Claimant added as an additional issue <underline>Grover</underline> meds." (Tr. p. 3). The claimant's attorney indicated that the issue of medical benefits was "specifically" a request for the payment of a bill in the amount of $315.

In his Post-Hearing Position Statement, the claimant does not request <italic>Grover</italic> medical benefits. Accordingly, the record reflects that the claimant abandoned the issue of medical benefits after MMI and limited the issue of medical benefits to the unpaid bill of $315. Under these circumstances, we perceive no error in the ALJ's failure to enter an order on the issue of <italic>Grover</italic> type medical benefits.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order dated June 8, 1998, is affirmed.
