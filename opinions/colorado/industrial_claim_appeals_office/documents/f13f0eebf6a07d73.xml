<opinion_text>FINAL ORDER

The respondent-insurers separately petitioned or review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Erickson (ALJ) dated July 14, 1998. The matter was subsequently transmitted to us for review. We dismiss the Petitions for Review.

Subsequent to our receipt of the record, the parties entered into an agreement for the full and final settlement of the claim. The settlement was approved by the Division of Workers' Compensation on December 30, 1998.

Thereafter, counsel for the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company filed a motion to withdraw their Petition for Review. In a letter dated January 22, 1998, Counsel for the Wausau Insurance Companies (Wausau) notified us that Wausau also seeks to withdraw it's appeal.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the petitions to review the ALJ's order dated July 14, 1998, are dismissed with prejudice.
