<opinion_text>FINAL ORDER

The claimant seeks review of a final order of Administrative Law Judge Martinez (ALJ), which denied and dismissed his claim for permanent total disability benefits. We affirm.

The ALJ found that the claimant sustained compensable injuries to his left wrist, neck and back on August 5, 1988. Ultimately, the claimant's treating physicians restricted him from lifting in excess of forty-five pounds, from repeated hammering with his non-dominant left hand, from repetitive stooping or bending at the waist, overhead work, and repetitive jarring.

The ALJ credited the testimony of the respondents' vocational witnesses, and found that the claimant is capable of performing several available jobs despite the restrictions imposed by the treating physicians. The ALJ also found that, although the claimant does have residual pain, the pain does not preclude him from returning to employment. Thus, the ALJ concluded that the claimant failed to prove that he is permanently and totally disabled.

The claimant has not filed a brief in support of his petition to review the ALJ's order. The only specific allegation of error contained in the petition to review is that the claimant's "restrictions in excess of the doctor's restrictions are sufficient to render the claimant permanently and totally disabled." Due to the absence of a brief in support of this contention, the effectiveness of our review is somewhat limited.

Under the law applicable to this claim, permanent total disability exists if the claimant has lost, and will not regain, efficiency in some substantial degree in a field of general employment. <italic>Byouk v. Industrial Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>106 Colo. 430</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>105 P.2d 1087</cross_reference> (1940). The ALJ has wide discretion in determining the extent of permanent disability, and his order must be upheld if supported by substantial evidence in the record. <italic>Professional</italic><italic>Fire Protection, Inc. v. Long,</italic> <cross_reference>867 P.2d 175</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993). In applying the substantial evidence test, we must defer to the ALJ's resolution of conflicts in the evidence, his credibility determinations and the plausible inferences which he drew from the evidence. <italic>Metro Moving  Storage Co. v. Gussert</italic>,<cross_reference>914 P.2d 411</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1995).

Here, the ALJ's order reflects that he applied the correct legal standard. Moreover, he resolved conflicts in the evidence and determined that the claimant's physical restrictions were those imposed by the treating physicians, and that the claimant could find employment within those restrictions. Insofar as the claimant testified that he had restrictions in excess of those imposed by the treating physicians, the ALJ was not persuaded by such testimony.

Under these circumstances, the ALJ's order must be upheld. We are in no position to substitute our judgement for that of the ALJ concerning the credibility of the witnesses or weight of the evidence. The mere fact that the evidence might have supported contrary findings and conclusions is immaterial on review. <italic>May D</italic><italic> F v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>752 P.2d 589</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1988).

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order dated February 27, 1997, is affirmed.
