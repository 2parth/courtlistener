<opinion_text>ORDER OF REMAND

The claimant seeks review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Rumler (ALJ) insofar as the ALJ denied her request for temporary disability benefits commencing March 19, 1996. We set aside the contested portion of the order, and remand the matter to the ALJ for the entry of a new order.

The claimant suffered a compensable injury on November 3, 1995, arising out of her employment as a psychiatric nurse for the respondents. On November 9 Dr. Dietz restricted the claimant from performing her regular job duties. However, the ALJ found that, without discussing Dr. Dietz's restrictions with her employer, the claimant resigned from her employment effective December 1, 1995.

The ALJ further found that the claimant failed to reestablish a causal connection between the industrial injury and her subsequent wage loss. In so doing, the ALJ rejected a report dated March 19, 1996, in which Dr. Parry stated that the claimant was "not able to return to work at this time in a job as a clinical nurse specialist." Consequently, the ALJ denied and dismissed the claim for temporary disability benefits from December 1, 1995 through April 9, 1996, and continuing.

On review, the claimant contends that the ALJ was not free to disregard Dr. Parry's opinion that the claimant is unable to perform her regular work. Therefore, the claimant contends that the ALJ erred in failing to award temporary disability benefits commencing March 19, 1996. We conclude that the ALJ's findings are insufficient to permit appellate review of the claimant's argument.

Where a claimant is found to be "at fault" for the loss of the employment out of which the injury arose, the claimant is not entitled to temporary disability benefits in connection with her subsequent wage loss, unless the claimant reestablishes a causal connection between the industrial disability and the wage loss.<italic>PDM Molding, Inc. v. Stanberg</italic>, <cross_reference>898 P.2d 542</cross_reference> (Colo. 1995). However, the claimant is not required to prove that the industrial injury is the sole cause of the wage loss. Rather, temporary disability benefits are precluded only when the work-related injury plays no part in the subsequent wage loss. <italic>Lindner</italic><italic>Chevrolet v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>914 P.2d 496</cross_reference>
(Colo.App. 1995). Consequently, the claimant is entitled to temporary disability benefits if the industrial injury contributed "to some degree" to the wage loss. <italic>PDM Molding, Inc. v. Stanberg, supra</italic>.

As indicated by the court in <italic>PDM Molding, Inc. v. Stanberg,</italic><italic>Inc.</italic>, the term "disability" refers to the claimant's physical inability to perform her regular employment duties. Furthermore, the applicable law provides that the attending physician's opinion of the claimant's physical ability to perform the duties of her regular employment is dispositive. Section <cross_reference>8-42-105</cross_reference>(3), C.R.S. (1995 Cum. Supp.) [amended 1996 Colo. Sess. Laws, ch. 173 at 827 for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 1996]; <italic>Blue Mesa Forest</italic><italic>v. Lopez,</italic> ___ P.2d ___ (Colo.App. No. 96CA0436)<italic>; Burns v. Robinson</italic><italic>Dairy, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>911 P.2d 661</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1995). Accordingly, the ALJ is not free to reject an "attending" physician's opinion that the claimant is unable to return to her regular employment, unless there are multiple attending physicians with conflicting opinions. In that event, the ALJ may resolve the conflict as a matter of fact. <italic>Blue Mesa Forest v. Lopez, supra</italic> (resolution of conflicting opinions on maximum medical improvement a question of fact for the ALJ)<italic>; Burns v. Robinson Dairy, Inc.</italic>, <italic>supra.</italic>

Here, the claimant asserts that the evidence compels a conclusion that Dr. Parry was the claimant's only "attending" physician as of March 19, 1996. We disagree, and decline to substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder on this issue.

However, the ALJ made no factual determination concerning whether Dr. Parry was the claimant's "attending physician" as of March 19, 1996. Nor did the ALJ determine whether the claimant had more than one attending physician as of March 19. Therefore, the ALJ's findings of fact are insufficient to permit appellate review of the claimant's contention that the ALJ erroneously rejected Dr. Parry's opinion. <italic>Blue Mesa Forest v. Lopez, supra.</italic> Consequently, the matter must be remanded for additional findings.

On remand, the ALJ shall determine whether Dr. Parry was the claimant's attending physician as of March 19. If Dr. Parry was an attending physician, the ALJ is not free to discredit Dr. Parry's opinion concerning the claimant's ability to work, unless the claimant had multiple attending physicians as of March 19, <italic>and</italic>
those the physicians held conflicting opinions concerning the claimant's physical ability to perform her regular employment.

If the ALJ determines that the claimant was restricted from regular employment commencing March 19, the ALJ shall also redetermine whether the industrial injury contributed "to some degree" to the claimant's subsequent wage loss.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order dated, May 28, 1996, is set aside insofar as the ALJ denied the claim for temporary disability benefits commencing March 19, 1996, and the matter is remanded to the ALJ for a new order consistent with the views expressed herein.
