<opinion_text>ORDER

This matter is before us pursuant to the opinion of the Court of Appeals dated May 30, 1996, and its mandate issued on January 27, 1997.  In its opinion, the court set aside our order dated May 10, 1995, and remanded with directions to enter an order consistent with the views expressed by the court.

In our order dated May 10, 1995, we held that the claimant's "personal employee" (PET) time was not includable in her average weekly wage.  The court set aside our conclusion, and established a specific formula to be utilized in calculating the claimant's average weekly wage based on the inclusion of the PET time. Under these circumstances, the matter must be remanded to Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) for implementation of the court's calculation of the claimant's average weekly wage, and payment of benefits accordingly.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the matter is remanded to the ALJ for implementation of the decision of the Court of Appeals.
