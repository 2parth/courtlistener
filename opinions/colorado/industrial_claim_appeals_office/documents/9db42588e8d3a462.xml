<opinion_text>FINAL ORDER

The claimant seeks review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Friend (ALJ) dated February 13, 2008, that denied the claimant's request to have her own physician attend her for post maximum medical improvement (MMI) care. We affirm.

The ALJ made the following pertinent findings of fact. The respondents filed a final admission of liability and admitted for medical benefits after MMI. Dr. Reichhardt was the authorized medical care provider prior to the claimant reaching MMI and he remained authorized after MMI. The claimant requested maintenance medical care at the employer's nurses' station and the employer declined to refer her for medical care. However, the claimant could have sought care from Dr. Reichhardt and was not required to seek the approval from the employer. The claimant did not seek care with Dr. Reichhardt. The claimant's counsel then wrote a letter to the insurer requesting <italic>Grover</italic> medical care with the authorized treating physician and the insurer responded stating that "if you are seeking a specific treatment please advise and I will review for relatedness to the worker's compensation injury." The claimant never provided the requested additional information. The parties proceeded to a previous hearing solely on the issue of <italic>Grover</italic> medical care and ALJ Connick entered an order for the insurer to pay for a single follow-up medical visit with the authorized treating physician. The insurer arranged for an appointment with Dr. Reichhardt and the claimant failed to appear for the appointment. The insurer has not refused to provide an authorized physician and Dr. Reichhardt did not refuse to provide treatment to the claimant.

Here the ALJ determined that the claimant has not made a proper showing to have her own physician attend her pursuant to ยง <cross_reference>8-43-404</cross_reference>(5), C.R.S. 2007. The ALJ found that<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
the respondents had not failed to name an authorized physician; rather, the claimant failed to seek his care. The ALJ denied the claimant's request to have her own physician attend her for post-MMI care.

We initially note that we have considered the respondent's argument that the order is not presently final and reviewable under ยง <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 2007. The respondents argue that the ALJ's decision to deny the claimant's request to transfer care to her own personal physician does not deny the claimant a new benefit in light of a previous order, which granted an evaluation with Dr. Reichhardt. However, we have previously ruled that an order that denies a request for a change of physician to a specific doctor is equivalent to the denial of a specific benefit and therefore is final and reviewable. <italic>McCormick v. Exempla Health Care</italic>, W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-594-683</cross_reference> (November 27, 2007); <italic>Landeros v. CF  I Steel</italic>, W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-395-493</cross_reference> (October 26, 2000); <italic>Vigil v. City Cab Company</italic>, W.C. No.<cross_reference>3-985-493</cross_reference> (May 23, 1995). Here, the claimant's request that her own physician attend her was denied. We decline to depart from the reasoning of those previous orders.

On appeal the claimant notes that she is not seeking to change physicians based upon a refusal by the authorized treating physician to treat. Instead, the claimant argues that the right to select the physician passed when she notified the respondents that she requested maintenance medical care. The claimant cites a number of cases that hold when claimant seeks to reopen a claim alleging a worsening condition and requests additional medical treatment that the respondents must designate a physician to treat the worsened condition or the right to select the physician passes to the clamant. The claimant contends that the same principle applies when the injured worker requests <italic>Grover</italic> medical care.<italic>See Grover v. Industrial Comm'n</italic>, <cross_reference>759 P.2d 705</cross_reference> (Colo. 1988).

Section <cross_reference>8-42-101</cross_reference>(1), C.R.S. 2007, requires the employer to provide medical benefits which are reasonable and necessary to cure the industrial injury. <italic>See Snyder v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>,<cross_reference>942 P.2d 1337</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1997). Under ยง <cross_reference>8-43-404</cross_reference>(5)(a), the employer or insurer is afforded the right in the first instance to select a physician to treat the injury. <italic>Clark v. Avalanche Industries Inc.</italic>, W. C. No. 4-471-863 (March 12, 2004). Section <cross_reference>8-43-404</cross_reference>(5)(a) covers requests to change physicians and provides that upon the proper showing to the division, the employee may procure its permission at any time to have a physician of the employee's selection attend the employee. A claimant is not precluded from seeking or obtaining a change in physicians after having reached MMI. <italic>Story v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>910 P.2d 80</cross_reference>
(Colo.App. 1995).

We are not persuaded that because the claimant was entitled to<italic>Grover</italic>-type medical benefits, the obligation of the claimant to seek treatment from the authorized<page_number>Page 3</page_number>
treating physician was changed. The claimant has cited no authority for this proposition and we are aware of none. The cases cited by the claimant holding that the respondents must designate a physician to treat the claimant when a petition to reopen is filed are distinguishable because in those cases the claim has been closed. The employer's obligation to provide medical treatment terminates at MMI, except where the employee is entitled to ongoing treatment to prevent a deterioration of her condition. <italic>See Grover v. Industrial Comm'n, supra.</italic>

Here the respondents admitted for Grover medical benefits and designated a treating physician to supply those medical benefits. The ALJ found that Dr. Reichhardt remained authorized for post-MMI treatment and the claimant was free to seek treatment with him but the claimant failed to seek his care. We agree with the ALJ's resolution of this matter and perceive no error in the ALJ's order.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order issued February 13, 2008 is affirmed.
