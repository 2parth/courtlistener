<opinion_text>ORDER OF REMAND

The respondents Ken Caryl Glass, Inc,. and Colorado Compensation Insurance Authority (CCIA), seek review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Wells (ALJ) which "amended" a lump sum order issued by the Director of the Division of Workers' Compensation (Director). We set the order aside and remand for further proceedings.

A review of the procedural history of this matter is necessary. The claimant sustained an industrial injury in August 1992. The injury rendered the claimant permanently and totally disabled. As a result, the CCIA and the Subsequent Injury Fund (SIF) filed a Final Admission of Liability in March 1995. The claimant was admitted to be permanently and totally disabled as of April 1, 1994, with the CCIA to assume liability for eighty-five percent of the benefits and the SIF to assume liability for fifteen percent of the benefits.

In March 1995 the claimant filed an application for a lump sum distribution. On March 29, 1995, the Director issued a "Lump Sum Award Order" which granted the claimant a maximum lump sum of $37,560. The lump sum order also provided that the claimant's permanent total disability benefits would continue until age sixty-five, and calculated the remaining weekly benefits accordingly.

On April 24, 1995, the claimant filed a "Motion to Amend Order" with the Division of Workers' Compensation (Division). The motion noted that §<cross_reference>8-42-111</cross_reference>(5), C.R.S. (1995 Cum. Supp.), which provides for termination of permanent total disability benefits when the claimant reaches age sixty-five, was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals. <italic>Romero</italic><italic>v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office,</italic> <cross_reference>902 P.2d 896</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1995), <italic>cert. granted</italic>, 95SC227, August 28, 1995. Consequently, the claimant requested that the Division amend the lump sum order by providing that the claimant's permanent total disability benefits continue for life, and also recalculate the amount of the weekly benefits.

On May 15, 1995, the claimant filed an Application for Hearing on the issue of "permanent partial benefits."  The application indicated that the respondents wrongfully withheld a portion of the lump sum award. On or about May 23, 1995, the claimant moved to amend his application to add the issue of whether the Director's lump sum award properly terminated the claimant's permanent total disability benefits at age sixty-five, and therefore, incorrectly calculated the remaining weekly benefits. The motion to add the issue was granted on June 7, 1995.

The matter was submitted to the ALJ on briefs. In an order dated August 28, 1995, the ALJ noted that § <cross_reference>8-42-111</cross_reference>(5) was found to be unconstitutional in <italic>Romero.</italic>  Consequently, the ALJ ordered that the Director's March 29, 1995 lump sum order be "amended" to reflect that the claimant was entitled to permanent total disability benefits for life, and "remanded" to the Division for recalculation of the weekly benefits.

On review, the CCIA argues that the ALJ lacked jurisdiction to alter the Director's lump sum order. The CCIA further argues that, in any event, the ALJ incorrectly applied <italic>Romero</italic> to the facts of this case. We agree with the jurisdictional argument, and therefore, set aside the ALJ's order and remand to the Director for further proceedings.

Section <cross_reference>8-43-406</cross_reference>(1), C.R.S. (1995 Cum. Supp.) provides as follows:

<block_quote>     "At any time after six months have elapsed from the date of injury, the director, in the exercise of discretion, . . . may order payment of all or any part of the compensation awarded in a lump sum, or in such manner as the director may determine to be for the best interests of the parties concerned, and the director's order shall be final and not subject to review."</block_quote>

Under this statute, the Director's decision to award or deny an application for a lump sum award is largely unreviewable. The only exception exists where a party alleges that the Director has exceeded the scope of her authority as, for example, if the Director were to consider a factor unrelated to the best interests of the parties. <italic>Warren v. Southern</italic><italic>Colorado Excavators,</italic> <cross_reference>862 P.2d 966</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1993).

It is apparent from the statutory scheme that ALJs are assigned no role in either the issuance or review of lump sum awards. Rather, jurisdiction to award lump sums is vested with the Director, and review of that determination is to be in accordance with the procedures set forth in § <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>, C.R.S. (1995 Cum. Supp.).

Moreover, the express provisions of § <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference> deny ALJs any authority to review a Director's award or denial of a lump sum. Subsection (2) provides that petitions to review may be filed "<italic>with the Director if the</italic><italic>order was entered by the Director,</italic> or with the administrative law judge at the place indicated in the order, if the order was entered" by the ALJ. Thus, it is apparent that the review scheme contemplates that the Director will conduct the initial review of any order which she enters, and determine whether to issue a supplemental order, conduct an additional hearing, or forward the matter to the Industrial Claim Appeals Office for review. Section <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(4)  (5), C.R.S. (1995 Cum. Supp.). <italic>See also</italic><italic>Coven v. Industrial Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>694 P.2d 366</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1984) (it is within discretion of the "presiding hearing officer" whether to hold additional hearings or refer a case for review by the Industrial Commission).

It follows that the ALJ erred when he purported to amend the Director's lump sum order and remand the matter to the Division for action in accordance with the ALJ's order. Initial jurisdiction to review the award rested with the Director, and it was for the Director to determine whether to issue a supplemental order or transmit the matter to us for review.

Under these circumstances, the ALJ's order must be set aside. Further, the matter must be remanded to the Director for consideration of, and appropriate action on, the claimant's "Motion to Amend Order."  In view of this disposition, we need not consider the other issues raised by the parties.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order, dated August 28, 1995, is set aside.

<bold>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED</bold> that the matter is remanded to the Director of the Division of Workers' Compensation for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
