<opinion_text><center>                               FINAL ORDER</center>
The claimant seeks review of an order of Administrative Law Judge Gallegos (ALJ). The claimant contends the ALJ erred in refusing to order the respondents to pay for medical testing required by the physician selected to perform the Division-sponsored independent medical examination (DIME). We disagree and, therefore, affirm.

On May 26, 1995, the claimant suffered a compensable injury when she was accidentally sprayed in the face with a chemical degreaser used to clean cooking grills. The ALJ found the claimant developed pulmonary problems as a result of the injury. On October 17, 1999, Dr. Simon placed the claimant at maximum medical improvement (MMI) with no permanent impairment. The claimant disputed Dr. Simon's opinions and requested a DIME under the provisions of § <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(b)(II), C.R.S. 2000.

The DIME physician, Dr. Volz, ordered blood tests, methacoline tests, a spirametry, allergy testing and a cat scan of the claimant's sinuses. Based upon the test results Dr. Volz assigned a 12 percent whole person impairment rating and recommended future medical treatment. The respondents filed a Final Admission of Liability for permanent partial disability benefits in accordance with the DIME physician's rating.

The claimant subsequently requested an order requiring the respondents to pay for the testing performed by Dr. Volz to complete the DIME. The claimant argued that § <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(c) required Dr. Simon to make the initial impairment rating based upon the <italic>American Medical</italic><italic>Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Third</italic><italic>Edition, Revised</italic> (AMA Guides), and Dr. Simon misapplied the AMA Guides by negligently failing to order diagnostic testing which would have revealed the claimant's pulmonary impairment. The claimant argued that under these circumstances, requiring the claimant to pay the cost of the testing ordered by Dr. Volz shifts the financial burden of assessing permanent disability from the respondent to the claimant in contravention of §<cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(b)(I), C.R.S. 2000.

The ALJ found that the Rules of Procedure, Part XIV(4)(a), 7 Code Colo. Reg. 1101-3 at 58 establishes the procedure for allocating the cost of a DIME. The ALJ also found that neither Dr. Volz nor the claimant complied with Rule XIV(4)(a) regarding the testing Dr. Volz performed to complete his medical impairment rating. Furthermore, the ALJ found there was no agreement for the respondents to pay for the diagnostic testing. Therefore, the ALJ refused to order the respondents to pay for the testing. This appeal followed.

On review, the claimant renews her contention that the testing ordered by Dr. Volz would not have been necessary had Dr. Simon properly evaluated her pulmonary impairment at the time he determined the claimant to be at MMI. The claimant argues that failing to impose liability on the respondents for the testing encourages respondents to designate treating physicians who will refuse to order diagnostic testing which is reasonable and necessary to properly rate impairment rate under the AMA Guides.

As a preliminary matter, the respondents argue the ALJ's order is interlocutory and not subject to review because it does not award or deny any benefit or penalty within the meaning of § <cross_reference>8-43-301</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 2000. In support, the respondents point that we have previously held that DIMEs serve an evidentiary function akin to discovery, and therefore, orders assigning liability for the cost of a DIME are interlocutory and not subject to review. <italic>See</italic> <italic>Houston v. Electron Corp</italic>., W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-198-575</cross_reference>
(September 28, 1994); <italic>Hoffschneider v. Francis Constructors Inc</italic>., W.C. No. <cross_reference>3-108-989</cross_reference> (June 6, 1994); <italic>Parra v. Sonnnenalp Properties Inc</italic>., W.C. No. <cross_reference>3-108-875</cross_reference> (May 17, 1994).

However, interlocutory orders become reviewable when incident to a final order which awards or denies benefits or penalties. <italic>BCW</italic><italic>Enterprises, Ltd. v. Industrial Claim Appeals Office</italic>, <cross_reference>964 P.2d 533</cross_reference>
(Colo.App. 1997)<italic>; American Express v. Industrial Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>712 P.2d 1132</cross_reference>
(Colo.App. 1985). Here, neither party disputed the DIME physician's medical impairment rating, and the respondents admitted liability for permanent disability benefits consistent with that rating. Accordingly, allocation of the cost of the DIME is now incident to a final award of benefits and, thus, is reviewable.

Rule XIV(L)(4)(a) provides that:

<block_quote>     "The Division IME physician shall be prepaid a total fee of $450 for each IME by the requesting party unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the director or an administrative law judge. If the record review is unusually extensive and requires longer than an hour for review, the physician shall contact the Division and request additional payment. This request should be made no later three calendar days prior to the IME examination. The Division will transmit the request to the requesting party. If the requesting party declines to pay, the IME physician shall complete the IME process to the best of his/her ability without expending the additional time on record review. . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>     The same processes as listed above shall apply with regard to any clinical or diagnostic testing requested by physicians performing IMES. If additional files review charges are approved, the physician shall bill at the rate set forth in Rule XVIII E.7.c."</block_quote>

Rule XIV(L)(4)(a) contemplates that any request for the reallocation of the cost of the DIME be made prior to the completion of the DIME.

Here, the claimant disputed Dr. Simon's rating by requesting a DIME. The DIME physician ordered additional testing. However, the DIME completed his medical impairment rating prior to the claimant's request that the respondents be ordered to pay for the testing. The claimant does not dispute the ALJ's finding that neither she nor the DIME physician complied with Rule XIV(L)(4)(a). This finding supports the ALJ's refusal to order the respondents to pay for the testing requested by Dr. Volz.

The claimant's further arguments have been considered and are not persuasive. We perceive no conflict between Rule XIV(L)(4)(a) and §<cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8). Section <cross_reference>8-42-107</cross_reference>(8)(b)(I) requires the authorized treating physician to make the initial determination of medical impairment based upon the AMA Guides. However, the statute allows either party to dispute the treating physician's rating by requesting an DIME. Rule XIV(L)(4)(a) allocates the cost of the DIME to the party requesting the DIME in the absence of a stipulation or order to the contrary.

Furthermore, even though the claimant incurred more than $450 to disprove the accuracy of Dr. Simon's rating, we are not persuaded that the respondents must be held liable for the cost of the DIME to discourage them from designating physicians who will misapply the AMA Guides. The statute contains a sufficient disincentive by requiring the respondents to overcome the DIME physician's rating by "clear and convincing evidence."  Insofar as the claimant contends Dr. Simon neglected his duties as the treating physician, allocating the cost of the DIME is not one of the established mechanisms to remedy that problem. <italic>See Aren Design, Inc. v. Becerra</italic>, <cross_reference>897 P.2d 902</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1995).

Moreover, the respondents' admission of liability for permanent partial disability benefits consistent with the DIME physician's rating does not necessarily mean the respondents admitted the testing ordered by Dr. Volz was reasonable and necessary to treat the industrial injury. The final admission merely reflected the respondents admission that there is insufficient evidence to overcome the DIME physician's medical impairment rating by "clear and convincing evidence."  In fact, we have previously concluded that medical testing requested by the DIME physician is not intended as a diagnostic tool for purposes of treatment, but as a request for authorization to perform procedures which will assist the DIME physician in making the necessary factual and evidentiary determinations underlying the findings of MMI and medical impairment. <italic>Beede v. Allen</italic><italic>Mitchek Feed  Grain</italic>, W.C. No. <cross_reference>4-317-785</cross_reference> (April 20, 2000). Similarly, the DIME physician is not a treating physician. To the contrary, §<cross_reference>8-43-502</cross_reference>(2), C.R.S. 2000 expressly prohibits an DIME physician from becoming the authorized treating physician. We adhere to our previous conclusions.

<bold>IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED</bold> that the ALJ's order dated April 25, 2000, is affirmed.
