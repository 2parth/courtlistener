<opinion_text>[1] In this mortgage foreclosure action, defendant, Oscar S. Wyatt, Jr., appeals from an order of the trial court granting the motion of plaintiff, George P. Jouflas, to appoint a receiver pursuant to C.A.R. 1(a)(4).  Wyatt contends that Jouflas impermissibly filed a new motion after a previous motion  requesting the appointment of a receiver had been denied ten months earlier, and that the court abused its discretion in granting the motion to appoint.  We disagree with Wyatt's contentions and affirm.

[2] In October 1977, Jouflas sold the subject property to Wyatt for $6,364,000.  Wyatt paid $300,000 down and executed a non-recourse promissory note for the balance of the purchase price and secured the note with a mortgage on the property in question. Pending in the trial court are Wyatt's<page_number>Page 947</page_number>
allegations that there was a second agreement in which Jouflas agreed to reduce the purchase price and the corresponding amount of the note if a subsequent sale by Wyatt was for less than an agreed upon price, and that there was a further agreement that no interest was to be paid pending the subsequent sale.  Also at issue is a promissory note executed by Jouflas to Wyatt for $153,000 which was secured by a partial assignment of the mortgage executed by Wyatt in favor of Jouflas.  It is without dispute that no payment has been made on the original note.

[3] Jouflas commenced suit in October 1979 and moved for appointment of a receiver in May 1980.  At that time, Wyatt had entered into a contract to sell the property for a sales price of $3,200,000 but had not consummated the sale.  After a hearing on the matter, the trial court denied the motion.  No appeal was taken from this denial.

[4] Approximately ten months later, Jouflas filed another motion for appointment of a receiver.  By the time of the second motion, the sale of the property had been consummated for the originally agreed upon sales price, and approximately $442,000 of additional interest had accrued upon the note.  With a different district judge presiding, this second motion was granted.

[5] As a preliminary matter, we do not agree with Wyatt's contention that Jouflas was an improper party to move for the appointment of a receiver because he has assigned the note and mortgage to Wyatt to secure the $153,000 debt and to co-defendant Andrikopoulos to secure a debt of approximately $60,000.  These two assignments were only partial assignments for security purposes.  As a partial assignor, Jouflas retained part of his substantive right and is a real party in interest under C.R.C.P. 17(a).  3A<italic>Moore's Federal Practice</italic> ¶ 17.09(1.-1) (2d ed. 1979).

[6] Wyatt asserts that it is impermissible for a judge to rule on a matter that was previously ruled upon by a judge of the same district. This principle is not applicable here.  Sufficient new facts were alleged in the second motion to allow the second judge to enter a different ruling than that of the first judge, in the same manner that that judge could have, had he been apprised of the new facts.  <italic>See K-R Funds, Inc.</italic><italic>v. Fox</italic>, <cross_reference>640 P.2d 257</cross_reference> (Colo.App. 1981); <italic>Sunshine v. Robinson</italic>, <cross_reference>168 Colo. 409</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>451 P.2d 757</cross_reference> (1969).

[7] <italic>Melville v. Weybrew</italic>, <cross_reference>108 Colo. 520</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>120 P.2d 189</cross_reference> (1941) is not inconsistent with this holding.  <italic>Melville</italic> involved an appeal of an issue that had previously been decided by the Supreme Court, and the court ruled that its prior appellate determination was <italic>res judicata</italic> on the issue of an appointment of a receiver.  The holding in <italic>Melville</italic> does not, as Wyatt would have us rule, prevent a trial court judge from hearing a renewed motion for appointment of a receiver upon changed conditions.

[8] We also disagree with Wyatt's contention that Jouflas' failure to appeal the denial of his first motion precludes his submission of a new motion to appoint a receiver.  Although an order granting or denying the appointment of a receiver is appealable, as of right, pursuant to C.A.R. 1(a)(4), it is not mandatory that an appeal be taken from such an interlocutory order.  9 <italic>Moore's Federal Practice</italic> ¶ 110.18 (2d ed. 1980). If no interlocutory appeal is taken, the order remains subject to revision by the trial court.  And this revision is permissible especially where, as here, there are changed circumstances.  <italic>Tanner Motor Livery Ltd.</italic><italic>v. Avis, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>316 F.2d 804</cross_reference> (9th Cir. 1963); 9 <italic>Moore's Federal Practice</italic>
¶ 110.25[2].

[9] The appointment of a receiver is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and absent an abuse of that discretion its decision will not be overturned upon review.  <italic>Oman v. Morris</italic>, <cross_reference>28 Colo. App. 124</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>471 P.2d 430</cross_reference> (1970).  Upon the record before us, we find no abuse in the court's granting of the motion to appoint a receiver.

[10] At the time of appointment of the receiver, approximately $7.7 million was due on the note.  The property which was<page_number>Page 948</page_number>
the sole asset to which Jouflas could look as security for the debt had been sold for $3.2 million, thus indicating its value to be substantially less than the amount of the debt.  These new facts afforded a sufficient basis for the trial court to have reconsidered the prior ruling and justified its appointment of a receiver at that time.

[11] Wyatt's remaining contention is without merit.

[12] Order affirmed.

[13] JUDGE STERNBERG and JUDGE KIRSHBAUM concur.
