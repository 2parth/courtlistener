The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved a Conditional Admission of Misconduct submitted by the parties and publicly censured Jolene C. Blair (Attorney Registration No. 15934), effective September 9, 2008. Respondent and another district attorney negligently failed to take adequate steps to ensure the free flow of information and materials between investigative personnel and their office sufficient to place in their possession or control all material relevant to the accused in a murder case. The prosecution relied entirely on their investigator to decide what information would be transmitted to the prosecution and, therefore, ultimately disclosed to the defense. As a result, they failed to disclose information in the possession of, and generated by, those who participated in the investigation and evaluation of the case. Respondent's misconduct constituted grounds for the imposition of discipline pursuant to C.R.C.P. 251.5 and violated Colo. RPC 1.3, 3.4(d), and 8.4(d).<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
