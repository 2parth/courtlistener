The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved the parties' Conditional Admission of Misconduct and suspended Respondent William V. Crossman, Jr., attorney registration number 01702, from the practice of law in the State of Colorado, effective October 15, 2004, for a period of two years, all but 90 days stayed upon successful completion of a twenty-one month period of probation. Respondent neglected or failed to handle competently and diligently several client matters, in violation of Colo. RPC 1.1 and 1.3. In one matter, Respondent represented an elderly woman who lived in an assisted living facility. He filed a claim for legal separation against his client's husband to try to obtain money from the sale of the family home so the wife could stay in the facility. The husband lived in a locked Alzheimer's unit. Respondent erroneously attempted to serve the husband at the Alzheimer's unit instead of the husband's conservator. After the husband died and the matter was settled, Respondent delayed for many months removing a <bold>lis pendens</bold> from the home. In other cases, Respondent violated Colo. RPC 1.4 (a) when failed to return client calls or otherwise respond to client requests for information. He also did not provide an accounting and failed to refund unearned fees to a client after he was terminated. This conduct violated Colo. RPC 1.15 (b). Respondent was ordered to pay the costs of this proceeding and comply with other conditions.
