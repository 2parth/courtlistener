The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved the parties' Conditional Admission of Misconduct and suspended Respondent John Tyler Makepeace (Registration No. 3029) from the practice of law for a period of one year and one day, effective July 7, 2005. All but 30 days of the suspension is stayed pending successful completion of a two-year period of probation. This proceeding arises out of Respondent's misconduct in five separate client matters. In sum, Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence, failed to communicate adequately regarding both the representation and his fees, and failed to record and handle funds properly. Thus, Respondent violated Colo. RPC 1.3 (neglect of an entrusted legal matter), 1.4(a) (failure to keep client reasonably informed and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information), 1.5(b) (failure to communicate basis of fee agreement in writing within a reasonable time after commencing representation), 1.15(a) (failure to hold client property separate from the attorney's own property), and 1.15(g) (failure to maintain adequate financial records). Conditions of probation include a practice monitor, as well as successful completion of an ethics course and a trust account course. Respondent was also ordered to pay the costs incurred in conjunction with this proceeding.
