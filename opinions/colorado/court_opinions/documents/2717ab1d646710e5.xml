The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved the parties' Conditional Admission of Misconduct and publicly censured Respondent Lance Eldon Isaac, attorney registration number 22918. In several matters, Respondent failed to competently represent his clients in violation of Colo. RPC 1.1 by making errors in the content and timing of court filings and failing to file the proper pleadings, documents, or fees. He also neglected legal matters entrusted to him in violation of Colo. RPC 1.3 by not taking timely action in these cases to protect his clients' interests, which resulted in harm. During these time periods, Respondent suffered from serious health problems that caused or contributed to his misconduct. Respondent was ordered to pay the costs of the proceeding.
