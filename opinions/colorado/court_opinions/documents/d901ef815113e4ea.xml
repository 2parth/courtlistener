The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved a Conditional Admission of Misconduct submitted by the parties and disbarred James F. Donaldson (Attorney Registration No. 08951) from the practice of law, effective December 11, 2007. Respondent knowingly converted approximately $25,000.00 from his aunt's estate that should have been distributed to his cousin and used the funds for his own pressing financial needs. Respondent's misconduct constituted grounds for the imposition of discipline pursuant to C.R.C.P. 251.5 and violated Colo. RPC 8.4(c) and 3.3(a).<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
