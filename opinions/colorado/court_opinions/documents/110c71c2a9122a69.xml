The Presiding Disciplinary Judge approved a Conditional Admission of Misconduct submitted by the parties and suspended Lance Eldon Isaac (Attorney Registration Number 22918) for a period of one year and one day, all stayed upon the successful completion of three-year period of probation, with conditions, effective June 21, 2011. Isaac failed to timely transmit his client's child support payments to opposing counsel, resulting in a contempt citation levied against his client. This, in turn, forced his client to incur costs and expenses in defending the contempt proceedings. His misconduct constitutes grounds for the imposition of discipline pursuant to C.R.C.P. 251.5 and violated Colo. RPC 1.3 and 1.15(b).<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
