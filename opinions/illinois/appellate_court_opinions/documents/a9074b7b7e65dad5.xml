<opinion_text>[EDITORS' NOTE:  OPINION WITHDRAWN AUGUST 5, 2009]

</opinion_text>
<posture>  Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County, No. 06 L 12632, Jennifer Duncan-Brice, Judge, presiding.

</posture>
<opinion_byline>  JUSTICE THEIS delivered the opinion of the Court:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  In this defamation action, plaintiff David N. Missner appeals from an order in which the circuit court converted defendant Robert A. Clifford's motion to dismiss under section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (<cross_reference>735 ILCS 5/2-619</cross_reference>(a)(9) (West 2006)) into a motion for summary judgment under section 2-1005 of the Code (<cross_reference>735 ILCS 5/2-1005</cross_reference>
(West 2006)), and subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, Missner argues that the circuit court erred in: (1) converting defendant's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment; and (2) granting summary judgment for defendant on the grounds that his publication of defamatory material was protected by the fair report privilege. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.<page_number>Page 2</page_number>

In his complaint<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>, plaintiff, an attorney, alleged that he was retained by Nicholas Betzold, Jr. to represent him personally in a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding (<cross_reference>11 U.S.C. ยง 1101</cross_reference> <italic>et seq.</italic> (2000)).<underline>In re Betzold</underline>, <cross_reference>316 B.R. 906</cross_reference> (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2004). At the same time, Betzold was involved in a separate arbitration proceeding against three minority shareholders of the financial services companies that he controlled. Plaintiff did not represent Betzold or the companies in the arbitration.

Soon after initiating the bankruptcy proceeding, plaintiff filed a motion in that case to stay the pending arbitration because the arbitrator had an undisclosed relationship and "common association" with attorney Michael Ficaro, who represented the shareholders in the arbitration. In support of his motion, plaintiff attached the affidavit of a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent named Francis Marrocco, which Betzold's arbitration attorneys obtained while attempting to substitute the arbitrator in that proceeding. Plaintiff asserted that the arbitration attorneys gave him the Marrocco affidavit before he filed the bankruptcy proceeding; he did not participate in procuring the affidavit.

Approximately one year after plaintiff filed the bankruptcy proceeding and the motion to stay, Ficaro filed a complaint for defamation against plaintiff and others arising out of the filing of the Marrocco affidavit in the bankruptcy proceeding. Ficaro v. Betzold, No. 05-L-8474 (Cir.<page_number>Page 3</page_number>
Ct. Cook Co.).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Defendant represented Ficaro in that defamation suit through his law firm, Clifford Law Offices. Defendant was listed as "Attorney for Plaintiff' on the original and first amended Ficaro complaints, along with attorneys Richard Burke and Shannon McNulty.

Plaintiff alleged that shortly after filing the first amended complaint in the Ficaro defamation case (Ficaro complaint), defendant issued a defamatory press statement to the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin, which accused plaintiff of the following acts in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding:

<block_quote>  "(a) `forg[ing] the signature of an ex-FBI agent to a fictitious, created, false and untrue affidavit . . .'</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (b) ma[king] `intentional false and scurrilous statements . . . in an attempt to improperly influence the outcome of some vigorously contested corporate litigation . . .'</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (c) concoct[ing] the Marrocco [the ex-FBI agent] affidavit `to try to pressure Ficaro to settle a lawsuit in which his clients were seeking $15 million from the businessman, Nicholas Betzold.'</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (d) `intend[ing] to extort Ficaro and his law firm into settling' the lawsuit by using the Marrocco affidavit."</block_quote>

Plaintiff alleged that the press statement constituted defamation<italic>per se</italic> because it conveyed that he lacked integrity in the discharge of his professional duties and accused him of<page_number>Page 4</page_number>
committing the crime of extortion. Plaintiff also alleged that defendant knowingly made the above false statements to the media, or made them with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, because defendant made no inquiries before issuing the statements, as evidenced by the fact that the arbitration attorneys, who allegedly obtained the affidavit, were not named as defendants in the Ficaro complaint. Plaintiff attached no exhibits to his complaint.

In response, defendant filed a combined motion for summary judgment and motion to dismiss the complaint under section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code. He argued for summary judgment on the grounds that he did not publish the statements of which plaintiff complains or cause them to be published. He noted that the Ficaro complaint to which plaintiff refers was verified by Ficaro and signed and filed by attorney Burke. In an affidavit attached to the combined motion, defendant denied communicating with any newspaper representatives about the Ficaro complaint or the contents of the press statement of which plaintiff complains. He stated that he was out of town at the time the Ficaro complaint and press statement were issued and that he did not communicate with anyone in his office about the press statement or newspaper articles. He also stated that he did not review or discuss the press statement before it was issued.

Defendant also attached the affidavit of Pamela Menaker, communications partner at Clifford Law Offices. She admitted sending the press statement to the Chicago Tribune by e-mail, but had no recollection of contacting the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin. She drafted the press statement in consultation with Ficaro and Burke, but did not discuss or review the press statement with defendant. She attached a copy of the press statement, entitled "Statement of<page_number>Page 5</page_number>
Robert A. Clifford in response to the filing of the Amended Complaint before Judge Donald Suriano in <underline>Ficaro v. Betzold, et al.</underline>, No. 5 L 8474," to her affidavit.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss in the alternative in which he asserted three affirmative defenses. First, he argued that regardless of who published the press statement, the fair report privilege protected that publication because it was a fair abridgement of the contents of a filed complaint. Second, he argued that the statements of which plaintiff complained could be construed innocently as an attorney's biased presentation of his client's view of a pending cause of action. Third, he argued that the press statement is an expression of opinion protected by the first amendment. In addition to his and Menaker's affidavits, defendant attached several exhibits to his combined motion, including a copy of the Ficaro complaint, a copy of the press statement that was sent to the Chicago Tribune, and the articles published in the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Daily Law Bulletin.

The parties agreed to participate in limited discovery regarding the issues raised in defendant's combined motion. As part of that agreement, plaintiff deposed defendant and Menaker, noting on the record the limited scope of the deposition and the parties' understanding that the witnesses could be recalled to testify about the allegations in the underlying complaint if plaintiff's case survived the combined motion.

Menaker testified that she sent the press statement and a file-stamped copy of the amended Ficaro complaint to the Chicago Tribune. She relied upon the original and amended Ficaro complaints and Burke for information about that case. She believed she had the authority of the law firm to issue a press statement in defendant's name. She did not contact defendant<page_number>Page 6</page_number>
before issuing the press statement. She sent the press statement knowing that the newspaper would only accept it if it was a statement from defendant individually and not a statement of the law firm.

In his deposition, defendant testified that Menaker does not serve as an independent spokesperson for the law firm. She issues press statements in defendant's name with "some measure of direction" from defendant. When asked whether Menaker acted as his apparent agent in issuing the press statement, defendant stated that newspapers only accept statements from individuals and not from entities such as law firms. He added that "[u]nquestionably[, the press statement] is sent as a statement of Robert A. Clifford. Unquestionably[,] Pamela Menaker is the one who did it. Unquestionably[,] she ultimately had the authority to do so ***."

Defendant denied that he had seen the amended Ficaro complaint before it was filed or that he participated in the drafting of it, although he had seen the original complaint before it was filed. He testified that between the time of filing the original and amended Ficaro complaints, he participated in meetings with Ficaro and others pertaining to the case and "whatever pleadings were filed or to be filed." He further stated that up to the time of filing the amended Ficaro complaint, he participated in meetings, discussions, and planning about allegations involving the Marrocco affidavit. He also participated in strategy and planning sessions to discuss how to defend the amended Ficaro complaint.

Defendant acknowledged that Burke was authorized to include defendant's name in the signature block on the Ficaro complaint filed with the court, although Burke signed and filed it with the court, which he also was authorized to do. Defendant stated that he does not routinely<page_number>Page 7</page_number>
sign any pleadings himself. However, he also stated that it was not his firm's practice to routinely include his name on every pleading that was filed. Additionally, defendant acknowledged that he had the authority to withdraw any pleading if he felt it was improperly filed for any reason, although he did not do so in this case.

In responding to the motion to dismiss, plaintiff preliminarily argued that the substance of defendant's motion challenged the essential allegations of his complaint and was not proper for disposition under section 2-619(a)(9). He claimed that the three privileges asserted by defendant were not true affirmative defenses but, rather, defendant was attacking the factual bases of his <italic>prima facie</italic> case. Alternatively, plaintiff argued that if the court proceeded on the motion as one for dismissal, he should be permitted to use defendant's and Menaker's depositions to rebut those factual attacks.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> He relied on this argument as a basis for denial and did not seek to strike the motion.

He argued in substance that the fair report privilege did not shield defendant from liability in this case because defendant improperly conferred the privilege on himself, according to section 611, comment c, of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 611, Comment <italic>c</italic>, at 299 (1977). That is, defendant caused the publication of the original defamatory statements in the Ficaro complaint and he published a fair abridgment of those statements by way of the press statement. Additionally, plaintiff maintained that the press<page_number>Page 8</page_number>
statement was not susceptible to an innocent construction nor was it a constitutionally protected statement under the first amendment. Finally, he argued that the court should deny defendant's motion for summary judgment because the depositions provided at least circumstantial evidence that defendant published the press statement or caused it to be published by way of an actual or apparent agency relationship with Menaker.

The court denied the motion for summary judgment. It found that defendant authorized Menaker to issue press statements in his name. Defendant was "fully aware of and approved" the procedure by which media outlets contacted Menaker for press statements. Thus, a jury could reasonably conclude that Menaker was defendant's agent for purposes of issuing the press statement, regardless of whether defendant provided any input in drafting the statement or whether he reviewed the statement.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

The court then declared that "[b]ecause defendant's press statement was not included in the pleadings," the motion to dismiss was "more in the nature of a motion for summary judgment" and considered it as such. It determined that plaintiff had established <italic>a prima facie</italic> case of defamation; therefore, it had to determine whether the privileges asserted by defendant applied to shield him from liability. It rejected defendant's arguments that the press statement was susceptible to an innocent construction or that it was a constitutionally protected opinion under the first amendment. Those rulings are not before us on appeal.

As to the fair report privilege, the court acknowledged plaintiff's argument that one cannot confer that privilege on himself by making the original defamatory statement and<page_number>Page 9</page_number>
reporting on it. However, it determined that defendant did not make the original defamatory statements in the Ficaro complaint. Rather, it found that Ficaro made the statements by verifying the Ficaro complaint pursuant to section 1-109 of the Code (<cross_reference>735 ILCS 5/1-109</cross_reference> (West 2006)). Therefore, the self-conferral exception did not preclude defendant from asserting the fair report privilege. The court went on to conclude that the press statement was a fair abridgment of the allegations contained in the amended complaint. Therefore, the press statement was privileged, regardless of whether it was he or Menaker who made the statement, and summary judgment for defendant was appropriate.

Plaintiff sought reconsideration of the court's ruling, first arguing that the court erred in converting the motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion. He argued that there was no basis for such conversion where defendant neither mislabeled nor misdesignated his motion as one for dismissal. Furthermore, he claimed that he was prejudiced because by finding that Ficaro made the original defamatory statement, the court disposed of the case on an issue that the parties had not argued and could not have investigated due to their stipulation to limit the scope of discovery.

Plaintiff also argued on the merits that the court erred in finding that Ficaro's verification constituted a "publication" in the parlance of defamation law. He contended that a verification is an oath that the contents of the pleading are true, but the pleading is not communicated to third parties, and thus not a "publication," until it is filed with the court. Alternatively, if Ficaro's verification was the original publication of the defamatory statements, then defendant was still liable as a republisher when he caused the Ficaro complaint to be filed.<page_number>Page 10</page_number>

The court declined to reconsider its order, noting that the parties treated the motion to dismiss as a summary judgment motion themselves. They engaged in discovery and relied upon extrinsic evidence in support of their arguments on the motion. They also "argued the applicability of the fair report privilege to the facts in this case. In other words, the parties structured the briefs in conformance with a motion for summary judgment."

The court also rejected plaintiff's claims of prejudice. First, it noted that plaintiff never requested additional discovery or objected to the limitations on the scope of discovery; thus, he cannot now claim that the he was unable to pursue discovery on the issue of Ficaro's verification. Additionally, it found plaintiff's argument that Ficaro's verification raised a new issue not addressed by the parties to be "misleading." It concluded that plaintiff raised the issue himself when he argued that defendant could not self-confer the fair report privilege, forcing the court to make a determination as to who made the original defamatory statements.

On appeal, plaintiff reasserts the arguments made in his motion for reconsideration, namely that: (1) the circuit court erred in converting the motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion; and (2) the court erred in applying the fair report privilege here because defendant improperly conferred the privilege upon himself.

Plaintiff first argues that the circuit court improperly converted the motion to dismiss into a summary judgment motion <italic>sua sponte</italic> after it denied the motion to dismiss. He cites to the court's dispositional order in its entirety in support of that contention. However, nothing in the text of the order indicates that the court first denied the motion to dismiss and then granted summary judgment when no motion was before it. On the contrary, the court held that<page_number>Page 11</page_number>
defendant's motion was "improper" under section 2-619(a)(9) and was "in the nature of a motion for summary judgment"; therefore, it would be treated as such. It made no ruling on the motion under section 2-619(a)(9).

Plaintiff further objects to the court's conversion on the grounds that defendant deliberately, though improperly, brought his motion as one for dismissal and did not mislabel or misdesignate the arguments in his combined motion. That, he argues, is the only permissible basis for making such a conversion under <underline>Malanowski v. Jabamoni</underline>, 293 Ill. App. 3d 720,723-24 (1997), and then only if the opposing party suffers no prejudice.

Although we are compelled to note that converting the motion from one for dismissal to one for summary judgment was unnecessary under the facts of this case, it was not reversible error because plaintiff has suffered no prejudice. Significantly, the court's analysis would have been the same regardless of which procedural device it employed.

Contrary to plaintiff's assertion below, the privileges asserted by defendant are true affirmative defenses that may be raised in a section 2-619(a)(9) motion to dismiss a defamation action. <underline>Anderson v. Beach</underline>,<cross_reference>386 Ill. App. 3d 246</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>248</cross_reference> (2008); <underline>Solaia Technology, LLC v. Specialty</underline><underline>Publishing Co.</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d 558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>580-81</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>585</cross_reference> (2006). Additionally, contrary to the circuit court's determination, section 2-619 and Supreme Court Rule 191 permit a court to consider depositions and affidavits offered in support of or in opposition to a motion to dismiss.<underline>Stafford-Smith, Inc. v. Intercontinental River East, LLC</underline>,<cross_reference>378 Ill. App. 3d 236</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>239-40</cross_reference> (2007), citing <underline>Raintree Homes, Inc. v.</underline><underline>Village of Long Grove</underline>, <cross_reference>209 Ill. 2d 248</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>262</cross_reference> (2004); see also<cross_reference>735 ILCS 5/2-619</cross_reference>(a), (c) (West 2006); 210 Ill. 2d R. 191. Therefore, defendant properly asserted the<page_number>Page 12</page_number>
privileges as affirmative defenses in his section 2-619 motion to dismiss and the court should have considered them as asserted.

However, in the end, it is a distinction without a difference. When reviewing a motion to dismiss under section 2-619, the circuit court must determine whether the motion and the documents supporting it disclose any disputed issues of fact and, ultimately, whether the affirmative defense negates the plaintiff's cause of action in its entirety. <underline>Turner v. 1212 S. Michigan Partnership</underline>, <cross_reference>355 Ill. App. 3d 885</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>892</cross_reference> (2005), quoting <underline>Waterford Executive Group. Ltd. v. Clark/Bardes,</underline><underline>Inc.</underline>, 261 Ill. App. 3d 338,343 (1994). Similarly, summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <underline>Outboard Marine Corp.</underline><underline>v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.</underline>, <cross_reference>154 Ill. 2d 90</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>102</cross_reference>(1992).

Thus, whether the court made that determination under section 2-619 or on summary judgment in this case, the analysis would have been the same: did the evidence submitted by the parties demonstrate the existence of a question of material fact to preclude disposition as a matter of law? As such, plaintiff cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the court's procedural maneuver in converting the motion and there is no reason to reverse the trial court on that basis. See <underline>Turner</underline>,<cross_reference>355 Ill. App. 3d at 893</cross_reference>; see also <underline>Malanowski</underline>, <cross_reference>293 Ill. App. 3d at 724</cross_reference>. Plaintiff's stated claim that he suffered prejudice because he was unable to conduct discovery on or otherwise respond to the court's finding that Ficaro made the original defamatory statement is best addressed below in our review of the substance of the court's order.<page_number>Page 13</page_number>

The circuit court determined that plaintiff established a <italic>prima facie</italic>
case of defamation <italic>per se.</italic> See <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 579-80</cross_reference>
(describing five categories of statements that are defamatory <italic>per se).</italic>
However, even a statement that is defamatory <italic>per se</italic> may not be actionable if an absolute or qualified privilege applies to shield a defendant from liability. <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 580-81</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>585</cross_reference>. Here, we review the circuit court's determination that as a matter of law, defendant was entitled to assert the fair report privilege and was not precluded from doing so by the self-conferral exception.

<block_quote>  The fair report privilege is a qualified privilege that protects:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    "[t]he publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern *** if the report is accurate and complete or [is] a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported." Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 611, at 297 (1977) (as adopted by our supreme court in <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>,  <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 585</cross_reference>).</block_quote>

It is an exception to the general common law rule that the republisher of defamatory material bears the same degree of liability for defamation as the original publisher. <underline>Catalano v. Pechous</underline>, <cross_reference>83 Ill. 2d 146</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>168</cross_reference>
(1980); S. Terilli, S. Splichal,  P. Driscol, <italic>Lowering the Bar:</italic><italic>Privileged Court Filings as Substitutes for Press Releases in the Court</italic><italic>of Public Opinion</italic>, 12 Comm. L.  Pol'y 143, 157-58 (2007); 1 R. Sack, Sack on Defamation: Libel, Slander  Related Problems, 7-2, 7-3 (3d ed. 2004) (noting that courts traditionally refuse to distinguish between "tale bearers" and "tale makers"). This privilege protects our system of self-governance and serves<page_number>Page 14</page_number>
the public interest by permitting access to all public proceedings, and judicial proceedings and filings in particular, regardless of whether defamatory statements are made in those proceedings. <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>,<cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 585</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>600</cross_reference> (Freeman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that the privilege is based on several theories arising out of a reporter's roles as agent for the public, government watchdog, and educator). These larger civic interests outweigh a competing interest in compensating persons for loss of reputation resulting from publication of defamatory statements contained in public or judicial proceedings. <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 599</cross_reference> (Freeman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), quoting J. Lee  B. Lindall, Modern Tort Law ยง 36:32, at 36-47 (2d ed. 2002).

Both media and nonmedia reporters may claim protection under the privilege. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 611, Comment c, at 299 (1977); <underline>Kurczaba v. Pollock</underline>, <cross_reference>318 Ill. App. 3d 686</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>707</cross_reference> (2000). But see B. Wessel, <italic>Libel Claims Against Lawyers for Statements Made to the</italic><italic>Press</italic>, 16 Fall Comm. Law. 21, 22 (1998) (noting that some jurisdictions limit the application of the privilege to media reporters only). However, the availability of the privilege does not depend on the status of the reporter; rather, it is conditioned upon the fairness and accuracy of the report. <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 599</cross_reference> (Freeman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), citing J. Lee  B. Lindall, Modern Tort Law ยง 36:24, at 36-39 (2d ed. 2002). For example, a reporter abuses the privilege when he mischaracterizes an allegation in a pleading as a fact or adds information to the report that was not part of the official proceeding. 12 Comm. L.  Pol'y, at 162. Many of the cases involving the fair report privilege focus on the<page_number>Page 15</page_number>
content of the report in relationship to the original defamatory statement. See, <italic>e.g.</italic>, <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 595-96</cross_reference>; <underline>Myers v.</underline><underline>The Telegraph</underline>, <cross_reference>332 Ill. App. 3d 917</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>924</cross_reference> (2002).

However, before a court can determine whether the fair report privilege has been abused, it must first decide whether the privilege applies where it is asserted. Application of the privilege varies by jurisdiction and is controlled by statute in a few states. 16 Fall Comm. Law. at 22; see,<italic>e.g.</italic>, N.Y. Civ. Rights Law ยง <cross_reference>74</cross_reference> (1992) (fair report privilege applies to any person, firm, or corporation reporting on public proceedings); Cal. Civ. Code ยง <cross_reference>47</cross_reference> (2004) (any report of public proceedings is privileged, except as noted therein); Tex. Civ. Prac.  Rem. Code Ann. ยง <cross_reference>73.002</cross_reference>
(2005) (fair report privilege applies to media reporters alone in reporting on public proceedings).

Under the common law rule, "[a] person cannot confer [the fair report] privilege upon himself by making the original defamatory publication himself and then reporting to other people what he had stated" under the guise of privilege, even if the original publication was itself privileged. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 611, Comment c, at 299 (1977). Some jurisdictions have modified the common law rule to specifically afford litigants or their attorneys heightened protection for reporting on the contents of pleadings they have published or court proceedings in which they participate. 16 Fall Comm. Law. at 22; see,<italic>e.g.</italic>, <underline>Rosenberg v. Helinski</underline>, <cross_reference>328 Md. 664</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>685-86</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>616 A.2d 866</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>876-77</cross_reference>
(1992) (rejecting section 611, comment <italic>c</italic>, and holding that the "[fair report] privilege will be forfeited only if the defamer illegitimately fabricated or orchestrated events so as to appear in a privileged forum in the first place. *** It is clear that<page_number>Page 16</page_number>
[the privilege] *** aims to deter those persons who, acting out of a corrupt defamatory motive, abuse the privilege accorded to fair and accurate reports of judicial proceedings").

Although our supreme court has not squarely addressed this threshold issue, it has otherwise adopted section 611 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, including comment <italic>c.</italic> <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 588</cross_reference>, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 611, Comment <italic>c</italic>, at 299 (1977);<underline>Catalano</underline>, <cross_reference>83 Ill. 2d at 167-68</cross_reference>. <italic>See also</italic> <underline>Kurczaba</underline>,<cross_reference>318 Ill. App. 3d at 707-08</cross_reference> (concluding, with little discussion, that the privilege did not apply where an attorney published the defamatory contents of a pleading he also drafted). The court's endorsement of section 611, comment c, is made without reservation, unlike its treatment of section 611, comment <italic>d.</italic> <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 588-89</cross_reference>
(rejecting section 611, comment <italic>d</italic>, which would have required that a court take some judicial action in a matter before a reporter could publish a report on the contents of a pleading). Therefore, we are bound to apply section 611, comment c, in accordance with supreme court precedent.<underline>O'Casek v. Children's Home  Aid Society of Illinois</underline>, <cross_reference>229 Ill. 2d 421</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>440</cross_reference>
(2008).

Defendant claims that the fair report privilege protects him from liability in this case because even if he did publish the press statement, the original defamatory statements in the Ficaro complaint were published either by Ficaro through his verification of the complaint or by Burke at the time he filed the complaint with the court. The circuit court determined as a matter of law that Ficaro published the original defamatory statements contained in the complaint by way of verification. Additionally, it concluded that defendant's press statement was a fair report of the Ficaro complaint; therefore, defendant was protected by the fair report privilege.<page_number>Page 17</page_number>
We disagree. Ordinarily, determining the applicability of a privilege is a question of law. <underline>Solaia Technology</underline>, <cross_reference>221 Ill. 2d at 585</cross_reference>. However, in this case, there remains a question of material fact as to who published the original defamatory statements; therefore, summary judgment was improper.

"Publication" is a term of art in defamation law and is an essential element of any defamation claim. <underline>Emery v. Northeastern Illinois Regional</underline><underline>Commuter R.R. Corp.</underline>, <cross_reference>377 Ill. App. 3d 1013</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1021-22</cross_reference> (2007). Any act by which defamatory matter is communicated to someone other than the person defamed is a publication. <underline>Anderson</underline>, <cross_reference>386 Ill. App. 3d at 249</cross_reference>; Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 577, Comment <italic>a</italic>, at 201-02 (1977). To "communicate" means to convey information to another. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 460 (1981). Whether a publication occurred at all is a question for the jury. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 617, Comment a, at 315 (1977).

We have previously recognized that the filing of an amended complaint may constitute a publication. <underline>Withall v. Capitol Federal Savings of</underline><underline>America</underline>, <cross_reference>155 Ill. App. 3d 537</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>542</cross_reference> (1987). We have also recognized that the communication of defamatory statements between agents of the same principal, arguably as between defendant and Burke, is a publication.<underline>Popko v. Continental Casualty Co.</underline>, <cross_reference>355 Ill. App. 3d 257</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>264-65</cross_reference> (2005); Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 577, Comment <italic>i</italic>, at 201-02 (1977). Additionally, the communication of defamatory material from a principal to his agent, as in an attorney-client relationship, also may be a publication. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 577, Comment <italic>e</italic>, at 203 (1977). Although such publications<page_number>Page 18</page_number>
may themselves be privileged, that does not affect the applicability of the fair report privilege. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 611, Comment<italic>c</italic>, at 299 (1977).

On the other hand, our research has revealed no support for the proposition that a verification constitutes a publication, nor has defendant provided us with any. The circuit court relied solely on section 1-109 of the Code to support its position; however, we are not convinced that the language of the statute alone brings a verification within the broad definition of a "publication." A section 1-109 verification is a communication to the court that the verifier attests, under penalty of perjury, that the statements contained in a pleading are true. <cross_reference>735 ILCS 5/1-109</cross_reference> (West 2006); 3 R. Michael, Illinois Practice ยง 23.7, at 326-27 (1989) ("Verification consists of an oath of the truthfulness of the pleading"). However, a verification does not stand on its own; it is submitted to the court along with the pleading to which it refers. That is, the statements being verified are not communicated until the pleading is filed with the court. Therefore, a verification is not, by itself, a publication.

Whether a verifier, or any other person, participated in the publication is a different, but related, question. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 617, Comment a, at 315 (1977). "All persons who cause or participate in the publication of [defamatory] matters are responsible for such publication." <underline>Van Home v. Muller</underline>, <cross_reference>185 Ill. 2d 299</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>308</cross_reference> (1998), quoting 33A Ill. L.  Prac. <italic>Slander and Libel</italic> ยง 83 (1970). In fact, in<underline>Van Home</underline>, the supreme court established that more than one person may be liable for defamation based on their participation in the publication.<underline>Van Home</underline>, <cross_reference>185 Ill. 2d at 308</cross_reference> (holding that plaintiff adequately alleged that a morning radio host and his sidekick "both participated in the publication" of the same defamatory story). Once<page_number>Page 19</page_number>
again, however, that question is reserved for the jury. <underline>Colmar v.</underline><underline>Greater Niles Township Publishing Corp.</underline>, <cross_reference>13 Ill. App. 2d 267</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>277</cross_reference>
(1957); Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 617, Comment a, at 315 (1977). Although a court may make that determination as a matter of law where the evidence is so overwhelming that it presents "with convincing clarity," the evidence in this case is far from convincing. Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 617, Comment a, at 315 (1977). Accordingly, the circuit court erred in deciding as a matter of law that Ficaro published the original defamatory statement through verification when that question belonged within the province of the jury.

Moreover, even if Ficaro's verification could be said to be a publication, that does not preclude the possibility that defendant and Burke also may be liable for that publication. See <underline>Van Home</underline>,<cross_reference>185 Ill. 2d at 308</cross_reference>; <underline>Catalano</underline>, <cross_reference>83 Ill. 2d at 168</cross_reference>. It follows that if either or both of them did participate in the publication of the original defamatory statements, the self-conferral exception would preclude them from enjoying the benefit of the fair report privilege as well. Here, the record contains some evidence that defendant and Burke participated in the publication. For example, Burke signed the Ficaro complaint and defendant testified that Burke filed it with the court.

Additionally, and for the purposes of this case, the original and amended Ficaro complaints list defendant as the lead attorney in Ficaro's defamation suit against the plaintiffs, with the signature block on those pleadings appearing as follows:<page_number>Page 20</page_number>

<bold>"</bold><bold><underline>ATTORNEYS FOR PLAINTIFF</underline></bold> Robert A. Clifford Richard F. Burke, Jr. Shannon M. McNulty CLIFFORD LAW OFFICES, P.C. 120 N. LaSalle Street, 31st Floor Chicago, Illinois 60602"

Defendant testified that although he infrequently signed any pleadings filed on behalf of his clients, it was not his firm's practice to include his name on all pleadings simply as a matter of course. Although he testified that he did not sign, review, or approve the content of the amended complaint before it was filed, he admitted that he was involved in planning meetings and discussions pertaining to "pleadings [that] were filed or to be filed" between the time of filing the original and amended Ficaro complaints. He also admitted that he was involved in strategy discussions regarding how to defend the amended Ficaro complaint after it was filed. He testified that he had the authority to withdraw a filed pleading that he felt was for any reason improper, although he did not do so in this case.

This evidence is sufficient to pose a question of fact as to whether defendant participated in the publication of the original defamatory statements, which publication may have occurred at the time the Ficaro complaint was filed or at another time determined by the jury. See <underline>Van</underline><underline>Home</underline>, <cross_reference>185 Ill. 2d at 308</cross_reference>; <underline>Colmar</underline>, <cross_reference>13 Ill. App. 2d at 277</cross_reference>. Additionally, the circuit court has already determined that a question of fact exists as to whether defendant was responsible for publishing the press statement. Therefore, we cannot say as a matter of law that the fair report privilege applies notwithstanding the self-conferral exception. The circuit court erred in granting<page_number>Page 21</page_number>
summary judgment in defendant's favor on this issue. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's order and remand for further proceedings.

Reversed and remanded.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Plaintiff's law partner, William Choslovsky, also was a plaintiff in the original complaint. However, Choslovsky later voluntarily dismissed the complaint as to himself and refiled a separate complaint.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> Plaintiff did not attach copies of the depositions to his response motion or cite to specific pages of the depositions. However, it appears that plaintiff tendered the depositions to the court in their entirety at the time of the hearing, although the transcript of the hearing is not included in the record. Nevertheless, defendant acknowledged in a later filing that plaintiff tendered copies of the depositions to the court and the court's order indicates that it did have the depositions before it at the time of disposition.</footnote_body>
