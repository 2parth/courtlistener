<syllabus>  RAILROADS, § 280<footnote_reference>[fn*]</footnote_reference> — <italic>weight and sufficiency of evidence as to</italic><italic>trespassing.</italic> Where plaintiff had a verdict and Judgment for personal injuries sustained while in between freight cars at a place in railroad yards which was an unpaved pathway, whether plaintiff climbed upon a coal car for the purpose of taking coal, or was attempting to pass between the cars, he was a trespasser, and defendant owed him no duty except to refrain from wilfully and wantonly injuring him, and as there was no evidence supporting this charge, the judgment could not stand (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1941, ch. 114, par. 72; Jones Ill. Stats. Ann. 114.106).
