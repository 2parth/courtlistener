<block_quote>    Shall Article <cross_reference>X</cross_reference> of the Constitution of Missouri be amended to limit yearly increases of total state revenues generated by new, increased, or broadened taxes, licenses and fees, including user fees, to twenty hundredths of one percent of the total state revenue during the prior fiscal year, unless approved by popular vote; make all increases in taxes, licenses, and fees, excluding user fees, by any political subdivision subject to voter approval; and prohibit the state from mandating tax increases on political subdivisions as a requirement for maintaining their corporate status or existing level of state funding?</block_quote>

See our Opinion Letter No. 194-93.

Pursuant to Section <cross_reference>116.334</cross_reference>, we approve the legal content and form of the proposed statement. Since our review of the statement is mandated by statute, no action we take with respect to such review should be construed as an endorsement of the petition or as the expression of any view regarding the objectives of its proponents.

Very truly yours,
