<opinion_text>Dear Secretary Carnahan:

This opinion letter responds to your request dated July 7, 2009, for our review under § <cross_reference>116.332</cross_reference>, RSMo, of the sufficiency as to form of an initiative petition, submitted by Theodis "Ted" Brown (version 2).

We conclude that the petition must be rejected for at least the following reasons:

<block_quote>  1. The petition is not in the form prescribed by § <cross_reference>116.040</cross_reference>, RSMo 2000.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. The petition does not contain "all matter which is to be deleted included in its proper place enclosed in brackets and all new matter shown underlined" as required pursuant to § <cross_reference>116.050</cross_reference>, RSMo 2000.</block_quote>

Because of our rejection of the form of the petition for the reasons stated above, we have not reviewed the petition to determine if additional deficiencies exist. Pursuant to § <cross_reference>116.332</cross_reference>.3, RSMo 2000, the Secretary of State is authorized to review this opinion and "make a final decision as to the approval or rejection of the form of the petition."

<block_quote>                                                         Very truly yours,</block_quote>
