<opinion_text>  This Court has been advised that the State Law Library will be able to make briefs filed in this Court available on line more quickly if the brief does not have to be first optically scanned by library personnel, but instead can be input directly from a computer disc or CD.

Therefore, in order to better utilize the time and resources of the State Law Library and in order to make briefs filed in this Court more readily available to the bench, bar and public via the State Law Library website,

IT IS ORDERED that Rule 23(b), M.R.APP.P., is amended by adding thereto a subparagraph (i) as follows:

<block_quote>  (i) Disc copy of briefs. There shall be included with original briefs filed under this Rule and under Rule 17, one copy of the brief saved to either a 3%" floppy disc or to a CD. This rule shall not apply to hand-written briefs or to those typed on a typewriter. Failure to include the disc or CD with the original brief shall not be grounds for dismissal or for refusal to file the brief.</block_quote>

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this amendment shall be applicable to briefs filed on and after April 1, 2003.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court give notice of this Order by mail to each clerk of the district court; to the Executive Director of the State Bar of Montana with a request that this Order be published in the next available issue of the Montana Lawyer and be posted to the Bar's website; to the State Law Librarian with the request that this Order website; and to Gregory J.
