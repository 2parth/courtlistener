<opinion_text>The Honorable Henry H. Boyce Prosecuting Attorney Third Judicial District 208 Main Street, Suite 31 Newport, AR 72112

Dear Mr. Boyce:

I am writing in response to your request for my opinion on the following questions:

<block_quote>  1. Is a party, either the state or the defendant, in a criminal case required to tender a witness fee and mileage to a lay witness?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. If the answer to question 1 is "yes," is the witness required to attend if the fee and mileage is not paid?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. If the party subpoenaing the witness is represented by the Public Defender Commission, are they required to pay the witness fee pursuant to A.C.A. <cross_reference>16-87-212</cross_reference>?</block_quote>

You report that these questions have arisen in a pending capital murder case in which defense counsel has questioned your payment of a $30 per diem witness fee, mileage and lodging for out-of-state witnesses. You request that I reply before a preliminary hearing scheduled for May 6, 2004.

<bold>RESPONSE</bold>

I regret that I am unable to answer these questions, which you report are corollary matters currently subject to adjudication by the circuit court in a pending murder trial. As a matter of long-standing practice, this executive office refrains from issuing opinions on matters subject to adjudication by a court in pending litigation. However, I can and will attach for your information a copy of Ark. Op. Att'y Gen. No. <cross_reference>91-301</cross_reference>, in which one of my predecessors opined on issues closely related to those set forth in your request.

Please let me know if I can be of assistance in any other respect.

Assistant Attorney General Jack Druff prepared the foregoing opinion, which I hereby approve.

Sincerely,

MIKE BEEBE Attorney General
