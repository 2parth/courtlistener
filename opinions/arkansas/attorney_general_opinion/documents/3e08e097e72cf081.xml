<opinion_text>The Honorable Jim Argue State Senator 5905 Forest Place #210 Little Rock, AR 72207-5245

Dear Senator Argue:

This is in response to your request for an opinion concerning how the nurseryman representative on the State Plant Board must be selected. Arkansas Code Annotated § <cross_reference>2-16-206</cross_reference> (Repl. 1996) provides in part: "(a) There is created and established a State Plant Board, hereinafter to be called `the board,' composed of sixteen (16) members, as follows: . . . (7) A nurseryman, actively engaged in the business, to be elected by the State Nurseryman's Association." With regard to this provision, you have presented the following questions:

<block_quote>  1. Must the person be elected by the State Nurseryman's Association or is it permissible for the association to make a nomination for appointment by the Governor?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. Is this a position that ultimately requires appointment by the Governor?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. If so, can the Governor require the association to submit the names of three candidates?</block_quote>

In my opinion, A.C.A. § <cross_reference>2-16-206</cross_reference>(a)(7) clearly provides that the nurseryman representative is to be elected by the State Nurseryman's Association.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> An answer to your second and third questions is therefore unnecessary.

The foregoing opinion, which I hereby approve, was prepared by Assistant Attorney General Warren T. Readnour.

Sincerely,

WINSTON BRYANT Attorney General

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> It should be noted that several members of the State Plant Board, including a "a practical cotton grower," "a practical rice grower," and two farmers, are to be appointed by the Governor. <underline>See</underline> A.C.A. § <cross_reference>2-16-206</cross_reference>. Other members, however, are to be elected by entities such as the State Horticultural Society, the Arkansas Seed Growers Association, the Arkansas Seed Dealers Association, and the State Nurseryman's Association. <italic>Id.</italic></footnote_body>
