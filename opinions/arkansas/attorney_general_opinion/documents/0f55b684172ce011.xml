Dear Representative Teague:

This is in response to your request for clarification of Opinion No. <cross_reference>90-148</cross_reference>, (copy enclosed) which concerns the necessity of a school district having a personnel policies committee if it has agreed to negotiate with an organization representing a majority of the teachers in the district.  See A.C.A. <cross_reference>16-17-202</cross_reference>.

Specifically, you reference the following sentence on page four of Opinion No. <cross_reference>90-148</cross_reference>.

<block_quote>          To the extent the district's agreement with PACT  does not cover some issues and some employees, personnel policies covering these employees and issues may be promulgated by the district alone.</block_quote>

Your question with reference to this sentence is whether the opinion suggests that the Pulaski County Special School District ("PCSSD") needs to establish a committee for non-certified employees such a bus drivers, food service workers, custodians, secretaries, aides, maintenance personnel and para-professionals etc. . . .

The answer to your question is "no".  This is exactly what the opinion does not suggest.  The opinion concludes that the school district may promulgate personnel policies for these non-certified employees without the necessity of a "personnel policies committee".

The foregoing opinion, which I hereby approve, was prepared by Assistant Attorney General Elana L. Cunningham.
