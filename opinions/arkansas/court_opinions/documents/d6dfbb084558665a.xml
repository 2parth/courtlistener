<posture>  Motion for Stay of Execution, Motion Moot.

</posture>
<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On April 5, 2010, Don W. Davis received a stay of execution from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. <italic>See Jones v. Hobbs</italic>, No. 5:10CV00065 (E.D. Ark.) (Document #53) (April 5, 2010). Because this stay is currently in effect, Davis's motion for a stay of execution before this court is moot.

WILLS, J., not participating.
