<posture>  Motion for Extension of time to Complete the Record, Granted.

</posture>
<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Misty Porter, through her attorney, Ronald L. Davis, Jr., petitions this court for a writ of certiorari directed to the court reporter to complete the record in this dependency-neglect case. Pursuant to this court's order of September 9, 2010, the clerk and court reporter of the Little River County Circuit Court were ordered to complete the transcript and record "forthwith." The record had to be completed and filed in this court no later than October 11, 2010. On October 7, 2010, Porter apprised this court by way of her petition for writ of certiorari that the court reporter needs an additional sixty days to complete the transcript.

The express purpose of the adoption of Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 6-9 was to expedite appeals in dependency-neglect cases.<italic>See Ratliff v. Ark. Dep't of Health  Human Servs.</italic>,<cross_reference>371 Ark. 534</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>268 S.W.3d 322</cross_reference> (2007). Our intent in the adoption of Rule 6-9 was to avoid the type of delay present in the case before us. While the entire delay in this case<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
may not be attributed to the court reporter, our September 9, 2010 order directed that the court reporter prepare the transcript forthwith, and it was to be included in the completed record to be filed in this court no later than October 11, 2010. The order was served on the clerk and the court reporter.

We grant the petition for writ of certiorari and order the court reporter to complete the transcript within thirty days of this opinion.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
