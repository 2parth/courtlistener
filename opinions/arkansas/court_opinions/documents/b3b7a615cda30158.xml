</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    On September 26, 1983, the Court created an Alternate Committee on Professional Conduct, to serve in the rare instances in which the members of the Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct consider themselves disqualified from participating in a matter before that Committee thereby enabling the Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct to refer the matter to the Alternate Committee.  The Alternate Committee was to establish staggered terms of three, four, five, six, and seven years for the lawyer members and terms of three and four years for the non-lawyer members.  Thereafter the terms were to be seven years for the lawyer members and four years for the non-lawyer members.

The Alternate Committee met only once, and there is some confusion regarding whether the members actually drew for the staggered terms.

Therefore, the following persons are appointed as members of the Alternate Committee to serve collectively or individually as the situation requires and are requested to draw for staggered terms as set forth above.  Thereafter the terms will be seven years for all Committee members.

First Congressional District: David Solomon, Esq., Helena
