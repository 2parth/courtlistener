<posture>  Appeal from the Union County Circuit Court, [CR-08-373-4], Honorable Harvey Lee Yates, Judge, Rebriefing Ordered.

</posture>
<opinion_byline>  RITA W. GRUBER, Judge.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  A Union County jury convicted Andrew Lovett of second-degree murder, felon in possession of a firearm, and a firearm enhancement, and sentenced him to consecutive sentences totaling sixty-eight years in prison. He brings two points on appeal: first, the trial court erred by allowing the State to question him about a prior manslaughter conviction; and, second, the trial court erred by allowing admission of a photograph of the victim. Because appellant's addendum is not in compliance with Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 4-2(a)(8)(A), we do not consider the appeal at this time and order rebriefing.

Rule 4-2(a)(8)(A) requires the addendum to contain the order "from which the appeal is taken." Here, the addendum contains only a portion of the First Amended Judgment and Commitment Order. We also note that the record in this case contains a Second Amended Judgment and Commitment Order, none of which is included in the addendum. We are<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
compelled by the Arkansas Supreme Court's requirement to order rebriefing when key documents are missing from the addendum. <italic>See</italic><italic>Fowler v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>2010 Ark. App. 811</cross_reference>.

We order appellant to cure the deficiency by filing a substituted brief, abstract, and addendum within fifteen days from the date of this opinion. Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 4-2(b)(3). We encourage appellate counsel to review Rules 4-2 and 4-3 to ensure that the substituted brief complies with the rules and that no additional deficiencies are present. In the event appellant fails to file a complying brief within the requisite time period, the judgment may be affirmed for noncompliance with the rule. <italic>Id.</italic>

Rebriefing ordered.

ROBBINS and BROWN, JJ., agree.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
