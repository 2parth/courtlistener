<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On January 10, 2008, we issued a per curiam order setting out proposed revisions to the policies and procedures followed by the Arkansas Lawyers Assistance Program. We sought comment from the bench and the bar. No comments have been received by the Clerk of the Court.

We find the proposed changes in the policies and procedures to be appropriate. These new policies and procedures will more correctly reflect the day-to-day activities, responsibilities, and other procedures attendant to the effective operation of the program.

We adopt the attached document titled "Arkansas Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program — Procedure Manual." As noted in the forward to that manual, the program shall henceforth be designated as the Arkansas Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program, or JLAP.

The Arkansas Supreme Court established the Arkansas Lawyers Assistance Program (ALAP) as a program which assists and supports judges and lawyers in overcoming physical or mental disabilities that result from disease, substance abuse, disorder, trauma, or age that impair their ability to practice or serve (impairments). The Arkansas Lawyers Assistance Program Committee (Committee) was appointed by the Arkansas Supreme Court to fulfill the purposes of the program, which are:

<block_quote>  to protect the interests of clients, litigants, and the general public from the harm caused by impaired judges and lawyers;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  to assist impaired members of the legal profession to begin and continue to recover; and,</block_quote>

<block_quote>  to educate the bench and bar to the causes of and remedies for impairment affecting members of the legal profession.</block_quote>

The Committee shall develop the necessary documents to administer the program. This Procedure Manual will replace the previous manual adopted by per curiam order of this Court on December 31, 2001. To more properly reflect the population served by the program, throughout the new manual the program is designated Arkansas Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program (JLAP).<page_number>Page 3</page_number>

<heading><bold>1. BACKGROUND</bold></heading>
The Arkansas Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program (JLAP) was established by the Arkansas Supreme Court to be effective January 1, 2001. The Court appointed nine (9) committee members, including three (3) citizens who are not members of the legal profession. The members have diverse experience, knowledge and a demonstrated competence in the physical and mental health conditions that negatively affect a lawyer or judge in the practice of their profession and quality of life.

The Court appoints the Chair of the Committee. The powers and duties of the Committee are:

<block_quote>  to establish Arkansas JLAP policies and procedures consistent with the purposes of the program;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  to oversee the management of the program to achieve the stated purposes; and,</block_quote>

<block_quote>  to assure the implementation of the Arkansas JLAP program in compliance with the Arkansas Supreme Court per curiam Order of December 7, 2000.</block_quote>

The procedures and policies set forth in this manual are cumulative to and explanatory of the per curiam order of December 7, 2000. In the event of conflict between these procedures and the per curiam order, the provisions of the per curiam order shall prevail.

<block_quote>  <bold>2. PROGRAM GOALS AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES</bold></block_quote><page_number>Page 5</page_number>

Arkansas JLAP's program goals are:

<block_quote>  2. To identify the impaired lawyer or judge who is practicing in the state of Arkansas;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. To assist judges and lawyers in their personal recovery from physical or mental health conditions that affect competent practice of their profession and their quality of life;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  4. To assist the families of judges and lawyers during their personal recovery from identified physical or mental health conditions;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  5. To educate the legal community on identification, assessment, referral, treatment, and community based resources available to meet the needs of affected judges and lawyers;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  6. To monitor and assist judges and lawyers while they return to the practice of law or to the bench; and,</block_quote>

<block_quote>  7. To establish and maintain a cooperative relationship with the legal community.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. Addiction, mental health concerns, physical disabilities and aging are treatable conditions;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. Addiction, mental health concerns, physical disabilities and aging should not be ignored or left untreated;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  4. Impaired judges and lawyers are obligated to seek assistance and to participate in services necessary to renew their full effectiveness as a lawyer, judge and family member; and,</block_quote>

<block_quote>  5. Every licensed lawyer and judge has the ethical responsibility to recognize the signs and symptoms of a colleague who might be impaired and to assist the colleague in accessing appropriate services.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  1. Any licensed lawyer or judge may voluntarily self-refer;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. Referrals are accepted from any individual who has observed behaviors indicating impairment or have information that may place public health, welfare, or safety at risk;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  4. Basic information will be taken by telephone or in person from the referral source to establish "pending status";</block_quote>

<heading><bold>D. INVESTIGATION OF SUSPECTED IMPAIRMENT</bold></heading><block_quote>  1. The objective of investigating suspected impairment of a lawyer or judge is to gather accurate information from individuals who have concern for the health of the lawyer or judge. All efforts to gather information are discrete and confidential;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. When an investigation produces insufficient indication of impairment, the lawyer or judge is classified as "non-participant status" but the file is maintained indefinitely should new information be obtained;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  5. The participant is offered the opportunity to participate in a health monitoring program to assure compliance with treatment goals.</block_quote>
 <bold>E. HEALTH MONITORING CONTRACTS</bold>

<block_quote>  A Health Monitoring Contract is a tool for maintaining treatment goals. Both addiction and mental health contracts monitor the participant's personal responsibility for achieving the desired goals and provide documentation of the accomplishments. Health Monitoring Contracts are individualized for each participant and are maintained for a minimum of three (3) years. Quarterly meetings with Arkansas JLAP staff verify compliance and serve as an ongoing supportive tool for the participating lawyer or judge.</block_quote><page_number>Page 7</page_number>

Statistical information is maintained indefinitely.

<bold>8. CONFIDENTIALITY</bold>

Counselors assist in making appropriate referral arrangements for the continuation of treatment, when necessary, during interruptions such as vacations and following termination of services; and,</block_quote>

Disbarment:

<block_quote>  Should an Arkansas JLAP participant be disbarred during the course of treatment, the Arkansas JLAP staff will continue to provide transitional services consistent with the requirements of their professional licensing board with regards to proper termination of services.
