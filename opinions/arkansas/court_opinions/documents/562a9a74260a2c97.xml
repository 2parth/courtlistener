<opinion_byline>    PER CURIAM

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    Petitioner, Jerry Wayne Baumgarner, has filed herein a petition, which we treat as a writ of certiorari, seeking to overturn the trial court's ruling that an indictment for first degree rape is not a bailable offense. Since Furman v. Georgia, <cross_reference>408 U.S. 238</cross_reference> (1972), the death penalty cannot, under our present law, be assessed â€” thus the maximum penalty assessable is a life sentence. In Walker v. State,<cross_reference>137 Ark. 402</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>209 S.W. 86</cross_reference> (1919), we held that a life sentence is a bailable offense under Art. 2, 8. Consequently, the trial court erroneously held that the offense here was not bailable. See Graham v. State, <cross_reference>253 Ark. 462</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>486 S.W.2d 678</cross_reference>, and State v. Johnson, <cross_reference>61 N.J. 351</cross_reference>, 294 So.2d 245 (1972).

Reversed and remanded to trial court with directions to fix bail.<page_number>Page 724</page_number>
