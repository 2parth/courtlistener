<opinion_text><center>[1]                        <underline>OPINION AND ORDER</underline></center>
[2] The respondent appeals an opinion and order filed by the administrative law judge on January 19, 1994. In that opinion and order, the administrative law judge found that the claimant is entitled to additional temporary total disability compensation for the period extending from May 1, 1994 through June 30, 1994. In addition, the administrative law judge found that the respondent is liable for treatment provided by Dr. Belknap, Dr. Meador, and Dr. Smelz.

[3] After conducting a <underline>de novo</underline> review of the entire record, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to additional temporary total disability compensation, and we find that she failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the treatment provided by Dr. Belknap, Dr. Meador, or Dr. Smelz was reasonably necessary for treatment of her compensable injury. Therefore, we find that the administrative law judge's decision must be reversed.

[4] The claimant was employed by the respondent as a nurse's aide. On November 25, 1993, the claimant and two nurses were assisting a patient to bed when the patient pushed against the claimant because she thought she was falling, and the claimant moved to prevent the patient from falling. As a result of this incident, the claimant began experiencing pain in her left hip which progressively worsened, causing her to seek treatment at the emergency room on November 27, 1993. Reports from the emergency room indicate that she was tender over the trochanter of the left hip. However, no neurological deficits were revealed, and the report indicates that she had full range of motion of the left hip. The claimant previously had rods placed in femur bones of both legs due to fractures sustained during a vehicular accident, and x-rays taken on November 30, 1993, showed some calcification in the area of the trochanteric notch, which the radiologist, Dr. Clyde Glover, opined was related to the prior placement of the intramedullary rod. Based on these findings, trochanteric bursitis of the left hip was diagnosed, and she was treated conservatively.

[5] However, the claimant continued to complain of severe pain, and due to the severity of her complaints, she was referred to Dr. Reed Kilgore, an orthopedic specialist. Dr. Reed first saw the claimant on December 6, 1993, and his examination also revealed tenderness over the trochanter as well as some tenderness in the abductor musculature and tendon. Otherwise, his examination was normal. Consequently, he diagnosed trochanteric bursitis and abductor tendinitis, and he injected the trochanteria and prescribed physical therapy. His reports indicate that the claimant continued to complain of severe pain in her left hip, and his reports indicate that she ultimately complained of pain radiating down her leg and of numbness in her toes. Dr. Reed's clinical examination did reveal some tenderness over the sciatic notch, which caused him to suspect "some degree of sciatica or irritation of the structures of the sciatic notch; however, other than pain in the sciatic notch, his examination did not reveal any evidence of nerve root syndrome which was consistent with the claimant's subjective complaints of radicular pain.

[6] On January 11, 1994, Dr. Reed released the claimant to return to work for four hour shifts, and he indicated at that time that he would release her to full work duties in two weeks. However, when she returned to him on January 20, 1994, she was complaining of additional pain and numbness radiating down her leg and into her foot. However, his clinical examination still did not reveal any definite radicular signs. Nevertheless, he ordered a MRI to rule out any type of disc pathology, but this study was "completely normal." Consequently, on January 28, 1994, Dr. Reed again released her to return to work "at half time for one week, and then back to regular duty." The record is not clear regarding whether the claimant attempted to return to work at that time. However, she continued to see Dr. Reed complaining of pain. In this regard, Dr. Reed made the following comments after examining the claimant on February 24, 1994:

<block_quote>     Sherri is doing a little better. She continues to have pain primarily in the buttock, at times radiates down the leg, but overall she seems improved Clinically, I can find no objective changes in physical exam.</block_quote>

<block_quote>     She has negative straight leg raising. I feel that she should be able to return to work by now, based on the probability that her symptoms are simply from muscular strain.</block_quote>

<block_quote>     I've informed her that I would suspect that she probably should have some pain, even when she returns to work, but it shouldn't do her any physical harm, to try to do her regular duties. She will return as needed.</block_quote>

[7] Likewise, in a report dated April 22, 1994, Dr. Reed continued to opine that the claimant should return to her regular work duties. In this regard, he made the following comments:<block_quote>. . . I feel like her problem is basically related to chronic musculotendinous strain in the gluteal musculature. I really can't explain how her pain can radiate all the way to the foot, but it is apparent that her pain level becomes high enough that it tends to be referred down the leg. I have reinforced the fact that she should continue to try to increase her activity level, do the exercises as instructed and lose weight. I believe that she should try to work at regular duty as I don't think any further inactivity is going to improve her. She continues not to have any improvement, even when off work, and I think as long as she doesn't do anything to aggravate her pain, I think she should be able to work without causing harm. I told her she can return here as needed.</block_quote>

[8] Due to the claimant's chronic complaints, she was also referred to Dr. Steven L. Cathey, a neurosurgeon, for an evaluation. Dr. Cathey's neurological examination was essentially normal, and he concluded that there was nothing "to suggest sciatica, nerve root impingement, disc herniation or other significant low back problems. Consequently, he diagnosed musculoskeletal pain, bursitis, and possible sacroiliac inflammation on the left. In addition, he opined that the claimant "should be allowed to go back to work without restrictions whenever she feels she can handle herself there."

[9] The claimant did attempt to return to work after she was released by Dr. Reed at the end of April of 1993. However, on May 1, 1993, she began to experience a burning sensation in her left hip, and her supervisor sent her to the emergency room. Based on her complaints, the emergency room physician advised her to remain off work for a period of time. However, the respondent employer subsequently contacted her and advised her that her temporary total disability compensation was being terminated as of April 28, 1994, and that they would not authorize any further medical treatment. The claimant then sought treatment on her own initiative from Dr. Melvin Belknap, a general practitioner and the claimant's primary care physician. Similar to the findings of the other physicians who had seen the claimant, Dr. Belknap's May 5, 1994, office note indicates that she was tender over the left sciatic notch and over the left hip, but no other positive findings are noted. Nevertheless, Dr. Belknap referred the claimant to Dr. Annette Meador, an anesthesiologist specializing in pain control. Although the claimant indicated that Dr. Meador treated her periodically through June 30, 1993, the only evidence of Dr. Meador's treatment found in the record is her report of her initial evaluation of the claimant on May 12, 1994. This report indicates that Dr. Meador's clinical findings were consistent with the findings of the other physicians who had treated the claimant, and she also diagnosed sacroiliac strain, trochanteric/obturator internus bursitis, and myofascial pain. Dr. Meador recommended a series of trigger point injections, but she also referred the claimant to Dr. Johnny Smelz, a physiatrist, prior to implementing these injections. Dr. Meador released the claimant to return to work on June 30, 1994, without restrictions.

[10] The claimant also indicated that she was under Dr. Smelz's care for an extended period of time; however, again, the only evidence of Dr. Smelz's treatment is found in his report of his initial evaluation of the claimant on May 19, 1994. Dr. Smelz's clinical findings and diagnosis were also consistent with the findings and diagnoses of the other physicians who treated the claimant.

[11] Initially, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to temporary total disability compensation beyond April 28, 1994. This Commission has a statutory duty to decide the issues before it by determining whether the party having the burden of proof on an issue has established it by a preponderance of the evidence. Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-704</cross_reference>
(c)(2) (1987); <underline>see, Gencorp Polymer Products v. Landers,</underline><cross_reference>36 Ark. App. 190</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>820 S.W.2d 475</cross_reference> (1991). In determining whether the party having the burden of proof on an issue has established it by a preponderance of the evidence, we must weigh the evidence impartially, without giving the benefit of the doubt to either party. Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-704</cross_reference>
(c)(4) (1987); <underline>Wade v. Mr. C. Cavenaugh's,</underline> <cross_reference>198 Ark. 363</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>768 S.W.2d 521</cross_reference> (1989); <underline>Fowler v. McHenry,</underline> <cross_reference>22 Ark. App. 196</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>737 S.W.2d 633</cross_reference> (1987). In this regard, the claimant has the burden of establishing her entitlement to the compensation sought by a preponderance of the evidence. <underline>Bates v. Frost</underline><underline>Logging Co.,</underline> <cross_reference>38 Ark. App. 36</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>827 S.W.2d 664</cross_reference> (1992); <underline>Lybrand</underline><underline>v. Arkansas Oak Flooring Company,</underline> <cross_reference>266 Ark. 946</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>588 S.W.2d 449</cross_reference> (1979); <underline>Bates, supra.</underline>

[12] Temporary disability is determined by the extent to which a compensable injury has affected the claimant's ability to earn a livelihood. An injured employee is entitled to temporary total disability compensation during the period of time that she is within her healing period and totally incapacitated to earn wages. <underline>Arkansas State Highway</underline><underline>and Transportation Department v. Breshears,</underline> <cross_reference>272 Ark. 244</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>613 S.W.2d 392</cross_reference> (1981). An injured employee is entitled to temporary partial disability compensation during the period that she is within her healing period and suffers only a decrease in her capacity to earn the wages that she was receiving at the time of the injury. <underline>Id.</underline> The "healing period" is defined as the period necessary for the healing of an injury resulting from an accident. Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference> (6) (1987). The healing period continues until the employee is as far restored as the permanent character of his injury will permit. When the underlying condition causing the disability becomes stable and when nothing further will improve that condition, the healing period has ended, and the claimant is no longer entitled to receive temporary total disability compensation or temporary partial disability compensation, regardless of her physical capabilities. Moreover, the persistence of pain is not sufficient in itself to extend the healing period or to find that the claimant is totally incapacitated from earning wages. <underline>Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker,</underline> <cross_reference>4 Ark. App. 124</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>628 S.W.2d 582</cross_reference> (1982).

[13] In the present claim, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she remained in her healing period beyond April 28, 1994. The physical findings discovered by the physicians who have treated the claimant have been consistent from the outset, and these findings have not been consistent with the nature nor the severity of the claimant's subjective complaints. Dr. Reed's records indicate that he felt that she was able to return to work by the middle of January of 1994, and he continued to opine that she was able to return to work in subsequent reports. Likewise, Dr. Cathey opined that the claimant should be able to return to work after his examination of the claimant. Furthermore, while the claimant's subsequent alleged inability to return to work was based on the discomfort that she experienced when she did so, Dr. Reed had previously advised her that she would experience some pain when she first attempted to return to work. While Dr. Meador did take the claimant off work in May of 1994, Dr. Meador did not have the benefit of the prior medical records related to the claimant's treatment. Moreover, the initial findings of Dr. Meador and Dr. Smelz were consistent with the findings of the previous physicians who had seen the claimant, and due to the lack of any subsequent evidence related to the treatment provided by Dr. Meador or Dr. Smelz, we are unable to conclude that either physician discovered any findings or provided any treatment which suggested that the claimant's condition had not stabilized prior to the time they began treating the claimant.

[14] In short, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the claimant either sustained a strain type injury to her hip or aggravated a preexisting hip condition. However, the preponderance of the evidence also indicates that this condition became stable and that there was no further treatment that would improve the underlying condition at least by April 28, 1994. Therefore, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to additional temporary total disability compensation.

[15] In addition, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the treatment provided by Dr. Belknap, Dr. Meador, or Dr. Smelz was reasonably necessary for treatment of the compensable injury. Employers must promptly provide medical services which are reasonably necessary for treatment of compensable injuries. Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-508</cross_reference> (a) (1987). However, injured employees have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that medical treatment is reasonably necessary for treatment of the compensable injury. <underline>Norma Beatty v. Ben Pearson, Inc.,</underline> Full Workers' Compensation Commission, Feb. 17, 1989 (Claim No. <cross_reference>D612291</cross_reference>). In assessing whether a given medical procedure is reasonably necessary for treatment of the compensable injury, we analyze both the proposed procedure and the condition it is sought to remedy. <underline>Deborah Jones v. Seba, Inc.,</underline> Full Workers' Compensation Commission, Dec. 13, 1989 (Claim No.<cross_reference>D511255</cross_reference>).

[16] As discussed, the record in the present claim does not contain any evidence of the treatment provided by Dr. Meador or Dr. Smelz other than the initial evaluation of each physician. Moreover, these records indicate that the findings of each physician was consistent with the physicians who previously treated the claimant, and each physician merely suggests treatment which is essentially similar to treatment previously provided to the claimant. Consequently, we cannot find that the greater weight of the evidence supports a conclusion that either physician provided treatment that was reasonably necessary for treatment of the claimant's compensable injury. Likewise, the claimant's testimony indicates that she went to Dr. Belknap solely to obtain a referral to another physician, and his records do not indicate that he provided any treatment. Therefore, we find that the claimant also failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Belknap provided any care that was reasonably necessary for treatment of the compensable injury.

[17] Accordingly, based on our <underline>de novo</underline> review of the entire record, and for the reasons discussed herein, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to additional temporary total disability compensation, and we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the care provided by Dr. Meador, Dr. Smelz, or Dr. Belknap was reasonably necessary for treatment of the compensable injury. Therefore, we find that the administrative law judge's decision must be, and hereby is, reversed. In reaching our decision, we recognize that the provisions of<cross_reference>Act 796 of 1993</cross_reference> apply to this claim. However, we would point out that those provisions do not affect the result of this decision. This claim is hereby denied and dismissed.

[18] IT IS SO ORDERED.
