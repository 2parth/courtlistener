[2] This matter comes on for review from Respondent's Motion to Remand. After carefully considering respondent's motion, claimant's response thereto, and all matters properly before the Full Commission, we grant respondent's motion.

[3] A hearing was held to determine whether claimant is entitled to benefits related to wage loss disability. After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge awarded claimant a 5% to the body as a whole related to wage loss disability in addition to the 2% permanent anatomical impairment rating accepted by respondent. Subsequent to the issuing of the opinion and order, respondent filed a Petition for Clarification. The Administrative Law Judge did not act on the Petition for Clarification within 30 days. During this same time period, respondent filed a Notice of Appeal and claimant cross-appealed.

[4] Furthermore, a review of the file indicates that there is nothing in the file to show that claimant has any objections to respondent's motion.

[5] Respondent filed this Motion for Remand. A review of the evidence indicates that the permanent partial disability award assessed by the Administrative Law Judge amounts to $3,808.80. Respondent maintains that they paid $5,297.60 and are requesting that the Administrative Law Judge make a specific determination as to whether or not they are entitled to a credit and liability for attorney's fees. These are relevant issues which should have been determined by the Administrative Law Judge at the time of the hearing. Therefore, we remand this matter back to the Administrative Law Judge so that she can make a determination on these issues. If necessary, we direct her to hold a subsequent hearing.

[6] IT IS SO ORDERED.

[9] I must respectfully dissent from the order of the majority remanding this matter to an Administrative Law Judge.

[10] The issue at the hearing concerned claimant's entitlement to benefits for wage loss disability. The Administrative Law Judge awarded such benefits in an amount equal to 5% to the body as a whole. Respondent has now filed a motion to remand for a determination as to whether it is entitled to a credit for overpayment of temporary total disability benefits.

[11] As far as I can tell, there has never been a stipulation by the parties or a determination by the Commission as to the end of claimant's healing period and the extent of temporary total disability benefits paid by respondent. Thus, there is no evidence, other than the bald assertion by counsel for respondent, that over $5,200.00 in benefits have been paid. Respondent certainly did not prove that it was entitled to a credit against any award of permanent disability benefits. Therefore, I would deny respondent's motion to remand simply because respondent failed to prove that it was entitled to a credit.

[12] For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.

[13] PAT WEST HUMPHREY, Commissioner
