<opinion_text><center>[1]                        <underline>OPINION AND ORDER</underline></center>
[2] In an opinion filed February 27, 1997, the Administrative Law Judge held that the claimant proved that she sustained a compensable gradual onset injury in the form of carpal tunnel syndrome while employed by the respondent. The claimant was awarded the costs of reasonably necessary medical treatment in relation to her carpal tunnel syndrome, but denied her claim for temporary total disability benefits.  Based upon our <underline>de novo</underline>
review of the record, which includes a videotape of the claimant's job duties while employed with the respondent, we find that the claimant met her burden of proof in regard to the compensability of her claim.  Accordingly, we affirm the Administrative Law Judge's decision.

[3] The respondent contends on appeal, as they did below, that the claimant failed to prove that she sustained a compensable injury while employed by the respondent.  The respondent specifically contends on appeal that: the claimant failed to prove that her employment with the respondent was the "major cause" of her carpal tunnel syndrome; she failed to prove her injury arose out of and during the course of her employment; and, the claimant failed to prove that her job duties with the respondent were rapid and repetitive in nature.  The claimant contends on appeal that she met her burden of proof and that the Administrative Law Judge's decision should be affirmed.

[4] <cross_reference>Act 796 of 1993</cross_reference> is applicable to the facts of this case as the claimant contends she sustained a compensable injury after July 1, 1993.  Because the claimant contends that she sustained a gradual onset injury in the form of carpal tunnel syndrome, and not an injury from a specific incident, the claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she sustained an "injury causing internal or external harm to the body and arising out of and in the course of employment."  Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(A)(ii) (Repl. 1996).  The claimant must also prove that the gradual onset injury of carpal tunnel syndrome was "caused by rapid repetitive motion," and that the "compensable injury is the major cause of the disability or need for treatment." Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(A)(ii)(a) (Repl. 1996); Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(E)(ii) (Repl. 1996).  What constitutes rapid repetitive motion is a question of fact for the Commission to resolve, and such decisions must be determined on a case by case basis.

[5] The respondent argues in their first point on appeal that the claimant failed to offer medical evidence to prove that her work was the "major cause" of her carpal tunnel syndrome.  As the claimant correctly points out in her brief, the statute in question states that the claimant must prove that the "compensable injury is the major cause of the disability or need for treatment." Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(E)(ii) (Repl. 1996).  As this Commission has previously pointed out, "this issue is properly stated in terms of whether claimant's <underline>injury</underline> was the major cause of her disability or need for treatment." <underline>Nancy Sexton</underline><underline>v. First Brands Corporation</underline>, Workers' Compensation Commission, Opinion filed September 24, 1996 (<cross_reference>E416667</cross_reference>).

[6] The evidence in this case indicated that the claimant had no problems with her wrists prior to her employment with the respondent.  While the dissent is correct that the claimant's problems began to develop shortly after beginning her employment with the respondent, the problems apparently did not <underline>totally</underline>
manifest themselves until several months later.  This makes this case clearly distinguishable from the case cited by the dissent,<underline>April Lee v. The Mad Butcher</underline>, Workers' Compensation Commission, Opinion filed April 8, 1997 (<cross_reference>E507850</cross_reference>).  As the dissent points out, Ms. Lee's problems became "severe" in a brief time which was held as not being a result of her work related duties.  In the present case the claimant simply began to experience problems in January and continued to perform the duties in question for the next seven months before her problems became severe enough to seek treatment, receiving the diagnosis some eight months after her initial complaints. Also, while the dissent attempts to indicate that the initial problems were simply fatigue or related to a previous motor vehicle accident, pointing to Tracy Darden's testimony, Ms. Darden testified that she gave the claimant wrist splints after the claimant complained of problems.  This contradicts the dissent's implication that the problems in January were simply a result of fatigue or some other non-work related problem.

[7] No evidence was introduced by the respondent to show that there is some reason, other than her work related duties, which required the claimant to need the treatment in question, carpal tunnel release surgery.  We in no way intend to imply that simply diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome satisfies the "major cause" requirement of the statute.  However, we would point out that the medical evidence in this case is clear that the carpal tunnel syndrome is the only reason that the claimant is in "need of treatment," and that her work related duties which caused the carpal tunnel syndrome are the only reason she needs the surgery. The claimant offered objective medical evidence in the form of nerve conduction studies that clearly indicate she has bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  We find that the claimant met her burden of proof on this issue.

[8] The respondent argues in their second point on appeal that the claimant failed to show that her carpal tunnel syndrome arose "out of and in the course of" her employment. <underline>See</underline> Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(A)(ii) (Repl. 1996).  The respondent contends that the claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome could be a result of her employment prior to or subsequent to her employment with the respondent.  We disagree.  As pointed out above, the evidence indicates that the claimant had had no problems with her wrists prior to her employment with the respondent, beginning her employment with the respondent in November of 1995 as an assistant manager.  The claimant did not complain about any wrist problems until late January 1996.  The claimant's supervisor, Traci Darden, was informed that the claimant was experiencing numbness, burning sensations, and weakness in her hands.  The claimant supervisor testified that the claimant was given a wrist brace shortly thereafter to help isolate some of the wrist movements required by her employment.  The claimant ended her employment with the respondent in July 1996, due to being told that there would be no room for advancement with the respondent.  The evidence indicated that the claimant had not done any type of hand intensive employment prior to her employment with the respondent, working only as a cashier and quality control person in the past.  While we would acknowledge that Dr. Paul L Raby, in his report of August 29, 1996, was unable to state affirmatively whether or not the claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome was a direct result of her employment specifically with the respondent, such definite proof is not essential to prove compensability.  All of the evidence in this case shows that this was the only extremely hand intensive job that the claimant has ever held, and that the claimant had never suffered from any hand and wrist problems prior to her employment with the respondent.  The respondent failed to rebut this proof with any evidence that something other than the claimant's employment with the respondent could have caused her condition.  We find that the claimant met her burden of proof on this issue.

[9] The respondent contends in their final point on appeal that the claimant failed to prove her employment duties were rapid and repetitive in nature, relying extensively on the <underline>Throckmorton</underline>
case.  The Arkansas Court of Appeals has recently discussed carpal tunnel syndrome in the case of <underline>Kildow v. Baldwin Piano  Organ</underline>,<cross_reference>58 Ark. App. 194</cross_reference>, ___ S.W.2d ___ (1997).  The Court reiterated its ruling in <underline>Baysinger v. Air Systems</underline>, <cross_reference>55 Ark. App. 174</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>934 S.W.2d 230</cross_reference> (1996), that carpal tunnel syndrome does not require that the claimant proved she was performing the "exact, or almost exactly, the same movement again and again," ruling that the Commission's decision in <underline>Throckmorton v. J  J Metals</underline>, Workers' Compensation Commission, Opinion filed August 14, 1995 (<cross_reference>E405318</cross_reference>), is erroneous as a matter of law.  The court held in <underline>Baysinger</underline> that carpal tunnel syndrome can be compensable even if it is a result of various multiple tasks and not the same task over and over again.<underline>Kildow, supra</underline>, went on to define rapid in its "ordinary usage" as meaning "swift or quick."

[10] The evidence in this case indicated that the claimant's job duties with the respondent were hand intensive.  The claimant, who's testimony was corroborated by her supervisor, testified that for approximately the first three hours of the day, and one hour in the afternoon, she was required to scoop frozen cookie dough to form cookies and place the cookies on a sheet for baking.  She testified as follows:

<block_quote>     You get a handful of cookie dough in your hand, in your left hand or right hand, depending on which is your most dominant, and what was used mostly was an ice cream scoop in the right hand. You would drag the scoop along your hand to fill the scoop with cookie dough and then you squeezed the handle to get the dough out.</block_quote>

[11] The videotape of this process shows an extremely rapid and hand intensive twisting of both wrist several times in order to scoop out one cookie from the frozen clump of dough, a process that was repeated over and over for several hours each day.  The claimant was also required to place M  Ms in certain types of cookies and roll others in sugar, another rapid and repetitive process as shown on the videotape.

[12] The videotape and testimony also indicated that another major part of the claimant's duties required her to roll out cookie dough into various sizes of frames or templates.  This required the claimant to roll the dough out using the heel of the palm of her hand and roll the dough out smoothly into the frame. As can clearly be seen on the videotape, this duty also required the claimant to use a rapid and repetitive motion to smooth out the dough.  The videotape shows that the amount of force and the twisting of the wrists necessary to smooth out the frozen cookie dough was extremely hand intensive, a process that can clearly lead to carpal tunnel syndrome as we find it was the cause in this case.

[13] The third major part of the claimant's duties required her to decorate the large cookies in various ways, depending on the season or the specific requests made by the customers.  The claimant testified as follows while the videotape was reviewed during the hearing below:

<block_quote>     On decorating like that, you have to keep the top twisted to where all of the frosting is down in the bottom of the bag; and to get it out of the bag you have to give it a firm, consistent pressure to squeeze it out of the bag. You can see her twisting it as she goes, because you don't want any air; it makes a mess.</block_quote>

[14] Once again, as one can clearly see from the videotape, the decorating required the claimant to use a pastry bag filled with thick, cold, stiff icing, squeezing the bag while maintaining a tight grip and applying constant pressure to force the icing to come out.  As the videotape clearly shows, the decorating required a lot of wrist twisting in a rapid and repetitive manner due to the great amount of icing required on the large cookies and due to the details required when icing.

[15] We find that the evidence presented showed that the various job duties performed by the claimant were rapid and repetitive in nature.  Although the claimant did not perform the same duties all day long, each of the duties as shown on the videotape required extremely hand intensive work that was performed in a rapid and repetitive manner for several hours each day. <underline>See Baysinger v Air Systems, supra</underline>. Accordingly, we find that the claimant met her burden of proving that her carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by rapid repetitive motion as a result of her work related duties with the respondent, and that her carpal tunnel syndrome was the major cause of her need for release surgery.  Therefore, we affirm the Administrative Law Judge's decision in this case.

[16] All accrued benefits shall be paid in a lump sum without discount and with interest thereon at the lawful rate from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision in accordance with Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-809</cross_reference> (Repl. 1996).

[17] For prevailing on this appeal before the Commission, the claimant's attorney is hereby awarded an additional attorney's fee in the amount of $250.00 as provided by Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-715</cross_reference>(b) (Repl. 1996).

[18] IT IS SO ORDERED.

</dissent_byline><dissent_text><center>[20]                       <underline>DISSENTING OPINION</underline></center>
[21] I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion finding that claimant sustained compensable carpal tunnel syndrome while employed by respondent.  Based upon my <underline>de novo</underline> review of the entire record, I find that claimant has failed to meet her burden of proof.

[22] Claimant was hired by respondent in November of <cross_reference>31995</cross_reference>. The record reflects that during the month of December claimant did not work very often due to her fiancee being hospitalized during that time frame.  Thus, it was not until January of 1996 that claimant worked for respondent on a continuous regular employment basis.  It is claimant's testimony that towards the end of January 1996 she began to experience numbness and tingling in both upper extremities and that she reported same to her supervisor, Tracy Darden.  Ms. Darden's testimony, however, indicates that claimant advised her of fatigue in her upper extremities, a symptom which Ms. Darden has also.  Ms. Darden provided claimant with wrist splints which she, herself, used to combat the fatigue.  Claimant continued to work for respondent until July of 1996 when she voluntarily terminated her employment after being advised that there was no room for advancement within the company.  Claimant did not seek medical attention for her complaints until late August, 1996.

[23] For gradual onset injuries, the Act requires a claimant to prove that the compensable injury was the major cause of the disability or need for treatment.

[24] Claimant's claim is a rapid repetitive motion injury. We have held on numerous occasions that a claimant must prove that her rapid repetitive motion job duties, not the actual ultimate diagnosed condition, were the major cause of claimant's disability.  <underline>Lucas v. Maybelline</underline>, F.C. Opinion 6-11-97 (<cross_reference>E402212</cross_reference>);<underline>Patterson v. Cantrell Service Station</underline>, F.C. Opinion 11-8-95 (<cross_reference>E406431</cross_reference>) affirmed by Court of Appeals March 5, 1997, unpublished opinion.  The requirement of "major cause" goes to claimant's rapid repetitive work, not claimant's physical condition.  It is the work which must be the major cause of the ultimate physical condition. <underline>Rascoe v. Stone Container</underline>, F.C. Opinion 6-11-97 (<cross_reference>E51012</cross_reference>).

[25] In finding that the major cause element has been met, the majority has misinterpreted the requirements of the Act that actually defines "compensable injury" as an injury (not caused by a specific incident) which is "caused by rapid repetitive motion." Consequently, the analysis applied by the majority fails to consider the Act as a whole.

[26] We have held on numerous occasions that when a claimant has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that her <underline>job</underline><underline>duties</underline> were the major cause of her disability or need for treatment, the claimant has failed to meet her burden of proof.<underline>Letha Lucas v. Maybelline</underline>, FC Opinion filed July 11, 1997 (<cross_reference>E402212</cross_reference>), <underline>Peggy Dunahoe v. American Pioneer</underline>, FC Opinion filed July 9, 1997 (<cross_reference>E603882</cross_reference>), <underline>Michael McDaniels v. Michael McDaniels,</underline><underline>D.D.S.</underline>, FC Opinion filed September 9, 1997 (<cross_reference>E600713</cross_reference>). Furthermore, we have stated "when analyzing major cause, one must look not only to claimant's physical activities, but also claimant's past medical history."  <underline>Wilma Roscoe v. Stone</underline><underline>Container</underline>, FC Opinion July 11, 1997 (<cross_reference>E510170</cross_reference>).  In <underline>Letha Lucas v.</underline><underline>Maybelline, supra</underline>, claimant presented an opinion from her family doctor stating that her job duties were the major cause of her disability; however, we placed no weight on that medical opinion.

[27] The Commission has the authority to accept or reject medical opinions, and its resolution of the medical evidence has the force and effect of a jury verdict. <underline>McClain v. Texaco, Inc.</underline>,<cross_reference>29 Ark. App. 218</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>780 S.W.2d 34</cross_reference> (1989).  The Commission need not base a decision on how the medical profession may characterize a given condition, but rather primarily on factors germane to the purposes of the Workers' Compensation Law.  <underline>Weldon v. Pierce</underline><underline>Brothers Construction Co.</underline>, <cross_reference>54 Ark. App. 344</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>925 S.W.2d 179</cross_reference>
(1996).

[28] In the case currently before the Commission, we are presented with a medical opinion regarding causation which is even less straightforward than that in <underline>Lucas</underline>.  In Dr. Raby's August 29, 1996, report he states:

<block_quote>     The patient says that she worked at the Cookie Company at Central Mall for seven months and she is asking if it could be the reason of her actual problem.  She states that she has been doing a lot of work with her hands like scooping and rolling cookie dough and she believes that it is the reason of her actual situation.  It is possible that it is related, but nobody can be very affirmative with that situation.</block_quote>

[29] Dr. Raby did not provide a medical opinion regarding causation.  Rather, he simply set forth in his medical report the fact that claimant believes her condition is related to her work. It is clear from reading Dr. Raby's August 29th report that he does not assert an opinion regarding causation.  Dr. Raby merely states that claimant's hypothesis is possible; he does not offer his own opinion.

[30] In addition, claimant confirmed that she was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 1993.  As a result of that accident, claimant injured her right shoulder. Claimant's supervisor testified that claimant advised her when she complained of her symptoms in January of 1996 that claimant had suffered from shoulder, arm, and hand problems as a result of the motor vehicle accident.

[31] Finally, I point out that the record reflects claimant did not work for respondent on a regular continuous employment basis until at least January of 1996.  Prior to that time, claimant only worked a sporadic schedule, at best, and at times none at all, due to her fiancee's medical problems.  If claimant's testimony is to be believed, she developed severe symptoms in January, and in fact reported these symptoms to her supervisor long before she ever terminated her employment.  It is difficult to conceive that within just the short time frame of January, 1996, that claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome, if caused by her employment with respondent, developed to the intense stage of numbness, pain, and tingling.  In <underline>April Lee v. The Mad Butcher</underline>, FC Opinion April 8, 1997 (<cross_reference>E507850</cross_reference>) we found that a claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome which reached the point of severe symptoms in less than four weeks is not compensable. In that opinion we stated "we find it hard to believe that the claimant's severe carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by her work at The Mad Butcher given the short duration of her employment."  The majority's attempt to distinguish the present claim from our decision in <underline>April Lee</underline>, supra on the grounds that the claimant's symptoms did not "totally manifest" themselves until several months later is misleading.  On one hand the majority implies that the symptoms were severe enough to warrant a wrist splint in early January, but on the other hand the majority suggests that the symptoms were not "manifested" until some later date.  In light of the finding in  <underline>April Lee</underline>, and the lack of persuasive medical evidence regarding causation, I cannot find that claimant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that her work was the major cause of her disability or need for treatment.  Therefore, I cannot find that claimant has met the major cause requirement.

[32] Since I find that claimant has failed to meet the major cause requirement, I find it unnecessary to address the remaining elements of a carpal tunnel claim.

[33] Therefore, for those reasons stated herein, I find that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge should be reversed, and I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.
