<opinion_text>[1]<center>                            <underline>OPINION AND ORDER</underline></center>
[2] Respondent No. 1 appeals a decision of the Administrative Law Judge filed on September 2, 1998, which held that claimant sustained a specific incident injury on July 9, 1997.  The Administrative Law Judge also determined that claimant is entitled medical benefits, including surgery, as well as an open-ended award of temporary total disability benefits commencing on May 15, 1998.  Further, the Administrative Law Judge determined that liability for benefits rested solely with Respondent No. 1. Based on our <underline>de</underline> <underline>novo</underline> review of the entire record, we find that claimant sustained a compensable aggravation of a pre-existing condition on July 9, 1997, and that he has proven entitlement to medical benefits, including surgical intervention, and an open-ended award of temporary total disability benefits commencing on May 15, 1998.  Therefore, we must affirm the Administrative Law Judge's decision.

[3] Claimant worked as a technician/mechanic for this employer. On July 9, 1997, he sustained an injury, which he described in the following manner:

<block_quote>     I was changing synchronizers in a transmission, gear box, auxiliary box. The box is on the table, the guy was helping me lift it on a jack, he was turning the yoke, which turns the gears. I had the gear in and I said don't turn the yoke, you turn the gears and I'm going to get my fingers in there and he went like this and I caught it before it hit the floor.</block_quote>

[4] Claimant stated that the transmission weighed about 250-300 lbs.  He testified that he experienced immediate pain in his lower back.  Claimant reported the incident to his supervisor, and was advised that he could seek medical treatment.  He testified that he declined the offer to obtain medical care. However, he stated that due to severe pain, he presented to the emergency room the following day.  Claimant has been examined by several physicians, and surgical intervention has been recommended.  He testified that he has back pain, which radiates into his left leg and buttocks.  He stated that he also experiences numbness in the great toe of his left foot.  Claimant testified that he is almost unable to stand erect.

[5] Claimant's medical history includes a motor vehicle accident that occurred in 1988.  Following this accident, claimant experienced back pain.  Additionally, knee surgery was performed. In 1992, while working for another employer, claimant stated that he injured his back. Dr. Claude Martinbeau treated claimant for his back complaints until 1994.  Claimant had diagnostic tests performed as early as 1988.  These studies included a 1988 CT scan, and a MRI in 1992.  Following the transmission incident, a second MRI was performed in 1997.  The findings of these tests were remarkably similar.

[6] The CT scan showed "[p]remature, osteophytic acquired spinal stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1, most marked at the upper level. There are findings at L4-5 suspect for right parimedian disc herniation. . . ."  The MRI conducted in 1992 revealed the following: "1. [l]eft lateral-far lateral herniated nucleus pulposus at L5-S1, which appears to encroach upon the exiting left L5 nerve root; 2. [b]ilateral spondylolysis with minimal spondylolisthesis at L5; and 3. [d]egenerative disc disease with mild diffuse disc bulging at multiple levels."  The last MRI demonstrated the presence of "L5 first degree spondylolisthesis with bilateral spondylolysis and acquired spinal stenosis; and L4-5 acquired spinal stenosis with right paracentral disc protrusion."

[7] Claimant contends that he sustained a compensable aggravation of a pre-existing condition on July 9, 1997.  An aggravation is a new injury; therefore, claimant must meet the definitional requirements of an accidental injury. <underline>Farmland</underline><underline>Ins. Company. V. DuBois</underline>, <cross_reference>54 Ark. App. 141</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>923 S.W.2d 883</cross_reference>
(1996).  On appeal Respondent No. 1 argues that since claimant's pre-injury and post-injury test results are virtually identical, he is unable to satisfy the objective findings requirement. However, at deposition the following exchange took place between claimant's counsel and Dr. Vincent Runnels:

<block_quote>     Q  Okay.  Let me ask you this: Is trauma that's sufficient to cause muscle spasms and pain like he has testified about sufficient, in your opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, to aggravate his preexisting spondylolisthesis?</block_quote>

A  Sure.  I would say it did aggravate it.

Q  And that's your opinion in this case?

A  Yeah.

[8] Dr. Runnels specifically testified that claimant's pre-existing spondylolisthesis was aggravated by the transmission incident.  His testimony establishes the requisite causal connection between the trauma claimant suffered on July 9, 1997, and the muscle spasms, which are objective findings.  Further, Dr. Runnels suggested comparing claimant's diagnostic studies for evidence of some slippage of the spondylolisthesis.  He opined that such a comparison would be useful in this case.  Dr. Runnels also testified that it would be important to consider both claimant's work record and medical history between back injuries. Between February 3, 1994, and July of 1997, claimant testified that he did not miss work due to back pain.  Moreover, he did not receive any medical treatment.

[9] Following Dr. Runnels' deposition, claimant's attorney asked Dr. Greg Jones to compare the results of claimant's diagnostic studies.  In a progress note dated May 27, 1998, Dr. Jones stated:

<block_quote>     I have reviewed the MRI studies from 1992 at Dr. Martinbeau's request with the plain radiographic films done in August of 1997 and it is my opinion that objectively there has been an increase in the spondylolisthesis.  There are clearly disc changes present at 4-5 and S-1, even at that juncture.  It remains my contention that this represents, and the basis of this more recent work related injury, exacerbation of a pre-existing condition.</block_quote>

[10] In a letter to claimant's counsel dated February 26, 1998, Dr. Jones reiterated his position, stating that: "After review of the medical records and based on the historical information provided to me by [claimant] and the multiple studies done to date, it is my opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical probability, that the recent injury of 9 July `97 represents an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition."  Since 1994, claimant had neither missed work nor obtained medical treatment for his back. Claimant testified that since the transmission incident on July 9, 1997, he has been unable to work. Although he suffered similar symptoms in the past, the severity has changed dramatically.  There are objective findings of an acute injury in the form of muscle spasms as well as the changes in the diagnostic studies, both of which were documented by Dr. Jones. With respect to the presence of muscle spasms, Dr. Jones stated in progress notes dated May 27, 1998, that "[claimant] continues to have marked paraspinous spasm that is palpable."   In our opinion, claimant suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing condition on July 9, 1997.  In reaching our decision, we specifically find that claimant has satisfied all of the requirements of a specific incident injury.

[11] Claimant contends that he is entitled to additional medical treatment, including surgery, for the treatment of his work-related injury.  The evidence shows that claimant's physicians have recommended surgical intervention.  In a letter to claimant's counsel dated February 26, 1998, Dr. Jones indicated that ". . . [i]t is further my opinion that within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the present proposed surgical stabilization and decompression has been necessitated by this recent exacerbation of the pre-existing spondylolisthesis/disc lesion."  We find that additional medical care, including surgical intervention, is reasonably necessary for the treatment of claimant's work-related injury.

[12] Claimant also contends that he is entitled to receive an open-ended award of temporary total disability benefits commencing on May 15, 1998, which is the date that Respondent No. 1 ceased benefit payments.  Entitlement to temporary total disability benefits requires claimant to satisfy a two-prong test: (1) claimant must be within her healing period; and (2) completely incapacitated from earning wages.  <underline>Arkansas</underline><underline>Highway  Transportation Department v. Breshears</underline>,<cross_reference>272 Ark. 244</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>613 S.W.2d 392</cross_reference> (1981).  The healing period is defined as that period for healing the injury, which continues until claimant is as far restored as the permanent nature of the injury will allow.  <underline>Nix v. Wilson World Hotel</underline>,<cross_reference>46 Ark. App. 303</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>879 S.W.2d 457</cross_reference> (1994). In the event that the underlying condition has stabilized and there is no additional treatment that will improve claimant's condition, the healing period has ended.  <underline>Id</underline>. This question is one of fact for the Commission to resolve.

[13] Temporary total disability is awarded when claimant is incapacitated because of injury to earn the wages she was receiving at the time of the injury.  <underline>Johnson v. Rapid Die  </underline><underline>Molding</underline>, <cross_reference>46 Ark. App. 244</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>878 S.W.2d 790</cross_reference> (1994).

[14] Claimant testified that he has been unable to work since the occurrence of the transmission incident.  In a chart note dated May 27, 1998, Dr. Jones documented "marked paraspinous spasm" and a "markedly antalgic gait."  He stated that claimant reported back and left leg pain.  Dr. Jones indicated that claimant was experiencing a great deal of pain, and he referred claimant to Dr. Robert Fisher for pain management.  In his referral letter to Dr. Fisher, Dr. Jones stated that claimant has "a history of chronic back pain, an acute injury in a work setting in the summer of 1997, and since that time, severe and disabling left leg radicular pain.  He has spondylolisthesis and a disc lesion at L4-5 on the left."  In our opinion, claimant has satisified the two-prong test set forth in <underline>Breshears</underline>. Therefore, we find that claimant is entitled to receive an open-ended award of temporary total disability benefits commencing on May 15, 1998.

[15] Accordingly, based on our <underline>de</underline> <underline>novo</underline> review of the entire record, and for the reasons stated herein, we find that claimant has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a compensable aggravation of a pre-existing condition on July 9, 1997, and is entitled to medical benefits, including surgical intervention. Moreover, we find that claimant has demonstrated entitlement to an open-ended award of temporary total disability benefits commencing on May 15, 1998.

[16] All accrued benefits shall be paid in a lump sum without discount and with interest thereon at the lawful rate from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision in accordance with Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-809</cross_reference> (Repl. 1996).  For prevailing on this appeal before the Full Commission, claimant's attorney is hereby awarded an additional attorney's fee totaling $250.00 pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-715</cross_reference> (Repl. 1996).

[20] I concur in the principal findings and award of benefits.  I write separately only to clarify that, although the Second Injury Fund has been named a party-respondent in this case (i.e. as Respondent No. 2), there is no dispute between the parties that Respondent No. 2 has no liability for the benefits presently at issue in this case.  The Second Injury Fund has been named a party only with regard to its potential liability for future benefits not at issue in the present claim.  Consequently, Respondent No. 1 is solely liable for the benefits awarded in the present claim.

</concurrence_text><dissent_byline>[22] Commissioner Wilson dissents.

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>[23]<center>                           <underline>DISSENTING OPINION</underline></center>
[24] I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion finding that claimant sustained a compensable aggravation of a pre-existing condition for which respondent No. 1 is solely liable.  In order to prove the compensability of an aggravation claimant bears the burden of satisfying all the elements of a compensable injury. <underline>Ford v. Chempulp Process Inc.</underline>,<cross_reference>63 Ark. App. 260</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>977 S.W.2d 5</cross_reference> (1998).  Accordingly, claimant must establish his compensable injury by medical evidence supported by "objective findings."  Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(D).

[25] The only potential objective medical finding which existed after the July 9, 1997 work-related incident which was not present before the incident was Dr. Jones' finding of muscle spasms first detected on September 18, 1997.  The overwhelming medical evidence of record conclusively shows that all objective diagnostic studies were the same both prior to and subsequent to the July 9, 1997 incident.  In fact, after going over all of claimant's diagnostic findings in great depth in his deposition, Dr. Runnels was asked:

<block_quote>     Q.  And you don't have any objective findings, micro-worsening, or whatever, to indicate that anything has increased or worsened — since July 9, 1997?</block_quote>

[26] To which he responded:

<block_quote>     A.  You're right.  After we've looked at this in great detail, I'd have to agree with you.</block_quote>

[27] Claimant argues that Dr. Jones' conclusions set forth in a Progress Note dated May 27, 1998, that claimant's spondylolesthesis of a greater magnitude as evidenced by the 1997 diagnostic studies when compared to the 1992 studies is an objective medical finding supporting a compensable injury.  In his Progress Report, Dr. Jones stated:

<block_quote>     There are clearly disc changes present at 4-5 and 5-1, even at that juncture. It remains my contention that this represents, and the basis of this more recent work-related injury, exacerbation of a pre-existing condition.</block_quote>

[28] However, when Dr. Jones' May 27, 1998 correspondence to claimant's attorney is reviewed, it becomes apparent that Dr. Jones' opinion regarding a greater magnitude of forward slippage is greatly impaired since he was comparing plain radiographs from 1997 to MRI images from 1992.  In essence, he was comparing apples to oranges which undermines the validity of his opinion set forth in the Progress Note that there was, in fact, an increase in slippage which is due to the work-related incident. Consequently, I cannot find that Dr. Jones' conclusion that there has been an increase in the degree of spondylolesthesis is, in fact, an objective finding supporting the existence of a compensable injury.

[29] Furthermore, I am not convinced that the muscle spasms detected by Dr. Jones two and a half months after claimant's work-related incident represent objective medical findings of a work-related injury.  Claimant was seen in the emergency room by his family physician, by Dr. Cheyne, and by Dr. Landherr without the presence of muscle spasms ever being detected.  In my opinion, if the work-related incident were to cause muscle spasms, the muscle spasms should have been detected by one of these physicians since they saw the claimant closer in time to the incident itself. Since the spasms were not detected by Dr. Jones until more than two and a half months after the incident occurred, and since they were not detected by any treating physician prior to that date, it is my opinion that to conclude that the muscle spasms are related to the work-related incident, and not the underlying pre-existing condition, would require speculation and conjecture.  Conjecture and speculation, even if plausible, cannot take the place of proof.  <underline>Ark. Dept. of</underline><underline>Correction v. Glover</underline>, <cross_reference>35 Ark. App. 32</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>812 S.W.2d 692</cross_reference>
(1991).  <underline>Dena Construction Co. v. Herndon</underline>,<cross_reference>264 Ark. 791</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>575 S.W.2d 155</cross_reference> (1970).  <underline>Arkansas Methodist Hospital v.</underline><underline>Adams</underline>, <cross_reference>43 Ark. App. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>858 S.W.2d 125</cross_reference> (1993).

[30] Claimant clearly had the condition of spondylolesthesis before the July 9, 1997 incident.  It is this condition which claimant's treating physicians now wish to surgically address.  I cannot find, based upon the evidence of record, that claimant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that respondent is in any way responsible for claimant's pre-existing condition of spondylolesthesis.  Therefore, I find that claimant has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a compensable injury in the form of a new injury or aggravation on July 9, 1997, supported by the existence of objective medical findings.  Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.
