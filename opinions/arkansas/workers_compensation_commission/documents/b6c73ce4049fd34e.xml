Presently before the Commission is respondent's Motion to Dismiss Appeal to the Arkansas Court of Appeals. After consideration of respondent's motion, claimant's response thereto, and all other matters properly before the Commission, we find that respondent's motion should be granted.

On December 18, 2006, the respondent filed a Notice of Appeal from the Full Commission opinion filed May November 17, 2006. The respondent now seeks to withdraw his appeal to the Court of Appeals. The claimant has agreed to this dismissal.

After duly considering the respondent's motion and all other matters properly before the Commission, we find that respondent's Motion to Dismiss his Appeal to the Court of Appeals should be granted.

Pursuant to Ark. R. App. P. Rule 3 (b), this Commission can dismiss an appeal to the Court of Appeals only if the Motion to Dismiss is filed with the Commission before the record is docketed with the Court, and if all parties to the appeal petition for dismissal and jointly stipulate that the case is to be dismissed. See also, In Re Arkansas Rules of Appellate Procedure 3(b), <cross_reference>296 Ark. 580</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>756</cross_reference> S.W.2d LXXV (1988).

In the present case, the respondent filed a timely appeal, both parties have stipulated to dismiss the appeal, and the record has not yet been lodged with the Court of Appeals. Therefore, we find that the respondent's motion to withdraw the appeal must be and hereby is granted.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
