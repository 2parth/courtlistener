[2] Respondent appeals from a decision of the Administrative Law Judge filed April 10, 1997 awarding claimant temporary total disability benefits. Based upon our <underline>de novo</underline> review of the entire record, we find that claimant sustained a compensable injury on June 16, 1996 but she has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence entitlement to any temporary total disability benefits.

[3] Claimant contends that she sustained a specific incident injury on June 16, 1996 when she and a co-worker were lifting and moving a patient. The claimant in the present claim alleges that she sustained an injury as a result of a specific incident which is identifiable by time and place of occurrence. Therefore, the claimant must satisfy the following requirements contained within Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference> (Repl. 1996):

<block_quote>     (1) "Compensable injury" means: An accidental injury causing internal or external physical harm to the body . . . arising out of and in the course of employment and which requires medical services or results in disability or death. An injury is "accidental" only if it is caused by a specific incident and is identifiable by time and place of occurrence. Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(A)(i) (Repl. 1996).</block_quote>

<block_quote>     (2) A compensable injury must be established by medical evidence, supported by "objective findings" as defined in § <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(16). Ark. Code Ann. §  <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(D) (Repl. 1996). "Objective findings" are those findings which cannot come under the voluntary control of the patient. Ark. Code Ann. §  <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(16)(A)(i) (Repl. 1996).</block_quote>

<block_quote>     (3) For injuries falling within the definition of compensable injury under subdivision (5)(A)(i) of this section, the burden of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence. Ark. Code Ann. §  <cross_reference>11-9-102</cross_reference>(5)(E)(i) (Repl. 1996).</block_quote>

[4] If the claimant fails to establish by a preponderance of the credible evidence any of the requirements for establishing the compensability of the injury she fails to establish the compensability of the claim, and compensation must be denied. Claimant presented credible corroborated evidence that she sustained an injury on June 16, 1996. Claimant immediately reported the incident to her co-worker and eventually to her supervisor. Claimant obtained emergency medical care and was diagnosed with lumbar strain and spasms. Accordingly, we find that claimant has satisfied the necessary elements proving the compensability of her claim. Therefore, we affirm this finding of the Administrative Law Judge.

[5] However, we further find that claimant has failed to prove entitlement to temporary total disability benefits. Temporary total disability period is the period within the healing period in which an employee suffers a total incapacity to earn wages. <underline>Ark.</underline><underline>State Highway  Trans. Dept. v. Breshears</underline>, <cross_reference>272 Ark. 244</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>613 S.W.2d 392</cross_reference> (1981). The healing period continues until the employee is a far restored as the permanent character of his injury will permit. <underline>Mad Butcher, Inc. v. Parker</underline>, <cross_reference>4 Ark. App. 124</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>628 S.W.2d 582</cross_reference> (1982). If the underlying condition causing the disability has become stable and if nothing further in the way of treatment will improve that condition, the healing period has ended. <underline>Id.</underline> The persistence of pain may not of itself prevent a finding that the healing period is over, provided that the underlying condition has stabilized.

[6] Claimant was first treated for her injury on June 16, 1996, at St. Joseph's Emergency Medical Center. The emergency room physician removed claimant from work for <underline>two</underline> days and released her to return to light duty on June 19, 1996. On that date, claimant was again seen in the emergency room and was taken off work for<underline>four</underline> more days. At the end of the four days, claimant was seen by a physician at Mediquick on 6/24/96 and was released to return to light-duty work on the following day, and according to claimant's testimony, she did return to her employer after her injury and worked light-duty. Subsequent to June 25, 1996, each release claimant received from her medical care providers released claimant to return to light-duty work. According to the record, respondent had light-duty work available which claimant did perform. However, despite being released to return to light-duty and having light-duty work within her restrictions made available, claimant would call in to her employer and advise that she was unable to work due to pain in her back. These absences from work were unexcused since all of claimant's physicians had released her to return to light-duty. Pursuant to company policy, after accumulating three successive unexcused absences without a physician's release from work, claimant was terminated from her job.

[7] The record reflects that claimant was held off work by her physicians for a total of only <underline>six</underline> days. Accordingly, claimant has not met the requirement for entitlement to temporary total disability benefits. Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-501</cross_reference>(a). After the six days off from work, claimant was released to return to work in a light-duty capacity. All evidence in the record indicates that light-duty was made available to the claimant and claimant in fact returned to work and worked pursuant to these releases. Even after claimant began to call in to her employer stating that she was unable to return to work, claimant was seen by authorized medical care providers and advised to return to work and to continue current light-duties. See respondent's exhibit number B-6, 9, 10, and 11. Between July 15, 1996 and August 15, 1996, the record reflects that claimant called in to work on at least four occasions, if not more, stating that she would be unable to work due to the pain in her back. However, claimant did not see a physician during this time frame to alter or modify her work restrictions. On August 15, 1996, when claimant was seen by her physician, claimant was released to return to full duty.

[8] Based upon this evidence, we cannot find that claimant has proven by preponderance of the evidence that she was totally incapacitated from earning wages after being released to return to light-duty on June 24, 1996. Therefore, we find that claimant has failed to meet her burden of proof. Accordingly, we revere the finding of the Administrative Law Judge.

[9] IT IS SO ORDERED.
