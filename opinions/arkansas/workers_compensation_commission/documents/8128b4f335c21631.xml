[2] This claim comes on for review before the Full Commission on motion by the claimant's attorney to withdraw as counsel. Pursuant to a letter dated June 12, 1996, all parties, including the claimant, were advised of attorney McKinnon's motion to withdraw as counsel. However, no objections to the motion have been filed. Therefore, after our review of attorney McKinnon's motion, and all other matters properly before the Commission, we find the motion should be granted.

[3] Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we hereby grant attorney McKinnon's motion to withdraw as counsel.

[4] IT IS SO ORDERED.
