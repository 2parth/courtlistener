Comes now for consideration the respondents no. 1 motion to dismiss appeal filed July 1, 2011 and the claimant's motion to dismiss cross-appeal filed July 5, 2011. From the motions, the failure of either adverse party to object to the motions, and other matters known or made known to the Full Commission, the Full Commission finds that respondents no. 1's motion to dismiss appeal<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
should be and hereby is granted and that the claimant's motion to dismiss cross-appeal should be and is hereby granted.

The Full Commission therefore dismisses respondents no. 1's appeal and claimant's cross-appeal.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
