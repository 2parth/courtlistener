<opinion_text><center>                            <underline>OPINION AND ORDER</underline></center>
Respondent appealed a decision of the Administrative Law Judge filed on December 30, 1999, awarding an arthrogram of claimant's left shoulder at respondent's expense, prior to a finding of compensability. Respondent asserted that the Workers' Compensation Act does not allow an award of medical benefits prior to a finding of compensability, that the United Stated Constitution prevents such an award as an unlawful taking without due process of law, and that even if the arthrogram is performed, claimant cannot satisfy the requirements of compensability because such a finding would require speculation. Claimant argued that the case law supports the award, that because the right (compensable) shoulder injury and left (controverted) shoulder injury occurred (allegedly) in the same incident, the objective findings for the right shoulder are applicable to the left and claimant's left shoulder injury should be considered compensable.  Claimant further argued that if the claims are treated separately, then he is entitled to a remand in order to seek additional benefits.  Claimant also asserts that the award is not an unconstitutional taking because the statute is constitutional.

In claimant's pre-hearing questionnaire response, he stated that the issues to be litigated at the hearing were that the left shoulder injury is compensable and that the medical treatment of that injury is the responsibility of respondent.  The extent and permanency of the injury was reserved.  At the hearing, claimant's attorney explained that he was seeking an order awarding an arthrogram pursuant to <underline>Colvert</underline>, <italic>infra</italic>, in order to determine if claimant has a rotator cuff injury to his left shoulder, and that he did not want to litigate compensability at the hearing. Respondent's attorney stated that even if the arthrogram was performed, the requirements of compensability cannot be proved.

After our <italic>de novo</italic> review of the entire record, we find that the Administrative Law Judge's opinion should be reversed.  We base our finding on the fact that Ark. Code Ann. Section <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference>
precludes respondent from liability for non-compensable injuries and that there appears to be no authority in the Commission to require respondent to pay for that which has not been proven to be its liability.

The parties stipulated that claimant sustained a compensable injury on March 17, 1997 to his right shoulder.  On March 17, 1997, claimant was loading freight on a trailer.  As he stacked merchandise higher and higher, he had more pain in his shoulders. He reported this to his supervisor and the "Loss Prevention" department, and then decided to see the company doctor, with approval, and later he saw an orthopaedist who performed a surgical procedure on his right shoulder.  Since March 17, 1997, claimant experienced pain in his left shoulder which was the same as the right shoulder pain but not as severe.  Claimant testified that he told the doctor about the left shoulder pain.  Claimant continued to have left shoulder discomfort and pain.  Claimant explained that his pain is "just on the top of my shoulder, the rotator cuff area, and I experience pain at night laying in the bed, and, you know, any type of physical activity, restricted, you know, in some of my movements."  He stated that he began having trouble doing activities like reaching up to the center of his back or to his upper back and trying to thread a belt through his belt loops after his March injury, which he had not experienced before.  The pain in his left shoulder is similar to the pain he felt in his right shoulder before his operation. Claimant testified that in 1992, he was playing softball when he ran into a fence in the outfield, and has had ongoing pain and discomfort in both shoulders since then, which became worse after the 1997 incidents.  Claimant saw a company doctor after the 1992 injury, and he took a two week leave without pay and oral medication.

The Administrative Law Judge and claimant rely upon our holding in <underline>Colvert v. Henkels  McCoy</underline>, Full Commission Opinion filed August 25, 1998 (WCC No. <cross_reference>E615702</cross_reference>) in support of the award. Also of relevance to this issue are <underline>Fairchild v. Kentucky Fried</underline><underline>Chicken</underline>, Full Commission Opinion filed March 24, 1997 (<cross_reference>E511344</cross_reference>),<underline>Southern Hospitalities v. Britain</underline>, <cross_reference>54 Ark. App. 318</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>925 S.W.2d 81</cross_reference> (1996), and Ark. Code Ann. Sections <cross_reference>11-9-508</cross_reference>, 510, and 511.

In <underline>Fairchild</underline>, <italic>supra</italic>, the Commission reversed an award of compensability and of an independent medical examination at the respondent's expense.  The judge had first intended to order the respondent to provide the examination prior to finding compensability because objective findings were needed, but when the respondent balked, he found compensability and then ordered the examination.  First, the Commission held that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant suffered a specific incident identifiable by time and place.  Then we held that the award of an independent medical evaluation to identify objective findings was also inappropriate in this case.  The respondent had argued that the administrative law judge lacked the authority to require it to pay for an independent medical evaluation because the result was to force the respondent to "subsidize" the claimant's case and that the judge exceeded his authority in ordering an independent medical evaluation.  The Commission agreed that the order of an IME was inappropriate.  However, the Commission disagreed as to the judge's authority, citing the explicit authority to order independent medical examinations in Ark. Code Ann Section<cross_reference>11-9-511</cross_reference>(a), but went on to state that "the proper procedure would have been for the Administrative Law Judge to hold in abeyance a finding of compensability until such time as an independent medical evaluation could be done on the claimant."  The <underline>Fairchild</underline>
claim was dismissed by the Commission.

In <underline>Colvert</underline>, <italic>supra</italic>, a diagnostic arthrogram was deemed reasonable and necessary, and the respondent was ordered to provide it.  The respondents stipulated that the claimant was involved in an accident which arose in the course and scope of his employment.  The respondent however refused to pay for the arthrogram because there were no objective findings to support a compensable injury.  The respondents first controverted the claim at the point when they denied the arthrogram.  The Commission stated that we have "the authority to order a physical examination of, and treatment for, an injured employee claiming entitlement to workers' compensation benefits.  Ark. Code Ann. Section<cross_reference>11-9-511</cross_reference>(a)," and went on to say:

<block_quote>  we note that neither the Administrative Law Judge nor the Commission has found that claimant sustained a compensable injury and then ordered respondent to pay for an arthrogram. We have simply found that claimant is entitled to have the recommended diagnostic procedure performed, at respondent's expense, to determined the nature and extent of any shoulder problem claimant may have. Following the arthrogram, respondent can certainly request a ruling on whether claimant sustained a compensable injury within the meaning of  <cross_reference>Act 796 of 1993</cross_reference>. <italic>See</italic> <underline>Fairchild</underline>, [<italic>supra</italic>].</block_quote>

The Commission relied upon Ark. Code Ann. Section <cross_reference>11-9-511</cross_reference>(a) for its authority to order an independent medical examination in<underline>Fairchild</underline> and to order the arthrogram in <underline>Colvert</underline>.  This section states:

<block_quote>  An injured employee claiming to be entitled to compensation shall submit to such physical examination and treatment by another qualified physician, designated or approved by the Workers' Compensation Commission, as the commission may require from time to time if reasonable and necessary.</block_quote>

However, the Commission's reliance on this statute in <underline>Colvert</underline>
to require the respondent to pay for the procedure in the absence of proof of compensability is misplaced because such a requirement directly violates Ark. Code Ann. Section <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference> which explicitly states that the:

<block_quote>  employer shall not be liable for any of the payments provided for in §§ <cross_reference>11-9-508</cross_reference> — <cross_reference>11-9-516</cross_reference> in the case of a contest of liability where the Workers' Compensation Commission shall decide that the injury does not come within the provisions of this chapter.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

This statute is brought up in only one case to our knowledge:<underline>Southern Hospitalities v. Britain</underline>, <cross_reference>54 Ark. App. 318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>925 S.W.2d 81</cross_reference>
(1996), in which the Court of Appeals held that the claimant failed to prove a compensable injury but that the respondent was liable for the medical treatment received from the company doctor under the equitable doctrine of estoppel.  The respondent in that case had initially accepted the injury as compensable and directed claimant to a doctor of its own choosing.  It was only after the treatment failed to result in any objective findings of injury that the respondent controverted the claim.  Because the claimant was led to believe that her treatment would be covered, the court held the respondent liable, despite the fact that the claim was not compensable.  Judge Jennings, while concurring on the finding that the claim was not compensable, dissented from the award of medical expenses, because the Commission had made no finding of fact regarding estoppel, which is ordinarily a question of fact, and because of the explicit language of <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference>.  Unfortunately for our analysis, the Court of Appeals did not address the statutory section pointed out by Judge Jennings.

The Court of Appeals has required that a respondent provide a claimant a psychological evaluation in order to determine whether the claimant sustained a mental injury as a result of the physical injuries sustained in his admittedly compensable car accident, in<underline>Terrell v. Arkansas Trucking Serv., Inc.</underline>, <cross_reference>60 Ark. App. 93</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>959 S.W.2d 70</cross_reference> (1998) a case which did not involve the estoppel theory. The claimant could not prevail on a mental injury claim without demonstrating that his mental injury was causally connected to his admittedly compensable physical injury, and the claimant, while obviously suffering mental difficulties, had not been thoroughly psychologically evaluated.  The Court did not discuss Ark. Code Ann. Section <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference>.

As is oft repeated, the Legislature has explicitly charged the Commission with strict construction of the Act, and has specifically stated that the Act shall not be broadened in any manner by the Commission or the Courts, but only be legislative amendment.  Ark. Code Ann. Section <cross_reference>11-9-1001</cross_reference>.  It is our opinion that we are barred by Section <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference> from requiring respondent to pay for an arthrogram prior to a finding of compensability. Our opinion is bolstered by the Legislature's clear direction to follow the specific limits of the Act without expansion or deviation therefrom.

There are two other flaws in the decision of the Administrative Law Judge pursuant to <underline>Colvert</underline>.  First, <underline>Colvert</underline> and<underline>Fairchild</underline> are cases involving independent medical examinations, which are specifically regulated by Ark. Code Ann. Section 511. This is not the appropriate statutory section in the present claim.  That section applies to "physical examination and treatment by <underline>another</underline> qualified physician" as ordered by the Commission. (Emphasis added.)  The current claim concerns an arthrogram performed by <underline>claimant's treating physicians</underline>.   We hope this does not appear to be splitting hairs, but the statute would not include "another" if it was not intended to mean "another" physician.  A claim for an additional examination by claimant's already treating physicians more appropriately falls within Section <cross_reference>11-9-508</cross_reference> which states:

<block_quote>  (a) The employer shall promptly provide for an injured employee such medical, surgical, hospital, . . . services . . . as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the injury received by the employee.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (b) If the employer fails to provide the medical services set out in subsection (a) of this section within a reasonable time after knowledge of the injury, the Workers' Compensation Commission may direct that the injured employee obtain the medical service at the expense of the employer, and any emergency treatment afforded the injured employee shall be at the expense of the employer. In no circumstance may an employee, his family, or dependents, be billed or charged for any portion of the cost of providing the benefits to which he is entitled under this chapter.</block_quote>

Thus, the Commission is authorized to require a respondent to provide medical treatment at its own expense. However, in regard to this statute, the Supreme Court has stated that the employer is required to provide reasonable and necessary treatment of compensable injuries, <underline>Northwest Tire Serv. v. Evans</underline>, <cross_reference>295 Ark. 246</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>748 S.W.2d 134</cross_reference> (1988), and the statute itself states that the services must be "reasonably necessary in connection with the injury."  In fact, Section <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference> again applies to this requirement, and prevents employer liability for injuries that do "not come within the provisions of this chapter."  The conclusion that respondents cannot be required to pay medical benefits without a finding of compensability is again bolstered by Ark. Code Ann. Section <cross_reference>11-9-1001</cross_reference>, in which the Legislature, in admonishing the judicial branch of state government in its interpretation of Chapter 9, stated that the "major and controlling purpose of workers' compensation is to pay timely temporary and permanent disability benefits to all legitimately injured workers that suffer an injury or disease arising out of and in the course of their employment, [and] to pay reasonable and necessary medical expenses resulting therefrom. . . ."   The Commission is not in the business of requiring general health insurance to the workers of Arkansas, but is charged with upholding the requirements of Chapter 9, that is to award benefits to workers with compensable injuries and to deny them to workers with non-compensable injuries.

The second flaw is that the facts do not warrant the application of the doctrine of estoppel here.  First, the treatment has not yet been provided, there is no question that respondent controverts claimant's entitlement to the treatment, and there is no question that absent an order by the commission, the treatment will not be authorized by respondent.  Claimant has in no way been misled about the situation.  Also, claimant has not asserted the estoppel theory or alleged any facts to support a finding that respondent is estopped from denying payment. The facts do not justify an award of the arthrogram based upon an extension (which we find is inappropriate anyways) of  <underline>Southern</underline><underline>Hospitalities</underline> estoppel theory.

When read together, the statutes and cases above, give the Commission the authority to require that a respondent should pay for all reasonable and necessary medical treatment of compensable injuries.  It further appears that the Court of Appeals will enforce an order requiring a respondent to pay for medical expenses, in the absence of a finding of compensability, where a claimant has been led to believe that his treatment would be paid through the workers' compensation system by the respondent.  We repeat that the <underline>Colvert</underline> decision cannot be applied to force respondent to pay for the arthrogram in the current claim because the facts and statutes are different.

Claimant's attorney makes the suggestion that the left shoulder claim and right shoulder claim should be considered one and the same, in an apparent attempt to bar respondent from denying treatment for the left shoulder. However, respondent has only stipulated to a compensable right shoulder injury, and in fact, claimant filed two claims, one for the right shoulder and one for the left. Claimant's request that the claims, if considered separate, be remanded to allow him to seek additional benefits, should be denied, first because claimant filed two separate claims, second, because there are two separate injuries, one which is stipulated to have occurred on March 17, 1997, and an alleged injury alleged to have occurred at the same time, and third, because there would be no purpose in remanding to seek additional benefits where that right seems to still exist. Lastly, claimant failed to file a cross appeal.

After our de novo review of the entire record, we reverse the decision of the Administrative Law Judge and hold that respondent cannot be made liable for any of claimant's expenses until after a finding of compensability.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> It has been suggested that this phrase "within the provisions of this chapter" could be construed in a manner to avoid this conclusion.   In keeping with our understanding of statutory construction, where the plain meaning of a statute is preferred over tortuous interpretation, this phrase means that an injury must be compensable to be compensable.  "This chapter" would reasonably be construed to mean the chapter in which the phrase appears, Chapter 9, Workers' Compensation of the Arkansas Code Annotated, Section <cross_reference>11-9-101</cross_reference> <italic>et seq.</italic>  The "provisions" of this chapter require that specific standards must be met to allow a claimant to be eligible for benefits for an injury and enunciate specific definitions.

</dissent_byline><dissent_text><center>                           <underline>DISSENTING OPINION</underline></center>
I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this case.  In my opinion, respondents are liable for the performance of an arthrogram.

Claimant worked as a laborer on the receiving dock for respondents.  His job entailed unloading tractor trailers.  On February 19, 1997, he was sorting five-gallon buckets of paint. This process entailed moving the buckets from one pallet to another.  During the performance of this task, claimant began experiencing sharp shoulder pain bilaterally.  After reporting this, forms were completed documenting the occurrence.

Claimant did not seek medical treatment following the February incident.  He continued to work, and on March 17, 1997, he again experienced bilateral shoulder pain as he stacked merchandise in a truck on the shipping dock. After reporting this, claimant was taken to the company physician for treatment.  Dr. Justus placed him on light duty. Claimant stated that he was assigned to operate a scan gun.

Claimant indicated that although he had pain in both shoulders, the right shoulder pain was more intense, and it became the focal point for treatment.  The medical records substantiate claimant's testimony.

In a chart note dated March 17, 1997, Dr. Michael G. Justus documented claimant's history of a work-related accident. Dr. Justus' note also showed that claimant complained of bilateral shoulder pain.  However, he further indicated that the right shoulder was more symptomatic. Based on claimant's history of bilateral rotator cuff injuries in 1992, and his clinical examination, Dr. Justus referred claimant to Dr. Kyle R. Blickenstaff, an orthopedist.  This evaluation occurred on March 19, 1997. In a letter to the administrative law judge dated July 15, 1999, Dr. Blickenstaff summarized his treatment of claimant as follows:

<block_quote>  [Claimant] was treated for a right rotator cuff tendon tear beginning 3/19/97 and his treatment was completed 2/10/98.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  During that period of time he also complained of some left shoulder pain that he related to a episode at work in February of 1997.  His physical exam was consistent with some left shoulder tendinitis vs. possible rotator cuff tear which has not been substantiated or ruled out by arthrogram.  I have recommended an arthrogram on the left shoulder.</block_quote>

In my opinion, respondents are liable for the cost of an arthrogram.  Respondents concede that claimant sustained a compensable injury on March 17, 1997, but it is their contention that claimants sustained only a right shoulder injury on that date.  The medical records fail to support the theory advanced by respondents.  For instance, the earliest medical records document bilateral shoulder complaints.  Although a right shoulder x-ray, which was done in March of 1997, was "essentially unremarkable," claimant has never had any sophisticated diagnostic testing. However, as early as May 7, 1997, Dr. Blickenstaff recommended an arthrogram of claimant's left shoulder.  This recommendation is reiterated in a chart note dated May 28, 1997.  A chart note dated November 13, 1997, showed that claimant complained of left shoulder pain during physical therapy.  Also, in a note dated February 10, 1998, Dr. Blickenstaff indicated that claimant continued to experience left shoulder symptoms.

The majority cites Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference> to support their position.  This section states:

<block_quote>  The employer shall not be liable for any of the payments provided for in §§ <cross_reference>11-9-508</cross_reference> — <cross_reference>11-9-516</cross_reference> in the case of a contest of liability where the Workers' Compensation Commission shall decide that the injury does not come within the provisions of this chapter.</block_quote>

In my opinion, § <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference> is a bar to imposing medical expenses upon respondents where the Commission has determined that claimant failed to prove the occurrence of a compensable injury. Although the majority has chosen to comment on the compensability of claimant's left shoulder injury, the fact remains that the issue of compensability was specifically reserved.

The interpretation of § <cross_reference>11-9-510</cross_reference> that I have suggested is consistent with the majority's holding in <underline>Laura Fairchild v.</underline><underline>Kentucky Fried Chicken</underline>, Full Commission Opinion filed March 24, 1997 (<cross_reference>E511344</cross_reference>).  In <underline>Fairchild</underline>, the majority stated that it was error for the administrative law judge to find claimant's injury compensable, and order an IME to determine the existence of objective findings.  We indicated that the better procedure is to hold the issue of compensability in abeyance until after the performance of diagnostic testing.  This is precisely the situation with which we are faced.  In my view, claimant is entitled to an arthrogram at the expense of respondents.

I would also note that ordering respondents to pay for an arthrogram is consistent with the holding of the Court of Appeals in <underline>Terrell v. Arkansas Trucking Serv., Inc.</underline>,<cross_reference>60 Ark. App. 93</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>959 S.W.2d 70</cross_reference> (1998).

Based on the foregoing, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this case.
