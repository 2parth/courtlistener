This matter is currently before the Commission on the respondents' motion to file Briefs on remand.

After our consideration of the motion, the response by the claimant, and all other matters properly before the Commission, we find that the motion should be denied.

The respondents' argument in the attached proposed brief is very similar to the brief filed with the Commission in July 2009, while the case was on appeal to the Commission. The Commission is well aware of those arguments.<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
With these arguments, and the proof already in the record, the Commission can make a decision based on the record and argument already before us. The respondents' motion is hereby denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
