[2] This case comes to us as a remand from the Court of Appeals. The Court found that the Commission did not make clear the findings on which it based its denial of permanent partial impairment and wage loss benefits. The claimant contends that he has a permanent partial impairment rating of 10% and that he is entitled to wage loss. We find that the evidence does not support a finding of permanent impairment.

[3] The claimant sustained an injury to that portion of his body which is not scheduled under the Act. Therefore, the claimant's entitlement to permanent disability benefits is controlled by Ark. Code Ann. §<cross_reference>11-9-522</cross_reference>. Permanent disability compensation is paid where the permanent effects of a work-related injury incapacitates the worker from earning the wages in which he was receiving at the time of the injury. When making a determination of the degree of permanent disability sustained by an injured worker with an unscheduled injury, the Commission must consider medical evidence demonstrating the degree to which the worker's anatomical disabilities impair his earning capacity, as well as other factors such as the worker's age, education, work experience, and other matters which may reasonably be expected to affect the workers' future earning capacity. Such other matters are motivation, post-injury income, credibility, and demeanor. <underline>Glass v. Edens,</underline><cross_reference>233 Ark. 786</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>346 S.W.2d 685</cross_reference> (1961); <underline>City of Fayetteville v.</underline><underline>Guess,</underline> <cross_reference>10 Ark. App. 313</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>663 S.W.2d 946</cross_reference> (1984). <underline>Curry v.</underline><underline>Franklin Electric,</underline> <cross_reference>32 Ark. App. 168</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798 S.W.2d 130</cross_reference> (1990). When it becomes evident that the worker's underlying condition has become stable and that no further treatment will improve the condition, the disability is deemed to be permanent. If the employee is totally incapacitated from earning a livelihood at that time, he is entitled to compensation for permanent and total disability. <underline>Minor v.</underline><underline>Poinsett Lumber  Manufacturing Co.,</underline> <cross_reference>235 Ark. 195</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>357 S.W.2d 504</cross_reference> (1962).

[4] The claimant contends that he has a permanent impairment of 5% to 10% based upon the opinions of Dr. Cutler who assigned the claimant a 5% rating on September 7, 1993, and by Dr. Harris who assigned the claimant a 10% impairment rating on November 5, 1993. In the opinion of the Administrative Law Judge, which was affirmed and adopted by the Commission, these ratings were found not to be based upon objective and measurable findings.

[5] Dr. Cutler states in a letter dated September 7, 1993, that if he "must give a percentage of rating", he would assign the claimant a 5% impairment rating "in view of the paucity of objective findings." It appears that Dr. Cutler found very few objective findings in which to base his decision. He stated in his letter that if the nerve conduction studies reflected true abnormalities, <underline>"at least</underline><underline>that is an objective finding and can strengthen my feelings</underline><underline>that he is telling the truth about his discomfort."</underline>
(Emphasis added.) From this statement, it is evident that Dr. Cutler is not sure if the claimant was being truthful about the amount of pain he was experiencing. Dr. Cutler thought further testing was necessary.

[6] Dr. Harris' rating is set forth in a letter of November 5, 1993, which states:

<block_quote>     Mr. Harper's disability has lasted for almost two years and he has shown only modest improvement with the medical modalities (heat, massage, trigger point injections [sic], analgesics and muscle relaxants) we've used. I don't expect much more improvement even with a full back rehabilitation program, beginning this far from the onset of his injury.</block_quote>

<block_quote>     Mr. Harper remains totally disabled for his previous occupation (sic) as a truck driver as well as any nonsedentary work that required no bending, lifting, pulling or pushing (sic). He has approximately 10% disability of his body as a whole, accounting for his lower back limitation and pain.</block_quote>

[7] Dr. Harris also does not provide any objective findings on which he bases the 10% impairment rating. He merely states that the impairment rating is based upon the claimant's lower back limitation and pain. A medical opinion based solely upon the claimant's history and own subjective belief that a medical condition is related to a compensable injury is not a substitute for credible evidence. <underline>Brewer v. Paragould Housing Authority,</underline> FC Opinion filed Jan. 22, 1996 (<cross_reference>E417617</cross_reference>).

[8] The Court of Appeals, in its opinion, states that if the Commission disregarded the positive straight leg raises as not being objective and measurable findings, this was in error based upon the holding in <underline>Taco Bell v. Finley,</underline><cross_reference>38 Ark. App. 11</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>826 S.W.2d 313</cross_reference> (1992). In that case, the Court found that "observations made by a doctor as a result of range of motion tests qualify as `objective physical findings'." The Court goes on to hold that "Ark. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>11-9-704</cross_reference> (c)(1) does not require either the opinion of Dr. Cutler or Dr. Harris be disregarded by the Commission."

[9] The Commission did not disregard the straight leg raises as not being objective and measurable findings. The Commission accorded these findings the appropriate weight. The Commission has the authority to accept or reject medical opinions and the authority to determine its medical soundness and probative force. <underline>Wasson v. Losey,</underline> <cross_reference>11 Ark. App. 302</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>669 S.W.2d 516</cross_reference> (1984). The only objective and measurable findings are the positive straight leg raises. The September 7, 1993, letter from Dr. Cutler goes on to say:<block_quote>. . . MRIs have been negative. Nerve conduction studies have been mildly abnormal, but are nonspecific and really do not point to a specific etiology, especially in the face of a normal EMG of the lower extremities.</block_quote>

[10] In addition, the statement of Dr. Cutler wherein he states "in view of the paucity of objective findings" indicates that he does not think there are enough objective findings to warrant more than a 5% permanent impairment rating. All diagnostic tests — EMG/nerve conduction study, MRIs, x-rays, and bone scan — were essentially normal. Based upon our <underline>de</underline> <underline>novo</underline> review, the positive straight leg raises are not sufficient objective and measurable findings to assign the claimant any permanent impairment. Accordingly, we find that the claimant has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to any permanent impairment.

[11] The claimant also argues that he is entitled to wage loss. The evidence indicates that the claimant was making approximately $1200 per month as a truck driver. He stated that he wanted to try to be a used car salesman and he would be making approximately $250 to $300 per week. The claimant would be making approximately the same salary as he was driving a truck. He admits that he has not looked for employment elsewhere.

[12] In determining wage loss disability, the Commission may take into consideration the workers' age, education, work experience, medical evidence and any other matters which may reasonably be expected to affect the workers' future earning power. Such other matters are motivation, post-injury income, credibility, and demeanor.<underline>Glass v. Edens,</underline> <cross_reference>233 Ark. 786</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>346 S.W.2d 685</cross_reference> (1961); <underline>City of</underline><underline>Fayetteville v. Guess,</underline> <cross_reference>10 Ark. App. 313</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>663 S.W.2d 946</cross_reference>
(1984). <underline>Curry v. Franklin Electric,</underline> <cross_reference>32 Ark. App. 168</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>798 S.W.2d 130</cross_reference> (1990). The claimant is a relatively young man of 47 who has completed the 11th grade. He has mostly worked as a truck driver. The claimant has stated that he wants to work and is willing to try selling cars. Accordingly, we find that he is not entitled to wage loss.

[13] Therefore, for the reasons discussed herein, we find that the claimant failed to prove by a preponderance of the credible medical evidence that he is entitled to a permanent partial impairment rating or wage loss disability.

[14] IT IS SO ORDERED.
