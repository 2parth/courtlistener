<opinion_byline>  WALLER, PRESIDING JUSTICE, FOR THE COURT:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  ¶ 1. A Democratic Party primary election for the District 2 Supervisor position in Wilkinson County was held on August 5, 2003. Richard Hollins and Edward Kirk Smith were the only two candidates on the ballot. District 2 was created as a result of a redistricting plan approved by the United States Department of Justice, and the primary was the first election held in the new district. The "Fort Adams" precinct and the "Woodville District 2" precinct are both within District 2. When the tallying was completed, the two contenders each had 406 votes. The Wilkinson County Democratic Party Executive Committee did not certify a winner. Instead, a second primary election was held on August 26, 2003. Initially, it appeared that Smith had more votes than Hollins.

  ¶ 2. Hollins filed a petition for judicial review of the election in the Circuit Court of Wilkinson County alleging numerous voting irregularities, including, inter alia, the following: poll managers and workers at both District 2 precincts had not attended training as required by statute; one poll worker called voters who had not voted in the primary and asked them to vote for Smith in the second primary; during the second primary, several persons were denied the right to vote by a "bailiff" because they had not reached the age of 18, when the statute provides that if a person will turn 18 prior to the general election, he or she may vote in the primaries; during the second primary, one of Smith's poll watchers was appointed to be a poll worker at the Woodville District 2 precinct; several ballots cast in favor of Hollins were not counted; and several regular ballots and absentee ballots were improperly rejected.

  ¶ 3. After Smith filed a response and cross-claim alleging fraud against Hollins, we ordered that a special tribunal hold an evidentiary hearing. Both parties called numerous witnesses, including voters, poll workers and the circuit clerk. The individual challenged ballots were entered into evidence.

  ¶ 4. The tribunal found that there was no proof of electoral fraud, that any nonconforming votes were void, and that the election would be determined by the legal votes cast under <bold><italic>Rizzo v. Bizzell</italic></bold>, <cross_reference>530 So. 2d 121</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>128</cross_reference> (Miss. 1988). After examining the challenged ballots and hearing testimony, the tribunal found that six additional votes should be added for Smith and twenty additional votes should be added for Hollins, making the final tally of 516 votes for Smith and 519 votes for Hollins. Hollins was declared the winner of the second primary for the office of Supervisor, Wilkinson County, District 2. Both parties have appealed.

<bold>DISCUSSION</bold>

  ¶ 5. Having carefully inspected each ballot and the corresponding findings in the tribunal's opinion, we find that the tribunal's findings as to the validity or invalidity of the challenged ballots were correct. Many of the ballots were challenged due to redistricting, but the tribunal received evidence and testimony pertaining to the correct precincts for each of these persons and based her findings on this evidence and testimony. Most of the absentee ballots which were challenged because of statutory requirements were correctly determined to be valid.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

  ¶ 6. However, the tribunal erred in its count of the validated ballots. The tribunal added twenty votes to the Hollins total (499 + 20 = 519) and six votes to the Smith total (510 + 6 = 516). <italic>Seventeen</italic> votes<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
should have been added to Hollins' total, and <italic>nine</italic> votes<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> should have been added to Smith's total. <italic>See</italic> attached table of challenged votes. The corrected tally is as follows: Smith, 519 votes (510 + 9 = 519), and Hollins, 516 votes (499 + 17 = 516).

<center>                               <bold>CONCLUSION</bold></center>  ¶ 7. The tribunal is to be commended for sorting through the challenged ballots and validating or invalidating them. However, the tribunal made a clerical error in the final tally, and this clerical error changes the final outcome of the election. The final tally is determined to be 519 votes for Edward Kirk Smith and 516 votes for Richard Hollins. We reverse and render the Tribunal's final tally. Accordingly, a special election shall be called and conducted as provided by applicable law.

  ¶ 8. Miss. Code Ann. § <cross_reference>23-15-937</cross_reference> (Rev. 2001),<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> which governs special elections, provides that the Governor shall call a special election in circumstances such as we have in this case. Hollins shall remain in office until the qualification of the person who wins the special election.

  ¶ 9. We order the Clerk of this Court to send certified copies of this opinion to the Governor of the State of Mississippi, the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi, the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi, each of the Wilkinson County Election Commissioners, the Wilkinson County Board of Supervisors, and the Wilkinson County Circuit Clerk.
