This matter came before the Court sitting <italic>en banc</italic> on the Mississippi Bar's Formal Complaint seeking the disbarment of Charles T. Sykes, Jr., pursuant to Rule 6(a) of the Rules of Discipline for the Bar. Sykes, a member of the Mississippi Bar and subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court and its designated disciplinary agencies, was served with the Formal Complaint on February 18, 1994. Mr. Sykes filed a response answer to the Complaint on March 9, 1994. The Court, having fully considered the Formal Complaint and the response and being fully advised in the premises, finds as follows:

On or about November 23, 1992, Sykes pled guilty and was sentenced to conspiracy to embezzle ERISA funds, a felony violation of <cross_reference>18 U.S.C. ยง 371</cross_reference>, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, in Cause No. S91-00070(G), being Count 1 of a three-count indictment. Pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Discipline, a plea of guilty to a felony mandates automatic disbarment.

Sykes admitted his federal felony conviction in his response to the Formal Complaint of the Mississippi Bar, but sought to have his disbarment effective as of January 1, 1993. The reason given for this request was the Mississippi Bar allegedly unduly delayed the filing of its complaint until<page_number>Page 193</page_number>
February 18, 1994, thereby delaying Sykes' right to apply for re-admission to the bar by one year. The Bar denied prior knowledge of the federal conviction. The majority of the Court voted that Rule 12.1 of the Rules of Discipline requires that the reinstatement petition after disbarment begins to run "after the date the order of disbarment [becomes] final." <italic>MS State Bar v.</italic><italic>Nixon,</italic> <cross_reference>562 So.2d 1288</cross_reference> (Miss. 1990).
