<opinion_text>ORDER

This matter is before the Court upon a petition of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline asking for an order temporarily suspending respondent's license to practice law and seeking the appointment of an attorney to handle all legal matters involving respondent's clients. The petition is granted.

IT IS ORDERED that respondent's license to practice law is temporarily suspended until further order of the Court.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that George W. Branstiter, Esquire, is hereby appointed to assume responsibility for respondent's client files, trust account(s), escrow account(s), operating accounts(s), and any other law office accounts respondent may maintain. Mr. Branstiter shall take action as required by Paragraph 33, Rule 413, SCACR, to protect the interests of respondent's clients. Mr. Branstiter has authority to make disbursements from respondent's trust, escrow, and/or operating account(s) as is reasonably necessary and may apply to the Chairperson of the Board on Grievances and Discipline for authority to make any disbursements that appear to be unusual or out of the ordinary.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order, when served on any bank or other financial institution maintaining trust, escrow and/or operating account(s) of respondent, shall serve as an injunction to prevent respondent from making withdrawals from the account(s) and shall further serve as notice to the bank or other financial institution that George W. Branstiter, Esquire, has been duly appointed by this Court.

This Order shall be made public.
