</opinion_text>
<opinion_byline>   MR. JUSTICE WATTS.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   This is an appeal from an order of his Honor, Judge Smith, refusing to give judgment on a counterclaim set out in the answer of defendant to the complaint in the case to<page_number>Page 332</page_number>
which plaintiff failed to reply and allowing plaintiff to reply to the counterclaim after the time allowed by law had expired. This order is not appealable. It was a matter within the Judge's discretion, and this Court in no view of the case could render a judgment absolute, and, therefore, the order is not appealable.

The order of Judge Smith was based upon the consideration of evidence before him and involved questions of fact.<italic>Blassingame</italic> v. <italic>Greenville County</italic> (May 28, 1917), <cross_reference>106 S.C. 511</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>91 S.E. 861</cross_reference>.

Appeal dismissed.
