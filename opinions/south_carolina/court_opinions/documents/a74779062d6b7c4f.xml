Clerk of The Supreme Court Supreme Court of South Carolina Post Office Box 2138 Columbia, South Carolina 29202

Dear Madame Clerk:

I do hereby resign from the South Carolina Bar effective immediately. I do so reluctantly, but I have not been able to comply with the regulations two and six of the mandatory continuing legal education requirements of the South Carolina Supreme Court and would find it much more honorable to resign than to be suspended from the South Carolina Bar. I feel in the three years that I have been a member of the South Carolina Bar that I have acquitted myself honorably and with integrity and if it should come to pass that I wish to seek re-admittance to the South Carolina Bar, I hope that my application will be favorably looked upon. I have been employed for the last three years as an assistant state attorney for Hillsborough County in Tampa, Florida, and my work as a prosecuting attorney has left little time for the seminars the South Carolina Bar requires.

As I stated above, this resignation is with great reluctance and I hope the Supreme Court of South Carolina will understand my position. It has been my great honor and privilege to have been a member of the South Carolina Bar.

Sincerely yours,

<block_quote>                           /s/ Stuart Sheres Stuart Sheres Assistant State Attorney</block_quote><page_number>Page 591</page_number>
