The South Carolina Bar has proposed amending Rule 410(c)(2), SCACR, to increase the annual license fee for active members by $55. Additionally, because the Legislature has repealed S.C. Code Ann. ยง <cross_reference>40-5-30</cross_reference>, the Bar is no longer required to deposit fees with the State Treasurer. Therefore, the Bar requested that the provision in Rule 410(c)(2) be deleted.

We grant the Bar's request to amend Rule 410(c)(2), SCACR, as set forth in the attachment to this Order. The amendments are effective immediately.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

Jean H. Toal C.J., James E. Moore J., John H. Waller, Jr. J., E. C. Burnett, III J., Costa M. Pleicones J.
