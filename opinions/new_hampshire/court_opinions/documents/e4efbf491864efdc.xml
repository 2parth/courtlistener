<opinion_text>  It was held when this case was here before (Haakensen v. Company,<cross_reference>76 N.H. 443</cross_reference>) that there was evidence for the jury; and as there is now more evidence for the plaintiff, the defendants' motion for a directed verdict was properly denied.

Exception overruled.

All concurred.
