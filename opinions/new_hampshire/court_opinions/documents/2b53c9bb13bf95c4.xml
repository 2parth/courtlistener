<opinion_text>  It was conceded at the argument that there was no legal objection to a physical partition of the premises. Whether the premises can be so divided is a question of fact for the trial court. Laws 1913, c. 21, s. 3. As there appears to be little, if any, doubt<page_number>Page 602</page_number>
