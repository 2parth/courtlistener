<syllabus>A corporation de facto is liable in an action of assumpsit for hired money, notwithstanding a failure to comply with the law in its organization, and its members are not individually liable in such an action if they acted in good faith, believing themselves to be a corporation de jure.

</syllabus>
<posture>  ASSUMPSIT, for money had and received, against "copartners doing business in the name of The Mendocino Flume and Mining Company." Facts found by a referee. The defendants are members of a company which Mann and others undertook to organize as a corporation of that name under Gen. Laws, c. 152, and which is a corporation de facto. The company hired money of the plaintiff, both parties believing the borrower to be a corporation de jury, and understanding that the money was loaned to the company in its corporate capacity.

</posture><attorneys>  J. W. Fellows, for the plaintiff.

B. Wadleagh, for Beal, cited Fay v. Noble, 7 Cush. 188; Trowbridge v. Scudder, 11 Cush. 83; Ward v. Brigham, <cross_reference>127 Mass. 24</cross_reference>.

<opinion_text>  It is not material in this case whether the corporation de facto was a corporation de jure or not. A want of<page_number>Page 185</page_number>
regularity in its organization would not affect the validity of its contract with the plaintiff, and would not give him, against its members, as unincorporated persons, an action on a contract which he made with them as a corporation.
