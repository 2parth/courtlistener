<syllabus>1.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Equality Although the concept of proportionality was foremost in the supreme court's mind in its decision in Manchester v. Auburn, <cross_reference>102 N.H. 325</cross_reference>
(1959), the concept was, and should be, interpreted with reference to its historical use in tax assessment cases and not wrenched into some inflexible, "multiplier" formulation.

2.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Equality For proportionality of tax burdens to be achieved, the properties being compared must be assessed and taxed according to the same criteria.

3.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Reassessments In Manchester v. Auburn, <cross_reference>102 N.H. 325</cross_reference> (1959), the supreme court stated that in order for the revaluation of water supply property to be proportional with the assessed value of other property in the town as required by the statute governing payment in lieu of taxes for municipal<page_number>Page 148</page_number>
water works, such other property in the town being required by the statute governing method of appraisal to be appraised at full and true value, the revaluation of water supply property must likewise be at true value, or in the same ratio thereto as assessed values, if the latter are not at true value. RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>75:1</cross_reference>.

4.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Formulas The supreme court held that the statute governing payment in lieu of taxes for municipal water works does not require the use of a "multiplier method" of valuation; rather it requires that water supply land be valued in accordance with the same principles as are used in assessing the full and true value of any other parcel of property. RSA  <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983).

5.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Formulas On appeal by town from decision of superior court granting city water works a tax abatement for assessments made by the town pursuant to the statute governing payment in lieu of taxes for municipal water works for the years 1980-82 inclusive on the water works' property in the town, where the department of revenue administration had appraised the market value of all the property in the town in 1979 as part of its revaluation of the town, following which the town observed that the fair market value of the taxable land, excluding that of the water works, had increased by a factor of 3.548, while the water works' property had appreciated only by a factor of 1.544, and where the town concluded that this initial appraisal resulted in a disproportionality in favor of the city and therefore used the "multiplier method" to value the water works property, multiplying the 1978 valuation of the property by 3.548 to obtain the valuation which became the basis for the assessment, the supreme court held that the master's reasoning in rejecting the "multiplier method" because of its inherent inadequacies was sound, and that the master made no error of law when he rejected the town's contention that use of the method resulted in a valuation which was presumptively correct. RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983).

6.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Abatements To succeed in being granted an abatement of taxes, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is paying more than his proportional share of taxes.

7.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Determination The statutes of the State are silent about the methods to be used in the valuation of property for taxes, and the supreme court therefore permits considerable leeway.

8.  Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Abatements In abatement petitions the trial court is empowered to make a determination of the subject property's market value, and all evidence before the court relating to valuation should be considered.

9.  Taxation — Appeals — Standards for Review The valuation of property is a question of fact for the trial court, and the supreme court will not overturn its determination so long as there is sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the finding.

10. Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Formulas On appeal by town from decision of superior court granting city water works a tax abatement, the supreme court was convinced that, in<page_number>Page 149</page_number>
determining the fair market value of the water works' property located in the town, the master undertook his analysis of valuation by use of the development method as a means of testing the accuracy of the three appraisals he had before him, and only after the town's appraiser interjected its use in the proceedings, and the court held that his use of the development method was proper in the circumstances and was supported by the evidence.

11. Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Fair Market Value On appeal by town from decision of superior court granting city water works a tax abatement, where the city owned approximately 3,847 acres of land located in the town in the watershed of a lake used as a source of the city's water supply, and where one parcel of the land consisted of approximately 1,364 acres bordering the lake, with other parcels located in the immediate vicinity of the lake, and further, where the city had restricted the use of the lake to fishing and boating, allowing no swimming, water skiing or similar activities, the supreme court held that the master did not err in considering the use restrictions in his finding of the full and true value of the property, where he had found that the value of the parcels of land influenced by the lake would be approximately 25% higher if there were no restrictions on the use of the lake, and that the restrictions had been imposed by the city, had been in existence for many years, and could be removed without legal impediment, since the restrictions against activities on the lake were not restrictions on the subject property itself, and since the restrictions unquestionably would affect the sale value of the land and there was no evidence of any water supply source which once having been closed to swimming was rededicated to said use, and the court could conclude on the basis of the master's finding that even if the city were to sell its property, it would not cease to use the lake as the primary source of potable water, and the would-be buyer would take subject to such restrictions.

12. Taxation — Appraisal and Assessment — Findings On appeal by town from a decision of the superior court granting city water works a tax abatement, the supreme court held that the master's valuation of the water works' property was supported by the evidence, where he concluded that the property had a fair market value on April 1, 1980, of $6,170,500, the same figure at which the city's expert appraiser valued the property.

<opinion_text>  This is an appeal from a decision of the superior court granting the Manchester Water Works, a subdivision of the plaintiff, the City of Manchester (city), a tax abatement. See RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983); RSA <cross_reference>75:15</cross_reference>
(Supp. 1983). The city had petitioned for an abatement of assessments made pursuant to RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983) by the defendant, the Town of Auburn (town), for the<page_number>Page 150</page_number>
years 1980-82 inclusive on the Water Works' property in the town. In a lengthy report, the Master (R. Peter Shapiro, Esq.) valued the Water Works' property and recommended that its payments be abated. The Superior Court (Bean, J.) approved the report and issued an order in accordance therewith. We affirm.

The Water Works owns and operates a drinking-water treatment facility in the city on the westerly shore of Lake Massabesic. The city has utilized the lake as a source of its water supply for more than one hundred years. Over time, the city has purchased substantial acreage within the watershed of Lake Massabesic to protect the integrity of its water supply.

In the watershed, the city owns approximately 3,847 acres located in the town. Of this land, one parcel consisting of approximately 1,364 acres borders the lake. Other parcels are located in the immediate vicinity of the lake. The surface of the lake extends over some 2,512 acres, most of which lies within the town.

The master found that the city had restricted the use of the lake to fishing and boating, allowing no swimming, water skiing or similar activities. He described the shoreline as being predominantly rocky but with occasional wooded areas, sandy beaches, marshes, and areas that front public highways.

As part of its revaluation of the town in 1979, the New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration (department) conducted an appraisal of the market value of all the property in the town, including the city's property. On the basis of the department's valuation of the Water Works' property at $18,094,800, the defendant billed the city pursuant to RSA<cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983) for payments in lieu of taxes. Based upon a tax rate of $14.70 per thousand and an equalization ratio of 93.5 percent, the bill for 1980 was for $265,993.56.

The Water Works made its 1980 payment under protest and filed a petition to abate in the superior court. A second petition was later filed, directed at the 1981 levy. During the course of trial on these petitions, the parties agreed that the action would be treated as one for abatement of the 1982 payment as well, and that any finding of disproportionality for 1980 would also apply to 1981 and 1982. In addition, it was agreed that with respect to all three tax years at issue, an equalization ratio of 93.5 percent would apply to the master's valuation of the subject property.

By agreeing to this equalization ratio, the parties, in effect, agreed that, on average, all taxable property in the town of Auburn (other than the Water Works' property) had been assessed at 93.5 percent of its full and true value in money as of April 1, 1980. See RSA <cross_reference>75:1</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983); Stevens v. City of Lebanon, <cross_reference>122 N.H. 29</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>32-33</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>440 A.2d 451</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>453-54</cross_reference>
(1982). Since the equalization ratio and the<page_number>Page 151</page_number>
tax rates for the years in question were agreed upon, the only issue for the trial court to resolve was whether the valuation of the subject property by the town was in accordance with the dictates of RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference>
(Supp. 1983).

RSA chapter 72 is captioned: "Persons and Property Liable to Taxation." The pertinent section relative to the taxation of waterworks and flood control property held by one municipality within another municipality is RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983), which provides:

<block_quote>    "Water Works; Flood Control. Property held by a city, town or district in another city or town for the purpose of a water supply or flood control, if yielding no rent, shall not be liable to taxation therein, but the city, town or district so holding it shall annually pay to the city or town in which such property lies an amount equal to that which such place would receive for taxes upon the average of the assessed value of such land, without buildings or other structures, for the 3 years last preceding legal process to acquire the same, or other acquisition thereof, the valuation for each year being reduced by all abatements thereon; but any part of such land or buildings from which any revenue in the nature of rent is received shall be subject to taxation; such payments shall be paid to the collector of taxes of the town or city in which such property lies upon notification from him, and such payment shall be made on or before December 1 in each year; provided, however, that after such acquisition the valuation thus established shall be subject to change, as to make such value proportional with the assessed value of other property in the town which is subject to taxation, so that such payment will not exceed its proportion of the public charge in that year. Any city or town aggrieved by the payment in lieu of taxes on such property shall have the same right of appeal as a taxpayer may have."</block_quote>

(Emphasis added.)

The evidence adduced at trial indicates that the town's assessment for 1980 was based on a so-called "multiplier method" of valuation, which method the town had urged upon the department as being consistent with the interpretation of RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983) made by this court in Manchester v. Auburn, <cross_reference>102 N.H. 325</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>156 A.2d 774</cross_reference> (1959). The department had initially appraised the subject property as having a fair market value in 1979 of $7,880,100. After receiving this appraisal, a selectman for the town asked the director of the department's property appraisal division to reconsider its appraisal.<page_number>Page 152</page_number>
Following discussions with the selectman and counsel for the town, the department reappraised the Water Works' property, using the "multiplier method," and arrived at the figure of $18,094,800.

The town argues that the use of the "multiplier method" is supported by RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983) and our interpretation of that statute in Manchester v. Auburn. The town grounds its argument on the contention that the keystone to assessments of water supply property is proportionality. It then reasons that for the city's tax burden to remain proportional to that borne by other taxpayers, the valuation of the Water Works' property must directly reflect the ratio by which the assessed values of other taxable property have increased or decreased from year to year.

Following the department's appraisal of the town in 1979, the town observed that the fair market value of taxable land, excluding that of the Water Works, increased from $5,390,550 to $19,127,298 between 1978 and 1979, or by a factor of 3.548, while the Water Works' property appreciated from $5,100,650 to $7,880,100, or only by a factor of 1.544. Because it concluded that the initial appraisal resulted in a disproportionality in favor of the city, the town argued that its "multiplier method" of valuation would rectify this disproportionality.

The application of the "multiplier method" to the Water Works' property entailed taking the 1978 valuation of the subject property and multiplying it by 3.548, the factor by which all other taxable land in the town of Auburn had appreciated. The application of this formula ($5,100,650 x 3.548) produced $18,094,800, the valuation which, in turn, became the basis for the defendant's 1980 assessment of the property.

The town justifies the application of this "multiplier method" by pointing to the following language in Manchester v. Auburn:

<block_quote>    "If following the acquisition of water supply properties by the plaintiff, the true or market values of taxable properties in the town increased, quite apart from any increment of value attributable to improvement of such property, and thereby produced increased tax assessments, the amended statute requires that the original valuation of the water supply properties, based on historical assessments presumably proportional to other assessments at that time, shall be increased in proportion to any subsequent rise in assessed values of properties which remained taxable . . . . [W]hen reference to increases in the true and market value of taxable property is made, increases due to inflation or to the devaluation of the dollar are meant,<page_number>Page 153</page_number>
and not increases resulting from development of the taxable property by new construction or the like."</block_quote>

Id. at 332, 156 A.2d at 781 (emphasis added).

According to the town, the court explained the statutory reference to "proportional" by use of the following example: "If assessments increased ten percent, then the valuations of water supply property shall be increased proportionally." Id. at 330, 156 A.2d at 779.

[1-3] We agree with the city that the town has read Manchester v. Auburn selectively. Although the concept of proportionality was foremost in the court's mind, the concept was, and should be, interpreted with reference to its historical use in tax assessment cases and not wrenched into some inflexible, "multiplier" formulation. See, e.g., Ainsworth v. Claremont,<cross_reference>106 N.H. 85</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>88</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>205 A.2d 356</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>358</cross_reference> (1964) ("if each property is appraised at the same proportion to its full and true value, . . . the resulting taxes must be proportional"). For proportionality of tax burdens to be achieved, the properties being compared must be assessed and taxed according to the same criteria. We realized this in Manchester v. Auburn, and we said so:

<block_quote>    "In order for the revaluation to be `proportional with the assessed value of other property in the town' (RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference>) which is required by RSA <cross_reference>75:1</cross_reference> to be appraised at `full and true value,' the revaluation of water supply property must likewise be at true value, or in the same ratio thereto as assessed values, if the latter are not at true value."</block_quote>

Manchester v. Auburn, <cross_reference>102 N.H. at 333</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>156 A.2d at 781</cross_reference>; see also id. at 330, 156 A.2d at 779-80 ("the annual charge [called for by RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference>] is to be determined on the basis of periodic valuations . . . to make the value proportional to assessments for taxation, which involves use of the same general method employed in making assessments." (Emphasis added.)).

[4, 5] Accordingly, we hold that RSA <cross_reference>72:11</cross_reference> (Supp. 1983) does not require the use of a "multiplier method" of valuation; rather, it requires that water supply land be valued in accordance with the same principles as are used in assessing the full and true value of any other parcel of property. Furthermore, we hold that the master's reasoning in rejecting the "multiplier method," because of that method's inherent inadequacies, was sound. The master wrote:

<block_quote>    "The fact that land, exclusive of buildings, and not owned by plaintiff increased in value from 1979 to 1980, by a factor of 3.548, may have some bearing on the increase in value of plaintiff's property from 1979 to 1980. This is<page_number>Page 154</page_number>
certainly a factor the Master may consider in establishing the plaintiff's `full and true value' of its property. Defendant's analysis presupposes that the cause of the increase in value is inflation which applies equally to all property. There may be many other factors which affect the value of property and cause it to increase or decrease. The location of roads, utilities, public amenities such as schools, parks, hospitals and libraries will increase the value of land. On the other hand, the location of industry, waste sites, and commercial areas could decrease land values. Government action such as zoning can affect the value of land. Also, as a community is developed, the demand and supply of land for specific uses changes. All of these factors must be considered as elements of the increase in value of land in Auburn from 1979 to 1980. As a practical matter, the Master considered the fact that there was an increase in land values in Auburn from 1979 to 1980. However, there were many other matters given greater weight in the final analysis of the `full and true value' of plaintiff's land."</block_quote>

Accordingly, the master made no error of law when he rejected the town's contention that use of the "multiplier method" resulted in a valuation which was presumptively correct.

We turn to the question of the adequacy of the master's finding of the fair market value of the Water Works' property. The town raises several claims of error regarding the master's methodology and his resulting valuation.

[6-9] To succeed in being granted an abatement of taxes, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is paying more than his proportional share of taxes. Martinonis v. Town of Kingston, <cross_reference>124 N.H. 304</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>306</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>469 A.2d 1332</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1333</cross_reference> (1983); Clark v. Middleton, <cross_reference>74 N.H. 188</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>66 A. 115</cross_reference> (1907). "The statutes of the State are silent about the methods to be used in the valuation of property for taxes, and this court therefore permits considerable leeway." Appeal of Anderson,<cross_reference>120 N.H. 749</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>751</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>422 A.2d 1043</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1045</cross_reference> (1980). "In abatement petitions the trial court is empowered to make a determination of the subject property's market value . . . and all evidence before the court relating to valuation should be considered." Brickman v. City of Manchester, <cross_reference>119 N.H. 919</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>920</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>409 A.2d 1328</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1329-30</cross_reference> (1979) (citations omitted). The valuation of property is a question of fact for the trial court, and we shall not overturn its determination so long as there is sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the finding. Town of<page_number>Page 155</page_number>
Croydon v. Current Use Advisory Bd., <cross_reference>121 N.H. 442</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>446</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>431 A.2d 126</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>129</cross_reference>
(1981).

The master concluded that the Water Works' property had a fair market value on April 1, 1980, of $6,170,500, the same figure at which the plaintiff's expert appraiser valued the property. Initially, after considering the topography of the property and the pertinent zoning restrictions, the master found that the "highest and best use," 590 Realty Co., Ltd. v. City of Keene, <cross_reference>122 N.H. 284</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>285</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>444 A.2d 535</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>536</cross_reference> (1982), of the property would be as residential property. This finding was supported by evidence produced by both parties.

The master then considered the three standard approaches to determining value and properly concluded that the cost approach and the income approach were of little help in appraising the subject property. Cf. Steele v. Town of Allenstown, <cross_reference>124 N.H. 487</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>490</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>471 A.2d 1179</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1181</cross_reference> (1984). The master then ruled that the sales comparison, or market data, approach was the most appropriate method for valuing the subject property. This method compares the subject property with similar properties which have been offered for sale or sold in recent times at known prices.

There are obvious shortcomings in this approach when used to value the Water Works' property, for, as the master observed, the "subject property is as unique a holding as one could find." Consequently, the likelihood of finding truly comparable sales is slight. Instead, sales of parcels generally similar to parts of the subject property must be used, with significant adjustments made to their prices to account for the dissimilarities between them and their counterparts within the subject property. The trial record in this case largely reflects the parties' attempts to derive, from the market data, figures that truly reflect the value of the various segments of the subject property.

The city's expert appraiser divided the property into 31 economic units and then appraised each by reference to sales of comparable property, making adjustments for time, location, size, topography, and access, as well as other distinguishing characteristics. He used price per acre as the unit of comparison. The town's expert appraised the land surrounding the lake on a shorefront-foot basis and the remaining land on an acreage basis. Also in evidence was the original appraisal made by the department, which divided the property into three areas that were analyzed separately: areas with (1) lake frontage and (2) road frontage and (3) frontage on neither the lake nor roads.

The area of greatest divergence among the three appraisals in evidence is the valuation of the land influenced by water frontage, with the dollar values placed on the so-called "back land" by the<page_number>Page 156</page_number>
appraisals differing only by approximately ten percent. The town's appraisal arrived at a fair market value, for that portion of the property with lake frontage, of $17,609,900, out of a total valuation of $19,475,000. The department's estimate for lake frontage property was $6,057,300, out of a total valuation of $6,636,550. The value placed on the subject property by the plaintiff's expert was $6,170,500.

In his report, the master considered the three expert appraisals, all of which relied on market data or sales comparisons to support their conclusions. In considerable detail, he analyzed and critiqued each appraisal, while recognizing the formidable task each appraiser faced in comparing property sold elsewhere to the subject property. The master then proceeded "to assess the relative merits of the appraisals" and to attempt to reconcile their valuations by reference to the "development method" of estimating fair market value.

The town's main criticism of the master's approach is directed at his use of the development method. The town argues that the master, by extending his review beyond the evidence and the three accepted approaches to valuation and by undertaking his own appraisal by use of the development method, exceeded his authority and committed reversible error. The plaintiff rebuts these contentions and defends the master's analysis by stating that the master used the development approach only as a means to "check" the relative merits of the three appraisals, and that he used the method in a way that was proper and supported by the evidence.

Reduced to its basics, the development method of approximating the fair market value of raw undeveloped land entails anticipating an ultimate developed use for the land. In terms of its methodology, value for the land once it has been improved is estimated based on a market data approach, and from this figure is subtracted the costs that are needed in order to create the improvements, including a figure for the cost of money and a figure representing a fair profit on the sale of the improved property. The resulting figure represents the value of the land, in its raw state, to the developer.

Before undertaking his analysis, the master stated: "The development method was utilized in the appraisers' review of the subject property." He concluded his analysis by stating: "The Master finds that the `Development Method' does not support the fair market value of [the town's appraiser] and is consistent with that of [the city's appraiser]." Accordingly, he adopted the value that the plaintiff's appraiser ascribed to the subject property.

As part of his appraisal, the town's appraiser utilized a development method to test the accuracy of his market data approach. His<page_number>Page 157</page_number>
testimony at trial indicated that his use of the development method differed from the method outlined in the American Institute of Real Estate Appraiser's Handbook on the Appraisal of Real Estate. This admission opened the way for considerable criticism of the town's appraisal, most notably by the plaintiff's witness, Emil Hanslin. Hanslin, an internationally known developer, gave his opinion of the price at which a developer would consider purchasing the subject property for purposes of developing it into residential lots. That price approximated the value found by the master.

As part of his testimony leading to his opinion, Hanslin criticized the defendant's appraisal for failure to take into consideration expenditures for numerous items that would have to be procured or constructed in order to subdivide the subject property into residential lots. Hanslin also faulted the town's appraiser for not fully considering the problems associated with marketing these lots. The master's utilization of the development method differs most noticeably from the town's appraiser's use of that method in his consideration of items which Hanslin and other witnesses argued would weigh heavily in the mind of a potential buyer and thus would significantly affect the selling price of the subject property.

[10] We are convinced that the master undertook his development analysis as a means of testing the accuracy of the appraisals he had before him, and only after the town's appraiser interjected its use in the proceedings. His use of this method was proper in the circumstances and was supported by the evidence.

The town's final claim of error is directed at the master's treatment of the restrictions on activities in Lake Massabesic. The master granted the following request for a finding propounded by the city: "If there were no restrictions on the use of Lake Massabesic the value of the parcels influenced by the Lake would be approximately 25% higher than the values which [the city's appraiser] estimated for those parcels." The master further found that "[t]his restriction was imposed by the City of Manchester (Water Department) and has been in existence for many years. There is no legal impediment to the removal of said restriction."

The town maintains that because of these findings, the master erred in not increasing the value of the land affected by the lake (as estimated by the city), inasmuch as self-imposed restrictions on the use of property may not properly be taken into account in valuing that property. See NeBoShone Assn. v. Tax Comm., <cross_reference>58 Mich. App. 324</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>334</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>227 N.W.2d 358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>363</cross_reference> (1975); cf. Demoulas v. Town of Salem, <cross_reference>116 N.H. 775</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>782</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>367 A.2d 588</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>593</cross_reference> (1976) (long-term leases); Trustees of the Phillips-Exeter Academy v. Exeter,<cross_reference>92 N.H. 473</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>487</cross_reference>,<page_number>Page 158</page_number><cross_reference>33 A.2d 665</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>674</cross_reference> (1943) ("uses dependent upon the personal element of the user are not an element of the property in its transfer, payment for which is the keynote of value").

Our response to the defendant's argument is straightforward: The restrictions against activities on the lake, whatever be their source, are not restrictions on the subject property itself. Unquestionably, the restrictions would affect the value of the land were a sale to take place, and the master found that "[t]here was no evidence of any water supply source which once having been closed to swimming was rededicated to said use. There is little, if any, prospect of Lake Massabesic being open to swimming in the near future." On the basis of this finding, we may conclude that even if the city were to sell its property, it would not cease to use the lake as the primary source of potable water, and the would-be buyer would take subject to said restrictions.
