<posture>  APPEAL from a judgment of the circuit court for Douglas county:  CARL H. DALEY, Circuit Judge.  <italic>Reversed and remanded</italic>.

</posture>
<opinion_text>  The complaint in this action seeks a declaratory judgment determining the rights of the parties.  The defendant has demurred to the complaint.  The trial court found in favor of the plaintiff.  The parties stipulated to the entry of a judgment, subject to the defendant's right of appeal.  The entire record in this case consists of the complaint, demurrer, the findings, the judgment, and the stipulation regarding appeal.

The plaintiff operates a high school in the town of Iron River, Bayfield county.  The defendant operates a high school in the town of Maple, Douglas county.  Fourteen students who live and reside in the town of Iron River, where the plaintiff operates its high school, attend the high school operated by the town of Maple.

The plaintiff claims that sec. 40.91 (1), Stats., prohibits the defendant from allowing said students to attend its high school.  Sec. 40.91 provides:

"(1) <italic>Admission of nonresidents</italic>.  The board shall admit to the high school, when facilities will warrant, any person of school age who resides in the state, but not within any high-school district, and who has complied with the entrance requirements.  Nonresidents so admitted shall be entitled to the same privileges and be subject to the same rules and regulations as resident pupils."

Sec. 40.654, Stats., provides:

"Before the admission of any nonresidents to a public elementary or high school the board shall make a written agreement with the parents for the payment of tuition at the rate legally fixed, except when the tuition is a public charge."

<opinion_text>  Upon the demurrer to the complaint, the trial judge declared the law to be as follows:  A school district may not admit to its high school those pupils who reside within another school district which operates a high school.

The trial judge determined that sec. 40.91 (1), Stats., means that "a high-school district has no right to admit pupils who come from another high-school district or school district which is maintaining a high school."  We reach a contrary conclusion.

In <italic>requiring</italic> school districts to admit certain nonresidents, the statute does not thereby <italic>prohibit</italic> the admission of other nonresidents.  In other words, because the statute affirmatively requires the admission of a student from a district which does not have a high school it cannot be said to proscribe the admission of a person who resides in a district where there is a high school.

This conclusion is buttressed by the provisions of sec. 40.654, Stats.  This section provides that before the admission of a nonresident pupil there must be a written agreement entered into with the parents providing for their payment of nonresident tuition, except in those cases where the tuition is made a public charge.  Sec. 40.91 is an instance where high-school tuition is made a public charge.  A correlation of secs. 40.91 and 40.654 requires the conclusion that a school district may, if it chooses, accept a high-school pupil from some other district even though such pupil's home district operates a high school, provided the necessary parental<page_number>Page 412</page_number>
agreement to pay nonresident tuition is made.  We believe that these two sections reflect legislative recognition of the right of a school district to determine if its facilities permit it to admit a high-school student who resides in another district, even though the latter has a high school.

We are satisfied that the plaintiff had a legally protectible interest so as to justify its maintaining this action.  <italic>State ex</italic><italic>rel. La Follette v. Dammann</italic> (1936), <cross_reference>220 Wis. 17</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>264 N.W. 627</cross_reference>.  Nevertheless, we conclude that under a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes the plaintiff has misconstrued its rights.

<italic>By the Court</italic>. — Judgment reversed and remanded.  Judgment to be entered declaring that the defendant has authority to admit high-school students to its high school even though said students reside in the high-school district of the plaintiff, which latter district maintains a high school.
