</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Alice Thompson appeals a summary judgment that dismissed her tort lawsuit for negligent hiring of an employee against Jay Blahnik and his liability insurer, Heritage Mutual Insurance Company.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Her lawsuit sought damages against Blahnik for the burglary and sexual assault Matthew Dirden committed in her home. Dirden learned of her residence while allegedly working as a mechanic at Blahnik's auto repair shop, where Thompson's car was awaiting repairs. Thompson claimed that Blahnik negligently hired someone of Dirden's character and negligently gave Dirden access to Thompson's address. The trial court ruled that Dirden was not an employee and that Blahnik could not have foreseen Dirden's crimes. The trial court correctly granted summary judgment if Blahnik showed no dispute of material fact and a right to judgment as a matter of law. <bold><italic>Powalka v.

(1972). We reject Thompson's arguments and affirm the summary judgment.

Even if we assume arguendo that Dirden qualified as Blahnik's employee, which we do not decide, Thompson has proposed a cause of action that violates fundamental principles of Wisconsin tort law. Wisconsin has not recognized a cause of action for negligent hiring, at least concerning the hiring of nonfiduciary employees or other employees whose services endear no fiduciary-like trust from customers in the sense that those of therapists or clergy might generate. An auto mechanic's services occasion no fiduciary-like trust or equivalent reposing of faith. Moreover, holding Blahnik liable for Dirden's rape and burglary would make poor public policy. It would impose liability disproportionate to Blahnik's culpability, levy too great a burden on the tortfeasor, compensate for an injury that was remote from Blahnik's alleged negligence, and would put Wisconsin tort law and the judiciary into a field with no apparent stopping point. <italic>See</italic><bold><italic>Coffey v.

Wisconsin will not recognize causes of action under such circumstances. In sum, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment.
