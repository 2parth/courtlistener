<posture>  ERROR to review a judgment of the circuit court for Milwaukee county:  ROBERT H. GOLLMAR, Reserve Circuit Judge, Presiding.  <italic>Affirmed</italic>.

</posture>
<opinion_text>  James G. Klonowski, herein called the defendant, was convicted of the crime of sexual intercourse with a child, contrary to sec. 944.10(1), Stats., and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of not more than five years.  A writ of error has been issued to review the judgment of conviction.

On April 14, 1973, the complaining witness, then sixteen years old, was hitchhiking in the vicinity of North Water Street and East Wisconsin Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, between 11 and 11:30 p.m.  James Klonowski, the defendant, and two other males, all adults, picked her up and drove onto the Milwaukee county freeway system.  The three men had sexual intercourse with the girl in the back seat of the car as it was being driven around Milwaukee county.  The girl was dropped off at around 5:30 a.m. on April 15, 1973.

The defendant had told the girl that he had done a similar thing with another girl from her high school and he had gotten in a lot of trouble for it because she was a "snitch" and had told on him.

On April 15, 1973, the defendant was arrested at 1:45 p.m.  On that same day, an application was made to Judge MARVIN C. HOLZ for a search warrant.  Deputy<page_number>Page 606</page_number>
James Krause of the sheriff's department testified that he had spoken with the complaining witness at 8:30 a.m. that day.  She told him that she had been sexually assaulted, raped and made to commit oral sex.  The act occurred while driving on the freeway in Milwaukee county.  She explained to Krause how she had been picked up while hitchhiking and the subsequent events.  She was taken to the Milwaukee city bureau of identification and shown 20 photographs from which she picked out a photograph of the defendant as being a picture of one of the individuals involved.  She also described the vehicle involved as being white with black interior.  There was a tape deck mounted under the dashboard and one interior light which was on the driver's side of the automobile toward the rear window.  Krause went to the Klonowski residence at 5672 So. 27th Street in Milwaukee and saw a vehicle matching the description in the garage. Deputy Krause was on the premises at approximately 1:45 p.m. for the purpose of taking the defendant into custody and saw the vehicle because the garage door was open.  In addition to the tape deck, there was reason to believe that there may be blood on the rear seat of the automobile and that a Tampax removed from the girl at the time of the incident might be in the car.  The vehicle seen in the Klonowski garage was a 1967 Ford, license number R35-228, registered to Universal Oil Company, which company is owned by the defendant's father.

On the basis of this, Judge HOLZ issued a search warrant for a search of the garage at 5672 So. 27th Street, Milwaukee, for:

"a 1967 Ford, two door hardtop, license number R35-228, Wisconsin 1973:  to seize said automobile and convey same to the Milwaukee County Sheriff's garage, 821 W. State St., to examine said auto particularly for a tape deck, placement of interior light bulbs, the existence of any bloodstains and any Tampax or similar type of<page_number>Page 607</page_number>
female sanitary napkin and such other evidence as may be found. . . ."

A three-man team from the state crime laboratory searched the automobile at 7:15 p.m. that same evening. The following items were found and taken to the crime laboratory in Madison: a comb, the right-front door handle, a tape cassette, a sanitary napkin, a small bunny, a hair brush, the rear seat, hair and sweepings from various parts of the interior of the automobile.

When the defendant was arrested on Sunday, April 15, 1973, at 1:15 p.m. he was advised of his constitutional rights.  He said he understood them and did not want to talk to the arresting officers.  There was no interrogation by the arresting officers.

On the following day, April 16th, the girl was again interviewed by the sheriff's deputies at their office. While she was there, she saw the defendant as he was being taken into another room.  She informed the officers that he was one of the men involved.

Following this confrontation, which occurred shortly after noon on April 16th, the defendant was conveyed to Milwaukee County General Hospital for saliva and blood specimens.  After the samples were taken, the defendant and Deputy Robert Scopoline, Jr., went to the hospital's snack bar where the deputy bought the defendant a cup of coffee and offered him a cigarette.  They talked of matters other than this case and the defendant said: "They got me charged with rape; it wasn't a rape." Deputy Scopoline then told him that he did not have to talk to him and advised him of his right to remain silent and to an attorney.  The defendant said he wanted to get it off his chest and told the deputy his story.  He admitted having had sexual intercourse with the girl but stated she was not forced to do it.

The defendant repeated his story after Deputy Krause arrived while the two deputies were conveying him back<page_number>Page 608</page_number>
to the sheriff's department.  The defendant was reminded that he had been advised of his constitutional rights but said: "I'm sorry, I'd like to apologize for all the trouble you went through, but I want to tell the truth."  He then repeated his story and said the girl was cooperative. They arrived back at the safety building at 4 p.m.

A criminal complaint was filed on April 17, 1973, charging the defendant with the crime of having sexual intercourse with a child.  He was taken before a magistrate that day.  Motions to suppress evidence were made by the defendant.  These motions included motions to suppress the identification testimony of the girl as to both the photographic and the subsequent personal confrontation, to suppress the oral statements made by the defendant, and to suppress physical evidence obtained in the search of the automobile.  Motions were denied.

On March 26, 1974, the defendant requested to change his plea from not guilty to guilty.  The change of plea was accepted and defendant was found guilty and sentenced.

<opinion_text>  Two issues are presented on this appeal:

1.  Did the trial court err in denying the motion to suppress statements made by the defendant?

2.  Did the trial court err in denying the motion to suppress certain evidence found in the automobile but not particularly described in the search warrant?

<table>
<italic>Unreasonable detention</italic>.
</table>
The defendant's first argument is that the statements he made on the afternoon of April 16, 1973, should have<page_number>Page 609</page_number>
been suppressed as being statements made during an unreasonable detention before he was brought before a magistrate.

In <italic>Phillips v. State</italic> (1966), <cross_reference>29 Wis.2d 521</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>534</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>535</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>139 N.W.2d 41</cross_reference>, this court said:

". . . [T]he right to interrogate after arrest is limited and must be for the purpose of determining whether to release the suspect or if he has been arrested without warrant to make a formal complaint. . . .  A detention for a period longer than is reasonably necessary for such limited purpose violates due process and renders inadmissible any confession obtained during the unreasonable period of the detention."

It was further said (p. 535):

". . . While one may be detained by the police and interrogated to secure sufficient evidence to either charge him with a crime or to release him, the police cannot continue to detain an arrested person to `sew up' the case by obtaining or extracting a confession or culpable statements to support the arrest or the guilt. . . ."

In <italic>Krueger v. State</italic> (1972), <cross_reference>53 Wis.2d 345</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>357</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>192 N.W.2d 880</cross_reference>, this court clarified the <italic>Phillips</italic> rule against "sew-up" confessions:

". . . A confession does not become inadmissible as a `sew-up' confession merely because the state, prior to the confession, had information sufficient to sustain a charge. The question revolves solely on the point whether the delay was inordinate and the detention illegal. . . ."

This rule was recently reiterated in <italic>McAdoo v. State</italic>
(1974), <cross_reference>65 Wis.2d 596</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>609</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>223 N.W.2d 521</cross_reference>:

"Any statement, even if voluntarily given by an accused, will be held inadmissible if made during a period of unreasonably long detention.  <italic>State v. Estrada</italic> (1974),<cross_reference>63 Wis.2d 476</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>490</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>217 N.W.2d 359</cross_reference>; <italic>State v. Wallace,</italic><italic>supra</italic>, page 75; <italic>State v. Hunt</italic> (1972), <cross_reference>53 Wis.2d 734</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>741</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>193 N.W.2d 858</cross_reference>."<page_number>Page 610</page_number>

While these cases indicate that any confession made during an unreasonably long detention are inadmissible, there are cases stating that the purpose of the rule is to prevent an accused from having his resistance weakened by the psychological coercion of being detained and "worked upon" by the police to secure evidence.  <italic>Embry</italic><italic>v. State</italic> (1970), <cross_reference>46 Wis.2d 151</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>160</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>174 N.W.2d 521</cross_reference>. In <italic>Davis v. State</italic> (1967), <cross_reference>33 Wis.2d 682</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>684</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>148 N.W.2d 53</cross_reference>, it was said that <italic>Phillips v. State:, supra</italic>, ". . . related to so-called `sew-up' confessions wherein an accused has been interrogated for a long period of time before being brought before a magistrate."

In <italic>Reimers v. State</italic> (1966), <cross_reference>31 Wis.2d 457</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>143 N.W.2d 525</cross_reference>, this court was confronted with a contention that three statements should be excluded under the <italic>Phillips</italic>
rule.  In that case, the defendant turned himself in at the jail at about 11:55 p.m. on November 9, 1963, telling the undersheriff he wanted to make a statement.  He was "booked" and placed in a cell because the undersheriff was too busy at the time.  After investigating the incident involved, the sheriff got the defendant up at 1:30 a.m. and took a statement from the defendant which was written down by the undersheriff and signed by the defendant.  The next morning, the statement was typed and then signed by the defendant.  On the morning of November 12, 1963, a third statement was given at the request of the defendant.  This court noted that "Upon its face, a detention from midnight Saturday until 10 a.m. Tuesday, without satisfactory explanation, would be unreasonable." (p. 470) This court refused to exclude the third statement for two reasons, either of which would have been sufficient to sustain the statement's admissibility:

"First, it was taken at the request of the defendant, and second, the statement does not refer to the incidents of the crimes for which he was convicted." (p. 470)<page_number>Page 611</page_number>

It is the first reason given in <italic>Reimers</italic> which is relied upon by the state here.

The second contention of the state is that <italic>Phillips</italic>
should only be applied where the unreasonable period of detention has been used by the police as an occasion to "work upon" the defendant in order to secure a "sew-up" confession.  This is the real evil which the <italic>Phillips</italic> Case sought to correct.

In a recent decision, the Michigan Supreme Court reiterated its rule that:

"Only when the delay has been employed as a tool to extract a statement has an exclusionary rule been imposed. . . ."<italic>People v. White</italic> (1974), <cross_reference>392 Mich. 404</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>424</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>221 N.W.2d 357</cross_reference>.

There the court noted that the defendant had requested to make one of the statements in question more than thirty hours after his arrest, but before he was brought before a magistrate.

In this case, the defendant volunteered a statement without being subjected to any interrogation.  The defendant and a deputy sheriff were having a cup of coffee at the county hospital when the defendant stated:  "They got me charged with rape; it wasn't rape."  The deputy immediately advised the defendant of his rights, but he indicated he wanted to make the statement.  Since the statement was not made in response to any interrogation, it is a volunteered statement.

We conclude that the statement in question is not subject to the exclusionary rule under Phillips for two reasons:  First, it was a volunteered statement taken at the request of the defendant, and second, it was not the result of the defendant's being "worked upon" by the officers in order to obtain a "sew-up" confession.  Very little, if any, questioning of defendant had taken place prior to his making the statement.  The trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion to suppress his statement.<page_number>Page 612</page_number>

<table>
<italic>Search of the automobile</italic>.
</table>
The defendant does not challenge the issuance of the search warrant or the seizure of the automobile.  Rather, he contends that the court should have suppressed certain items found in the automobile and taken to the state crime laboratory which were not particularly described in the search warrant.

The search warrant provided for the seizure of the automobile and the conveying of it to the sheriff's garage and the examining of it, "particularly for a tape deck, placement of the interior light bulbs, the existence of any bloodstains and any Tampax or similar type of female sanitary napkin and such other evidence as may be found."  Objection is to only certain items listed as being found in the inventory and turned over to the state crime laboratory.  These items are the sweepings, the comb, the hair brush, the hair, the eyeglass lens, the small bunny and the door handle.  No objection is raised as to the rear seat, the tape cassette or the sanitary napkin found in the vehicle.

The defendant makes two arguments in support of his contention that the items seized pursuant to the search warrant should have been excluded from evidence.  First, he argues that the search warrant failed to meet the particularity requirement of the fourth amendment that ". . . no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

Also, the defendant contends that under <italic>Myers v. State</italic>
(1973), <cross_reference>60 Wis.2d 248</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>208 N.W.2d 311</cross_reference>, the items objected to could not be seized under this search warrant because they were not particularly described and did not meet the four requirements set forth in that case.  In<italic>Myers</italic>, this court said (p. 261):

"In <italic>United States v. McDonnell</italic> (D.C. Neb. 1970),<cross_reference>315 F. Supp. 152</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>168</cross_reference>, that court set forth the following<page_number>Page 613</page_number>
standard which we adopt with respect to items of property seized but not particularly described in the warrant, to wit:

"`. . . An officer may seize any property which is evidence of a crime, whether or not different from the crime by which the search was prompted, if: (1) the evidence is discovered in the course of a lawful search, whether initiated by a valid search warrant, a valid arrest warrant, circumstances justifying a lawful warrantless search, or circumstances justifying a lawful warrantless arrest, (2) the evidence in itself or in itself with facts known to the officer prior to the search, but without the necessity of subsequent development of additional facts, provides a connection between the evidence and criminal activity, (3) the evidence is discovered in the physical area properly searchable within the purposes for which the search was initiated, and (4) the evidence is discovered while the officer is actually searching for objects within the purpose for which the search was initiated.'"

No questions are raised as to the first, third and fourth requirements considering the purpose of the search in this case.  The hair samples fall within the second category in that these could conceivably be used for identification. The sweepings and door handle could fall within the description given in that the search included a search for any bloodstains.  The remaining items, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the comb, hair brush, eyeglass lens and small bunny could not in any event constitute evidence of probative value in this case.  They were merely inventoried surplus items. Therefore, the trial court was not required to grant the motion to suppress.

We conclude that the defendant's contentions regarding the seizure of the evidence in question are without merit.
