<posture>  APPEAL from a judgment of the circuit court for Dane county:  WILLIAM C. SACHTJEN, Circuit Judge.  <italic>Reversed</italic>.

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Proceeding by petitioner city of West Bend for an order of the Public Service Commission (hereinafter "PSC"), requiring the Chicago  North Western Railway Company (hereinafter "appellant") to move automatic electric crossing signals at its own expense.

<opinion_text>  The disposition of this case involves the consideration of two statutes:  Sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1) and (2),<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 277</page_number>
and sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>  The initial issue is whether sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1) is applicable, and this depends upon the meaning of the word "alteration" as used in the statutes.<page_number>Page 278</page_number>

The facts of this case are undisputed.  The appellant's railroad tracks cross Decorah road within the city limits of West Bend.  The city decided to widen Decorah road in the area of the crossing from 19.5 feet to 40 feet.

Except for a length of road a few hundred feet on either side of the railroad crossing, Decorah road had been widened to 40 feet previously.

The railroad crossing is protected by two electric warning devices which are outside the traveled portion of the old road, but inside the traveled portion of the widened road.  Nobody disputes the fact that these signals give an adequate warning to protect the public.  Neither does anyone take issue with the fact that the signals must be moved.  The sole problem involved in this case is who has to pay for the moving of the signals.

In November, 1965, the city notified the appellant that Decorah road was to be widened and that the railroad crossing and the warning signals would be affected.  The appellant initially estimated the cost of moving the signals at $915 and requested that the city submit a purchase order for that amount.  The appellant also offered<page_number>Page 279</page_number>
to provide whatever planking was necessary to widen the crossing if the city supplied the blacktop paving.

On September 14, 1966, the city filed a petition with the PSC for an order requiring the railway to move the crossing signals at its own expense.

On September 29, 1966, the PSC issued notice that it would investigate the matter pursuant to sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference>, Stats. (the pertinent provisions of that section will be discussed later in the opinion).  Testimony was taken on October 12, 1966, and on February 1, 1967.  The PSC found that during an average twenty-four-hour period about 4,000 vehicles presently used Decorah road.  Over the same period, eight trains used the crossing.  There had been no accidents at the crossing since the automatic signals were installed in 1951.  The Decorah road right-of-way is 80 feet wide.  The proposed widening of Decorah road and approaches to the railroad tracks will result in making the present warning signals an obstruction to the flow of vehicular traffic.  The railroad company estimated the cost of moving the signals at $1,140.

The appellant contends that the PsC erred as a matter of law in refusing to act under sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1) and (2), Stats.

Appellant further contends that if this case is properly brought under sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>, Stats., the PSC erred in concluding that the entire cost of moving the signals should be paid by the railroad.

Finally the appellant contends that certain procedural errors necessitate a reversal of the PSC's order.

<center>                 <italic>Applicability of Sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1), Stats.</italic></center>
It should be noted in the first instance that the petition of the city of West Bend did not specify under which section of the statutes relief was being sought.  When the PSC issued its notice of hearing, the notice specified that the city had requested relief under sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference>, Stats. This factor is particularly interesting because this court<page_number>Page 280</page_number>
has previously entertained the identical question involved here in a 1956 case between these same two parties.<italic>Chicago  N.W. Ry. v. Public Service Comm.</italic> (1956),<cross_reference>273 Wis. 654</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>79 N.W.2d 110</cross_reference>.  At that time the court did not determine the issue because the case was disposed on a jurisdictional question.

The PSC contends that it has no jurisdiction under sec.<cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1), Stats., until the public safety requires (1) an "alteration" in the Decorah road crossing; (2) the "relocation" of the highway; or (3) the establishment of a "new crossing."  Of these three categories the only possibility under the facts of this case would be an "alteration." However, the PSC construed "alteration" as a substantial change in either the grade or the alignment (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the angle at which the railroad tracks meet the street) of the crossing.

The position taken by the PSC appears to be opposed to that taken in 1956.

"Upon the railroad's petition, sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1), Stats., commands the commission to hold a hearing.  The commission did so and came to the conclusion that sec.<cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference> gave it no jurisdiction in the premises.  It based its decision upon its interpretation of the statute that its jurisdiction to apportion costs, as permitted by sec.<cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(2), is limited by sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1) to situations where a new crossing is established, an existing one is relocated, or an existing one is altered.  It submits that obviously no new or relocated crossing is involved here and the changes made by the city were too slight to constitute an `alteration' within the legislative meaning but are merely matters of street improvement in which the commission cannot and should not participate; <italic>the</italic><italic>commission, however, does not renounce jurisdiction to</italic><italic>participate by appropriate orders in cases where the</italic><italic>widening of a crossing effects so great a change that it</italic><italic>may properly be deemed an alteration</italic>.  It merely says that this improvement was too slight in its results to be so designated. . . ."  <italic>Chicago  N.W. Ry. v. Public</italic><italic>Service Comm., supra</italic>, at page 657.  (Emphasis supplied.)<page_number>Page 281</page_number>

The briefs filed in the case cited above disclose that the traveled portion of the road involved there was widened from 20 feet to 32 feet.

The gist of the PSC's argument in this case is that "alteration" has no fixed and definite meaning, that the interpretation which the PSC has applied to "alteration" is a reasonable one, that the PSC has consistently interpreted the word in the same way, and that the court should defer to the interpretation used by the commission when it is reasonable.

There can be no doubt that <italic>when a statute is considered</italic><italic>to be ambiguous</italic>, the interpretation rendered by an administrative agency is entitled to great weight.

". . . If we were presently disposed to consider the proper construction of the statute doubtful, this practical construction of the statute long followed by the <italic>Railroad</italic><italic>Commission</italic> with the apparent acquiescence of the legislature as well as those affected thereby, would be entitled to great weight. . . ."  <italic>Marinette, T.

Railroad Comm.</italic> (1928), <cross_reference>195 Wis. 462</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>465</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>218 N.W. 724</cross_reference>.  <italic>See also, Chevrolet Division, G.

(1969), <cross_reference>41 Wis.2d 261</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>163 N.W.2d 625</cross_reference>.

It is also true, however, that

". . . administrative interpretation is only of significance where there is an ambiguity in the statute.  It cannot overcome the plain wording of a statute where there is no ambiguity.  <italic>Nelson v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co.</italic>
(1966), <cross_reference>29 Wis.2d 315</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>320</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>139 N.W.2d 33</cross_reference>.

The PSC also argues that the railroad has acquiesced in its interpretation of secs. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>, Stats., over a long period of time.  That argument should be considered in light of the fact that this particular railroad company has brought the identical question involved in this case to this court on two separate occasions.  A more unbiased summary of the rulings acquiesced in by this appellant would undoubtedly conclude that the appellant<page_number>Page 282</page_number>
has conceded that sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference> applies when electric warning signals are initially installed at a railroad crossing.  <italic>See</italic> 24 PSCW 53 and 24 PSCW 504 from which orders no appeal was taken.

We cannot agree that the PSC's interpretation of "alteration" is reasonable insofar as the commission contends that an "alteration" only occurs when either the grade or the alignment of the crossing is changed.  Insofar as the commission contends that an "alteration" must be a substantial change (which was the commission's position in 1956), the interpretation could be upheld as reasonable.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>  However, when the traveled portion of a roadway is widened over 100 percent, the crossing has certainly been substantially altered as a matter of law.

The PSC insists that if "alteration" is equated with "change," every repair or repaving in the vicinity of a railroad crossing would result in a hearing before the commission.  That argument completely disregards the obligations imposed on the railroad under secs. <cross_reference>86.12</cross_reference>,<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 283</page_number>
and <cross_reference>86.13</cross_reference>(1),<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> Stats.  These sections require railroad companies to repave and repair the area between their tracks and the area within four feet of their tracks at a crossing.  The necessary work is to be done at the expense the railroad company.  These special statutes would seem to insure that the PSC will not be flooded with petty claims.  It should be noted that the warning signals involved in this case were beyond four feet from the edge the tracks.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

It follows then that the PSC should have followed the procedure set out in sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>, Stats., for this case. Sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference> is clearly limited to those situations where existing warning devices are inadequate to provide a proper warning.  The language of sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference> is not broad enough to empower the PSC to order the, moving of warning signals which admittedly provide an adequate warning.<page_number>Page 284</page_number>

We think it is quite clear that sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>, Stats., is applicable to this case.  Therefore it is unnecessary to determine whether the apportionment of damages under sec. <cross_reference>195.28</cross_reference> was improper.  Likewise, appellant's allegations of procedural error now become moot.  The matter must be remanded with directions to the circuit court to further remand the case to the PSC to order the movement of the signals pursuant to sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(1), and to apportion the expenses pursuant to sec. <cross_reference>195.29</cross_reference>(2).
