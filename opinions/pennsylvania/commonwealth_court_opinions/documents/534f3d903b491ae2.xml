<opinion_byline>  OPINION BY PRESIDENT JUDGE CRUMLISH, JR., November 18, 1982:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The Montgomery County Common Pleas Court ordered the forfeiture of a 1978 Porsche Coupe. We affirm.<page_number>Page 82</page_number>

Steven Setzman, President of Total Data Services, Inc., the titleholder of the Porsche, was arrested and charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance in violation of The Controlled Substance Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, <italic>as amended,</italic> <cross_reference>35 P. S. § 780-101</cross_reference>. Setzman, while sitting in the Porsche, sold $2,300 worth of cocaine to undercover agents and the car was seized under the provisions of Section 780-128 of the Act, <cross_reference>35 P. S. § 780-128</cross_reference>
(b). The Commonwealth subsequently petitioned for, the forfeiture of the Porsche under Section 780-128(a)(4).

We affirm on the basis of the able opinion of Judge SMILLIE, with one modification, ___ Pa. D.  C.3rd ___ (1981). We conclude that the certified transcript of Setzman's Gagnon II hearing, wherein he admitted that the substance in his possession was cocaine, was admissible under the provisions of 42 Pa. C. S. § 6106.

The Commonwealth's burden in a forfeiture proceeding is proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <italic>Commonwealth v. Myers,</italic>
___ Pa. Superior Ct. ___, ___ n. 5, <cross_reference>444 A.2d 1170</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1175</cross_reference> n. 5 (1982). The Commonwealth has met that burden.

Affirmed.
