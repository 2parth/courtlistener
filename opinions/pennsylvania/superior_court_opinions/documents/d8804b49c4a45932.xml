</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Ronald A. Phillips, a fifteen year old youth, sustained personal injuries when the Honda XR-80 trail bike which he had been driving collided with a truck on a public road in the Borough of Centerville, Washington County. An action to recover benefits under the Pennsylvania No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> was commenced against Nationwide Insurance Company, which had issued a policy of automobile insurance to Phillips' parents.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The trial court sustained preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer<page_number>Page 353</page_number>
and dismissed the complaint. Phillips appealed. We reverse.

In concluding that appellants had failed to state a cause of action, the trial court determined that the trail bike, which Phillips had been operating, was not a motor vehicle within the meaning of the No-fault Act. With this we agree. See:<italic>Siefert v. Nationwide Insurance,</italic> <cross_reference>289 Pa. Super. 160</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>432 A.2d 1101</cross_reference> (1981). See also: <italic>Bills v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance</italic><italic>Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>317 Pa. Super. 188</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>463 A.2d 1148</cross_reference> (1983) (dune buggy). Having concluded that the trail bike was not a motor vehicle, the trial court reasoned that Phillips had not suffered injury "arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle."<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>
With this we disagree. What the trial court overlooked was that Phillips' trail bike had been involved in a collision with a truck. The truck was a motor vehicle. Therefore, Phillips' injuries did arise from the use of a motor vehicle, i.e., the truck.

To the extent that a contrary result receives support from the decision of a panel of this court in <italic>Bindernagel v.</italic><italic>Nationwide Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>335 Pa. Super. 419</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>484 A.2d 773</cross_reference> (1984), that decision is overruled. We follow, rather, the decision of the court en banc filed of even date herewith in <italic>Pistorius v. Travelers Insurance Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>348 Pa. Super. 527</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>502 A.2d 670</cross_reference> (1985).

In <italic>Pistorius,</italic> the operator of a trail bike died as a result of injuries received when his bike came into collision with a licensed motor vehicle. We held that his administratrix was entitled to recover no-fault benefits. The trail bike which the decedent had been riding was a recreational vehicle, not subject to licensing under the Motor Vehicle Code. Therefore, it was not a motor vehicle. In turn, it could not be a motorcycle. Because the rider had been injured in a collision involving his recreational vehicle and a licensed motor vehicle, the applicable insurance carrier was liable for no-fault<page_number>Page 354</page_number>
benefits. The decision in <italic>Pistorius</italic> is controlling of the instant appeal.

Reversed and remanded. Jurisdiction is not retained.

CIRILLO, J., files a dissenting opinion in which OLSZEWSKI and TAMILIA, JJ., join.

</opinion_text><dissent_byline>  CIRILLO, Judge, dissenting:

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>  For the reasons set forth in my dissent in <italic>Pistorius v.</italic><italic>Travelers Insurance Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>348 Pa. Super. 527</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>502 A.2d 670</cross_reference>
(1985), filed even date herewith, I respectfully disagree that the injury arose out of the "maintenance or use of a motor vehicle." I would affirm the order of the trial court.

OLSZEWSKI and TAMILIA, JJ., join this dissenting opinion.
