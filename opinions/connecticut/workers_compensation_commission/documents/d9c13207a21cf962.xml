</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    The respondents have petitioned for review from the December 29, 1995 Finding and Order of the Commissioner acting for the Seventh District. In that order, the trial commissioner authorized the claimant to treat with Dr. John L. Tortora. In support of their petition for review, the respondents contend that the trial commissioner improperly authorized medical treatment from a physician who was not included as an approved physician under the managed care plan established by the employer pursuant to ยง <cross_reference>31-279</cross_reference>.

The trier's approval of an authorized physician was predicated on the basis of an informal hearing. Thus, no record exists as to the underlying proceeding. Moreover, the trial commissioner did not issue findings of fact. Without a transcript or findings of fact, we are unable to engage in meaningful review and cannot properly consider this appeal in accordance with ยง<cross_reference>31-301</cross_reference> C.G.S. See <underline>Warchola v. U.S. Gypsum Specialists,</underline><cross_reference>11 Conn. Workers' Comp. Rev. Op. 108</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1444 CRB 1-92-6</cross_reference> (1993); <underline>Nevers v.</underline><underline>Environmental Waste Removal,</underline> <cross_reference>10 Conn. Workers' Comp. Rev. Op. 96</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>1166 CRD-5-91-1</cross_reference> (1992); <underline>Kempesta v. Hendels Gas and Oil Co.,</underline><cross_reference>9 Conn. Workers' Comp. Rev. Op. 152</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>998 CRD-2-90-4</cross_reference> (1991).

Therefore, the appeal is remanded for a formal hearing and decision by the trial commissioner.

Commissioners George Waldron and Robin L. Wilson concur.
