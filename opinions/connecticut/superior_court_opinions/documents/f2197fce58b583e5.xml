</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  After trial on the March 15, 2007 amended petition, the court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law. The petitioner was originally arrested on charges that he had participated in a vicious and brutal robbery of two Yale students on Willow Street in New Haven. His attorney, Assistant Public Defender Joseph Lopez, first succeeded in negotiating an agreement to cooperate with the state so that the petitioner would not be charged by the federal government in a high profile rape case involving a victim from the University of New Haven. Lopez obtained all relevant discovery in the robbery case. Although a police officer had stopped the petitioner near the scene of the crime and then let him go, there was no need, contrary to the petitioner's claim, for Lopez to interview the police officer. The officer did not have a good description of the suspects from the victims and thus could not legally have held the petitioner longer, thus negating any mitigating inference from his decision to let the petitioner go. If anything, the officer's testimony was somewhat incriminating, as it placed the petitioner in the general vicinity of the crime. In addition to this evidence, the state had testimony from at least two accomplices and a tape recording of some inculpatory statements made by the petitioner to one of them. The petitioner faced a maximum exposure, based on the charges in the arrest warrant, of eighty-five years.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

In the second case, the petitioner was charged with larceny in the second degree arising from the theft of a car in Bridgeport, exposing the petitioner to an additional ten years in prison. The court credits the testimony of Lopez that the petitioner never told him of an alibi witness. In any case, the alibi witness in question resided on Grove Street in Meriden, where the police found the stolen car and, in a separate location on the same street, the car's front bumper. In addition, the witness was the petitioner's girlfriend at the time, who would have been subject to obvious impeachment for bias. Thus, the claimed alibi witness was of minimal exculpatory value. The petitioner's additional claim that he visited with his probation officer in New Haven CT Page 16889 that morning proved, in this trial, to be wholly unworthy of belief.

In the third case, the petitioner faced charges of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, second degree assault with a firearm, risk of injury to a minor, first degree reckless endangerment, first degree robbery, and second degree larceny. The petitioner's exposure in this case alone was fifty-one years. Lopez made all reasonable efforts to obtain photographs of the victim, but the state did not supply any. On the basis of the medical reports, the victim's testimony, and some prior misconduct evidence, Lopez reasonably concluded that the state had a strong case.

Lopez also knew that the state would seek to try the Willow Street robbery case first, thus exposing his client to a lengthy prison sentence based on the strong and highly sympathetic nature of the state's evidence. The petitioner had a prior felony record, making it difficult to put him on the stand. Lopez succeeded in obtaining an offer from the state of twelve years to serve for all three cases with concurrent time in a Milford violation of probation case. Lopez persisted and, as a result, obtained a revised offer of eleven years to serve with a more informal understanding that the petitioner would receive a concurrent sentence in Milford. Lopez discussed the benefits and costs of accepting the plea agreement with the petitioner and took the unusual step of putting his recommendation to accept the plea agreement in writing.

Based on this recital, it is apparent that there is no reasonable step that Lopez failed to take in his investigation of the case. See generally <italic>Strickland v. Washington</italic>, <cross_reference>466 U.S. 668</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>690-91</cross_reference> (1994). The petitioner has failed to show "what benefit additional investigation would have revealed." <italic>Holley v. Commissioner of Correction</italic>,<cross_reference>62 Conn.App. 170</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>175</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>774 A.2d 148</cross_reference> (2001). Further, it was well within the range of reasonable competence in this case for Lopez to advise the petitioner to plead guilty, even if investigation was not theoretically complete or some hypothetical defense existed. See <italic>State v. Lopez</italic>, <cross_reference>197 Conn. 337</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>343</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>497 A.2d 390</cross_reference> (1985); <italic>Bowers v. Commissioner of Correction</italic>,<cross_reference>33 Conn.App. 449</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>454-56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>636 A.2d 388</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>228 Conn. 929</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>640 A.2d 115</cross_reference> (1994). The petitioner faced a maximum possible incarceration of some 146 years, the state's cases were strong, and the first case to be tried was particularly unmitigating. Under these circumstances, Lopez did an excellent job, from the defense perspective, in obtaining an offer of eleven years to serve. There was no ineffective assistance of counsel.

For these reasons, the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus is CT Page 16890 denied. Judgment shall enter for the respondent. Petitioner shall submit a judgment file within thirty days of the date of this decision.

It is so ordered.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The arrest warrant charged the petitioner with two counts of first degree robbery, two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree robbery, two counts of second degree larceny, and two counts of conspiracy to commit larceny in the second degree. The court assumes that the petitioner could not have been separately punished for both robbery and larceny, or for conspiracy to commit both. The petitioner was later charged with tampering with a witness.</footnote_body>
