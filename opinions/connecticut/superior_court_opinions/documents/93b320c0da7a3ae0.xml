<opinion_text><unpublished>  <italic>MEMORANDUM OF DECISION</italic>

This is the defendant's amended motion for modification (#147) requesting that the judgment of dissolution of the parties' marriage be opened and modified.

The court dissolved the parties' marriage on September 4, 1998. A separation agreement between the parties was incorporated in the court's decree. Among other things, the agreement contains a section (Article 8.5) titled "Pensions, Stocks, 401(k) Plans, Retirement Accounts, Etc." which provides that: "One-half of the husband's defined benefit retirement plan accrued to the date of the dissolution of marriage of the parties shall be transferred to the wife by way of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). The Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction over said QDRO."

On the date of dissolution the plaintiff husband, Brian T. Dougherty, was employed by the State of Indiana and was a member of the Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund. At the time of dissolution, neither party knew that under the laws of the State of Indiana, the Indiana public Employees' Retirement Fund is not required to honor, and does not honor, Qualified Domestic Relations Orders (QDROs). Therefore, one-half of the plaintiff's defined benefit retirement plan has never been transferred to the defendant. This motion requests that the court open the judgment and modify it to give effect to the intention of the parties as expressed in the separation agreement.

"[I]t is a well-established general rule that even a judgment rendered by the court upon the consent of the parties, which is in the nature of a contract to which the court has given its approval, can subsequently be opened [after the four month limitation] . . . if it is shown that the stipulation, and hence the judgment, was obtained by fraud, in the actual absence of consent, or because of mutual mistake." <italic>Magowan v.</italic><italic>Magowan</italic>, <cross_reference>73 Conn.App. 733</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>741</cross_reference> (2002). The defendant initially relies on mutual mistake for opening the judgment and entering an order which will CT Page 1980 effectuate the intent of the parties. Clearly there was a mutual mistake of the parties that the retirement plan could be divided by QDRO. This provides sufficient grounds to open the judgment.

Unfortunately, the nature of the pension plan makes it is a bit more complicated than simply fashioning an order which will effectuate the intent of the parties on the date of the judgment. The evidence produced at the hearing on this motion revealed that on the day of judgment the plaintiff, as a member of the Indiana Public Employees' Retirement Fund, had a vested interest in a future retirement benefit consisting of 1) an annuity savings account, and 2) a monthly pension paid for life. The defendant claims that both parts of the future retirement benefit were to be divided. The plaintiff claims that only the pension portion, and not the savings account, were to be divided. Alternatively, the defendant argues that she was never aware that the plaintiff had an annuity savings account because the plaintiff fraudulently hid it from her or failed to disclose it based upon fraud or negligence.

The parties agree that the plaintiff's vested interest in the annuity savings account as of September 30, 1998 totaled $38,105.09. One-half of that interest totals $19,052.55. The parties also agree that the sum of $814 per month represents the pension benefit (exclusive of the annuity savings account) to be received by the plaintiff, calculated as of September 4, 1998, as based upon his five (5) highest year's average salary and his then number of years of service. One-half of that estimated monthly pension benefit totals $407 per month.

Both parties testified at the hearing on this motion. The plaintiff testified that the parties intended to divide the defined benefit pension only, and that he was to retain the annuity savings account. In support of his position he points to the language of Article 8.5 of the agreement ("one-half of the husband's defined benefit retirement plan") and to another article of the separation agreement which provides, in relevant part: "Subject to the provisions of this agreement, each party has remised, released and forever discharged . . . the other of and from all claims, rights or demands whatever, in law or in equity, including any interest in any pension, profit-sharing, deferred compensation or other qualified benefit plan . . ."

The defendant understood that she would get one-half of the plaintiff's pension plan but did not know what this consisted of. She did not even know that he had an annuity savings plan. As to the annuity savings plan, it is clear that there was no mutual mistake. The plaintiff knew that there was such a plan but thought that he was keeping it. The defendant did not even know it existed. CT Page 1981

The defendant next relies upon fraud. It is well established that a stipulated marital judgment may be opened if obtained by fraudulent nondisclosure. <italic>Jackson v. Jackson</italic>, <cross_reference>2 Conn.App. 179</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>194</cross_reference>, cert. den.<cross_reference>194 Conn. 805</cross_reference> (1984). Fraud by nondisclosure involves the failure to make a full and fair disclosure of known facts connected with a matter about which a party has assumed to speak, under circumstances in which there is a duty to speak. <italic>Gelinas v. Gelinas</italic>, <cross_reference>10 Conn.App. 446</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>449-50</cross_reference> (1987). The standard for proving any fraud claim is clear and convincing evidence. <italic>Alaimo v. Royer</italic>, <cross_reference>188 Conn. 36</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>39</cross_reference> (1982). Having heard the parties, I cannot find that the defendant has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff intended to mislead the plaintiff. The plaintiff was a candid and credible witness, and I believed his testimony that he did not intend to mislead the plaintiff.

It has also been held that the court may open a judgment of dissolution based upon negligent misrepresentation by nondisclosure even though there exists no improper motive or intent to deceive.<italic>Marineau v. LaRosa</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven at New Haven, Docket No. 89-0279189 (August 23, 2005), citing <italic>Pospisil v.</italic><italic>Pospisil</italic>, <cross_reference>59 Conn.App. 446</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>449-50</cross_reference> (2000), cert. denied, <cross_reference>254 Conn. 940</cross_reference>
(2000). The defendant argues that the plaintiff's financial affidavit of December 4, 1998 negligently misrepresented the nature of his deferred compensation leading the plaintiff not to understand the fact that the plaintiff had an annuity savings account which was distinct from the pension. The standard of proof for negligent misrepresentation merely requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <italic>Rego v. Connecticut</italic><italic>Insurance Placement Facility</italic>, <cross_reference>22 Conn.App. 428</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>430</cross_reference> (1990), reversed on other grounds, <cross_reference>219 Conn. 339</cross_reference> (1991); <italic>Calabro v. Calabro</italic>,<cross_reference>33 Conn.App. 842</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>846</cross_reference> (1994).

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's financial affidavits contained in the court file. The affidavit dated September 9, 1997 contains the following item listed under "Deferred Compensation": "Public Employee's Retirement Fund — (Available only through employment termination) — $30,000." The affidavit dated September 4, 1998 has two items listed under "Deferred Compensation" but still shows $30,000 as the single value. The first item is: "Public Employees Retirement Fund — (Available only through employment termination)." The second item is "Deferred Benefit Plan — (1.1 x # of years and highest 3 years)." I find that the overall effect of these affidavits is materially misleading as to the nature and value of the plaintiff's deferred compensation benefits. It is not at all clear that the first item is a savings plan with any value. It is not accurate that the value of the two items was $30,000. The amount in the annuity savings plan was $38,105.09; the vested right CT Page 1982 to receive $814 per month at retirement must have added substantial value as well. The plaintiff might reasonably have expected the defendant to rely upon the misleading nature of these affidavits and assume that she had agreed to receive one-half of the full value of all of the retirement benefits owned by the plaintiff. The defendant has proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the affidavits contain negligent misrepresentations by nondisclosure despite the fact there was no improper motive on the part of the plaintiff. For this reason, the court issues the following order which provide an alternate way of dividing the plaintiff's property interest in his deferred compensation including the annuity savings plan.

The Judgment shall be modified by substituting the following order in lieu of the provisions of Paragraph 8.5 of the Separation Agreement:

<block_quote>  Benefits to which the Husband, Brian T. Dougherty, is entitled as a member of the Public Employees' Retirement Fund of the State of Indiana, consisting of an annuity savings account and a monthly pension, are hereby assigned and transferred pursuant to Section <cross_reference>46b-81</cross_reference> of the General Statutes, and are to be distributed to the Defendant, Denise A.
