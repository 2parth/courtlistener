</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff Litchfield Feed and Grain, LLC brought this action against Glyndon Valley Health Products ("GVHP"), a distributor of pet food products, and Canidae Pet Foods, Inc. (Canidae), a manufacturer and distributor of pet food products. The owner and sole proprietor of the plaintiff Litchfield Feed and Grain, LLC is Mealora Windecker. "GVHP" was defaulted for failure to appear on May 30, 2006, and thus, as to it, the matter was tried as a hearing in damages on September 8, 2006. On the same date, the matter proceeded to trial against Canidae.

The plaintiff elected to pursue certain counts only of those asserted in the complaint of January 19, 2002. As to Canidae, the case was tried on the third count for breach of contract (based on the apparent agency of "GVHP" to contract on behalf of Canidae) and the fourth count for equitable estoppel. As to GVHP, the hearing in damages proceeded on the sixth count for breach of contract, the eighth count for fraud, and the ninth count for negligent misrepresentation.

The LLC was a pet supply business which sold food and grooming products from various distributors from its Litchfield, Connecticut, location. Windecker had seen an article in Whole Dog Journal (WDJ) listing Canidae as one of the "top ten" dry dog foods and she was interested in selling Canidae products as a means of diversifying the LLC's product line. She conducted an on-line investigation of Canidae's website and found no listing of any Connecticut distributor of Canidae pet foods. She then called the 800 number listed for Canidae by WDJ and was directed by a customer service representative to Arnie Scher for information regarding distributorships. Scher was President/CEO of GVHP. Exhibit 5. Windecker testified that, over three or font phone conversations with Scher, she made clear her interest in becoming a distributor of Canidae's dog and cat food products CT Page 17338 (respectively "Canidae" and "Felidae") and he answered her queries about the product. He sent her various documents in response, all of which bore the GVPH legend. One such communication was captioned "Glyndon Valley Health Products Would Like Your Help!!!!," included a price list for Canidae products, and included such statements as "Glyndon Valley is looking for wholesalers and distributors in your region . . ." and "We are offering great buy-in incentives . . . Exhibit 4. Pages 3 and 4 of Exhibit 4 was entitled "Glyndon Valley Health Products Distribution Guidelines" and called for execution by the interested party below a top line which read "Distributor Applicant Signature and Date." <italic>Id.,</italic> p. 4. Windecker signed and dated the document on March 19, 1999, and returned it to Scher believing she was contracting with both defendants to be the sole Connecticut distributor of Canidae pet foods. Noteworthy, however, is that this document: 1) called for approval of a "Glyndon Valley Officer" — left incomplete; 2) made no reference to Canidae or its pet food products; 3) specifically provided the signing company would "represent Glyndon Valley Health Products," that "Territories assigned to you will initially be based on client base demographics and sales in those regions you are requesting exclusivity in. The marketing plan will play a major role in this decision.," and that "Companies must provide a marketing plan for a twelve month period, (sic) prior to approval by GVHP."<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> <italic>Id.</italic> Exhibit 4 contained no revenue or product goals, no term identifying the duration of the arrangement, and no requirements for product orders. A price list of Canidae products (wholesale and retail) was attached (<italic>Id.,</italic>
p. 5). Once she executed and returned what she believed was a contract binding both defendants, Scher wrote to thank her for "coming on line with Glyndon Valley Health Products" and expressing his hope their relationship would be "very successful . . . for many years to come" and that they would experience "continued growth." Exhibit 5. All invoices for products she ordered came directly from GVHP in Maryland (Exhibit 6) and all consignee memos regarding product shipment showed shipment from GVHP in Maryland. Exhibit 7. No consignee memos specifically identified the product shipped as Canidae food products though it is clear it was. Windecker testified Scher told her she was to have the exclusive distributorship in Connecticut. Though she stated she had some telephone conversations with John Gordon of Canidae during which she told him she had an exclusive distributorship in this state, she did not testify Gordon made any affirmative response; in fact, she never testified to <italic>any</italic>
response from Gordon regarding her belief. The basis of her CT Page 17339 belief she had a legally binding contract with Canidae consists of the two-page document above described (Exhibit 4, pp. 3, 4) and "regular conversations" with Gordon between March 19, 1999, (when she executed the "contract"), and August 20, 1999 (when she terminated her sale of Canidae pet foods), during which conversations Gordon failed to contradict her claim of an exclusive distributorship. While she also testified to travel from Connecticut to Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1999 to attend a trade show and to meet Scher (which she did) and was told by Scher that Gordon was also in attendance, she never met or spoke to him while there.

On or about August 20, 1999, Windecker discovered another pet food distributor (O.K. Pet) had Canidae pet product in house and was distributing it in this state for less than the price at which it was suggested she sell it. When, on August 24, 1999, she inquired of Gordon why her "exclusive distributorship" was cancelled, Gordon's reply was, "We don't have an agreement with you. You might have an agreement with Arnie but that's between the two of you." A gentlemen from Canidae, identified only as "Scott," also confirmed by telephone O.K. Pet's distribution of Canidae product in Connecticut. Windecker's store continued to operate until October 8, 2004. She claims damages from March 19, 1999, to August 20, 1999.

<center>                  <italic>Third and Fourth Counts as to Canidae</italic></center>
Count three asserts GVHP had the "apparent authority to make and enter into contracts and transactions on behalf of Canidae Pet . . ." because: 1) GVHP possessed materials of Canidae Pet; 2) Canidae Pet referred the plaintiff to GVHP after the plaintiff's phone inquiry regarding Canidae product; and 3) GVHP was the only pet food distributor present at the annual meeting of Canidae distributors. Paragraph 14. The plaintiff further asserted Canidae had clothed GVHP with indicia of agency to include GVHP's authorization to take orders for Canidae product (Paragraph 17, 18) and that, relying upon such apparent authority, she entered into the contract (Exhibit 4, pp. 3 and 4). Paragraph 18.

"The issue of apparent authority is one of fact, requiring the trier of fact to evaluate the conduct of the parties in light of all the surrounding circumstances . . ." <italic>Edart Truck Rental</italic><italic>Corporation v. B. Swirsky  Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>23 Conn.App. 137</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>140</cross_reference> (1990). It is that semblance of authority which a principal, through his CT Page 17340 own acts or inadvertencies, causes or allows third persons to believe his agent possesses. <italic>Beckenstein v. Potter  Carrier,</italic><italic>Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>191 Conn. 120</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>140</cross_reference> (1983) (citing Restatement [Second], 1 Agency § 8). It must be determined by the acts of the principal rather than by the acts of the agent. <italic>Id.</italic> "Furthermore, a party seeking to impose liability upon the principal must demonstrate that it acted in good faith based upon the actions or inadvertence of the principal." <italic>Id.</italic> Our Appellate Court, in<italic>111 Whitney Avenue, Inc. v. Commissioner of Mental Retardation,</italic><cross_reference>70 Conn.App. 692</cross_reference> (2002), a case upon which the plaintiff relies, is on point but not helpful to the plaintiff. In affirming the trial court's entry of judgment for the defendant on theories of contract, actual authority, and apparent authority, the Court noted apparent authority has two elements: 1) It must appear from the acts of the principal that the principal held the agent out as possessing sufficient authority to embrace <italic>the act in</italic><italic>question</italic> (Emphasis added.) or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority; and 2) The party seeking to bind the principal must have acted in good faith reliance on that appearance of authority. <italic>Id.,</italic> at 704-05.

It needs first be stated that the Third Count asserts a breach of contract claim premised upon the apparent authority of GVHP to bind Canidae by virtue of pp. 3 and 4 of Exhibit 4. The court cannot ignore what the plaintiff fails to address — namely, whether the document executed only by Windecker constitutes a legally binding contract. The court is persuaded it does not. The document is entitled "Glyndon Valley Health Product Distribution Guidelines" and it is not executed by anybody from GVHP. The document fails to recite any of the essential terms of an enforceable agreement. <italic>Id.</italic> at 699. While there is no bright line rule describing the essential elements of any or all enforceable agreements, what is an "essential" term turns on the particular facts of the case. Since what the plaintiff here sought was an exclusive distributorship permitting her to market and sell Canidae pet foods in the State of Connecticut, agreement on that issue was clearly "essential"; yet nowhere in the claimed "contract" is that promised by GVHP nor is the word "exclusive" to be found therein. In fact, nowhere is the named plaintiff — Litchfield Feed and Grain, LLC — named. The duration of the agreement is not expressed. There is not stated therein any obligation on the part of the plaintiff except in the most generalized fashion — i.e., she was to develop a marketing plan "prior to approval by GVHP," demonstrate responsible and steady growth over a period of time "with regard to marketing goals and CT Page 17341 sales," etc. (Exhibit 4, page 3). Those conditions are so indefinite as to assure future conflicts. The plaintiff had in fact not established a marketing plan and, though she testified with regard to her efforts to promote the product, she offered no evidence of the growth in sales of Canidae product or of distribution of the pet food products to other Connecticut suppliers during the period for which she seeks damages. The claimed document was no more than a solicitation that the plaintiff come on board as <italic>a</italic> distributor of the product(s) and generally expressed GVHP's expectations should she do so. Nor can it, be said, assuming arguendo the court found an enforceable contract, that this defendant was in breach in view of Windecker's testimony it was she who voluntarily terminated the relationship.

Finally, had the court found the document was a legally binding contract, the court does not conclude GVHP's conduct in possessing materials such as Canidae's product price list,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> a Canidae customer service representative's referral of the plaintiff to GVHP when she initially inquired about a distributorship, and/or GVHP being the only distributor present at the "annual meeting of distributors"<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> for Canidae are sufficient to conclude GVHP had apparent authority to bind Canidae to a contract. Given all of the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff's reliance upon her belief GVHP had apparent authority to contract on behalf of Canidae so as to confer upon the plaintiff the benefits of an exclusive distributorship of Canidae pet foods was unreasonable. The burden of proof was not met as to the Third Count.

The Fourth Count asserts Canidae ought be equitably estopped from denying its liability to the plaintiff for reason of reliance on "representations" by Canidae. Paragraph 15. The only "representation" was Canidae's customer service representative's phone referral of Windecker to GVHP on Windecker's call to the 800 number listed for Canidae in the rating of dry dog foods by Whole Dog Journal. Paragraph 14. The plaintiff claims that referral induced her belief GVHP had the authority to bind Canidae to contract for an exclusive distributorship<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> and caused her to take certain actions which caused her damages.

Equitable estoppel is predicated on proof of two essential elements: 1) The party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief: CT Page 17342 and 2) The other party must change its position in relying on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. <italic>O'Sullivan v.</italic><italic>Bergenty,</italic> <cross_reference>214 Conn. 641</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>648</cross_reference> (1990). Additionally, it is the burden of the party claiming the estoppel to show that he exercised due diligence to ascertain the truth and that that party not only lacked knowledge of the true state of things but had no convenient means of acquiring that knowledge.<italic>Spear-Newman, Inc. v. Modern Floors Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>149 Conn. 88</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>91-92</cross_reference>
(1961). The party claiming estoppel has the burden of proof; whether it has met that burden in a particular case is an issue of fact. <italic>McManus v. Roggi,</italic> <cross_reference>78 Conn.App. 288</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>302</cross_reference> (2003), citing to <italic>Ridgefield v. Eppoliti Realty Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>71 Conn.App. 321</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>337</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>261 Conn. 933</cross_reference> (2002).

The court cannot conclude the plaintiff has established her burden of proof on the Fourth Count. Reliance upon a Canidae customer service representative's single telephone referral to GVHP together with some follow-up telephone conversations with Gordon (of Canidae) are insufficient in view of Gordon's failure to make any commitment with regard to either an exclusive distributorship or Scher's authority to bind Canidae to contract (assuming arguendo the existence of a contract). The plaintiff relied on a document (Exhibit 4) which made no reference to an exclusive distributorship and included no provision that she have an exclusive territory. More specifically, the document upon which she relied provided, "Any existing subdistributorships or wholesalers will be assigned to you after a trial period of 180 days intended to measure performance and success of your organization." <italic>Id.,</italic> page 4. A careful reading of that document should have put Windecker on notice she did not have the exclusivity she sought. It is entirely relevant that the plaintiff voluntarily terminated her sale of Canidae pet products prior to the expiration of the 180-day "trial" period referenced in Exhibit 4. Under these circumstances, any reliance by Windecker was not reasonable.

Judgment hereby enters for Canidae on the third and fourth counts

<center>               <italic>Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Counts as to GVHP</italic></center>
The plaintiff cannot prevail on the Sixth Count claiming a breach of contract, the court having found Exhibit 4, pp. 3, 4 does not constitute a legally binding contract. CT Page 17343 The Eighth Count pleads a cause of action for promissory estoppel. "A fundamental element of promissory estoppel is the existence of a clear and definite promise which a promiser could reasonably have expected to induce reliance. Thus, a promiser is not liable to a promisee who has relied on a promise if, judged by an objective standard, he had no reason to expect any reliance at all." <italic>Stewart v. Cendant Mobility Services Corp.,</italic><cross_reference>267 Conn. 96</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104-05</cross_reference> (2003). (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 90. The promise need not be the equivalent of an offer to enter into a contract because "[T]he prerequisite for . . . application [of the doctrine of promissory estoppel] is a <italic>promise</italic> and not a bargain and <italic>not</italic> an <italic>offer. Stewart, supra,</italic> at 105, citing to 3 A. <italic>Corbin,</italic> Contracts (Rev. Ed. 1996) § 8.9, p. 29 (Emphasis in original). Additionally, the promise must reflect a present intent to commit as distinguished from a mere statement of intent to contract in the future. See <italic>D'Ulisse-Cupo v. Board of</italic><italic>Directors of Notre Dame High School,</italic> <cross_reference>202 Conn. 206</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>214-15</cross_reference>. The requirements of clarity and definiteness are the determinative factors in deciding whether the statements are indeed expressions of commitment as opposed to expressions of intention, hope, desire, or opinion. <italic>Id.</italic> Whether a given representation rises to that level is a question of fact to be determined in light of the circumstances under which the representation was made. <italic>Torosyan</italic><italic>v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>234 Conn. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>17</cross_reference>
n. 6 (1995).

The court finds there is not sufficient evidence GVHP's representations (through Scher, its President/CEO) to Windecker to invoke a cause of action for promissory estoppel because neither sufficiently promissory nor sufficiently definite to support contractual liability. As in <italic>D'Ulisse, supra,</italic> the plaintiff relied upon a written document she contended was a contract. The plaintiff there alleged authorized representatives of the Notre Dame High School board had made certain representations to her that suggested to her she would be offered a new contract and that she relied on those representations to her detriment. Our Supreme Court concluded none of the representations contained any of the material terms essential to an employment contract and that the board's statements concerning the expectation of a future contract stopped short of a definite promise upon which she could reasonably have relied. In the instant case, although Windecker testified to Scher having told her she had an "exclusive" distributorship of Canidae pet products for the entirety of this state, she has incorporated all CT Page 17344 of the allegations of the First Count (asserted against Canidae based upon the actual authority of Scher to bind GVHP and Canidae) premised upon breach of the terms of pp. 3 and 4 of Exhibit 4. Thus, the court does not consider whether Scher's oral statements to her are sufficient to permit recovery since the alleged promise must be considered in the context of the claimed "contract." As already determined, Exhibit 4 promises no exclusivity and, unlike <italic>D'Ulisse-Cupo</italic> in which the plaintiff's school principal had posted a written notice on a school bulletin board stating, "All present faculty members will be offered contracts for next year." (<cross_reference>202 Conn., at 208</cross_reference>), Exhibit 4 makes no affirmative representation of exclusivity. Nor does Exhibit 5 (another letter from Scher). It therefore follows that any oral representation of an exclusive distributorship could not have induced her reliance in the face of a written document which did not confirm that understanding — particularly when she never requested written corroboration. At best, the document promises merely a distributorship — which she received only to later relinquish.

The cause of action asserted in the Ninth Count is fraud based upon the claimed negligent misrepresentation she was getting an exclusive distributorship. Fraud involves deception practiced to induce another to act to her detriment. <italic>Chase Manhattan Mortgage</italic><italic>Corporation v. Machado,</italic> <cross_reference>83 Conn.App. 183</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>188</cross_reference> (2004). "The four essential elements of fraud are that: 1) a false misrepresentation of fact was made; 2) the party making the misrepresentation knew it to be false; 3) the representation was made to induce action by the other party; and 4) the other party did so act to her detriment." <italic>Id.</italic> (Citation omitted.) The governing principles [of negligent misrepresentation] are set forth . . . in § 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977): "One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment . . . supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information."<italic>Williams Ford, Inc. v. Hartford Courant Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>232 Conn. 559</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>575</cross_reference>
(1995). (Quotations omitted.) Although no special relationship is required to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation, "The plaintiff must allege and prove that the reliance on the misstatement was justified or reasonable." <italic>Id.</italic> at 580. In general, reliance upon non-disclosure of facts is not sufficient.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> See e.g., <italic>Egan v. Hudson Nut Products,</italic><italic>CT Page 17345</italic><italic>Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>142 Conn. 344</cross_reference> (1955). There, the defendant had sold the plaintiffs a house and lot which violated the town's building code. The Court held that, in the absence of questions to the defendant regarding its duty to inform of such violations, the defendant could not be liable for failure to mention the same and non-disclosure did not give to the plaintiffs a right to recover damages. <italic>Id.,</italic> at 348. In the words of another Court, there is not the duty to disclose when "All facts . . . are open to discovery upon reasonable inquiry . . ." <italic>Gagne v. Smith,</italic><cross_reference>104 Conn. 650</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>652</cross_reference> (1926). In the case before the court, Windecker has pleaded justifiable reliance. Ninth Count, ¶¶ 14-17. For all of the reasons herein described, the court is not persuaded the plaintiff's reliance was reasonable or justified and, thus, this count also fails.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

Judgment enters for GVHP on the Sixth, Eight, and Ninth Counts.

</unpublished></opinion_text><unpublished><footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Windecker testified Scher discouraged her formulating a marketing plan, preferring instead that she focus on "growing the business" by expanding her contacts to expose consumers to Canidae products.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Because there was no evidence GVHP distributed only Canidae pet foods (A photograph suggests otherwise.), it is reasonable to conclude GVHP had the price lists of other manufacturers and/or of dog and cat dry foods.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> There was <italic>no</italic> evidence with regard to an "annual meeting" of Canadie distributors. If the reference is to the Atlantic City trade show which both Scher and Gordon attended, there was no evidence offered to permit a finding no other Connecticut distributor of Canidae attended.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> The plaintiff's trial testimony concerned an exclusive "distributorship" she believed she had. The complaint makes frequent reference to a "subdistributorship." Because the plaintiff fails to distinguish between the two, the court treats the terms as interchangeable for the purpose of adjudication.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> Thus, Windecker's testimony neither Scher nor Gordon ever told he she did <italic>not</italic> have an exclusive distributorship cannot alone be the basis of liability on this count.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn6]</footnote_number> That GVHP was defaulted for failure to appear does not relieve the plaintiff of her burden of establishing the elements CT Page 17346 of causes of action she has asserted. If that were so, the court could proceed to hearing only evidence of damages in every hearing in damages.</footnote_body>
