<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff has brought this action against the defendants for breach of lease agreement (Count One); destruction of rental property (Count Two); reckless destruction of rental property (Count Three); and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) (Count Four). The litigation concerns a lease agreement in which the defendants rented a house in Middletown from the plaintiff. Although the defendants were tenants under the plaintiff's lease, they were also landlords for the residential tenants to whom they sublet portions of the premises. This dispute involves the defendants' alleged failure to order oil to heat the property and their permitting a tenant to use an old fireplace with a chimney which had not been properly serviced and was not safe for fires. Because the defendants allegedly failed to order oil, the plaintiff contends that the pipes burst and the boiler needed to be replaced. The plaintiff also needed to repair the chimney because of damage caused by fires in the fireplace.

The defendants now move to strike Count Four, in which the plaintiffs make a claim against them under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>42-110a</cross_reference>, et. seq. The fundamental argument is that although CUTPA may be applied to landlord-tenant situations, it has never been permitted in an action by a landlord against a tenant. See, e.g., <italic>D'Albero v.</italic><italic>Vailette,</italic> <cross_reference>8 Conn. L. Rptr. 69</cross_reference>, 1992 WL 389824 (Conn.Super.), in which a landlord under a commercial lease attempted to bring a CUTPA claim against his tenant for failure to comply with the lease and failure to repair alleged damages to the property. All of the allegations against the defendants in this case are in their capacity as tenants of the plaintiff and build on the claims in the first three counts that the defendants violated the terms of their lease and either negligently or recklessly destroyed portions of the rental property. CT Page 7960

The plaintiff argues that under the facts of this case, the actions of the defendants support a claim under CUTPA. They cite<italic>Holeva Trustee v. MZ Associates, Inc.,</italic> Docket No. CV97-098403, Judicial District of New Haven (November 9, 1998, Levin, J.) (<cross_reference>23 Conn. L. Rptr. 601</cross_reference>) for the proposition that a claim by a landlord against a tenant may support a CUTPA violation. In that case, the plaintiff landlord alleged that the tenant "retained possession and control of the premises" and "failed, neglected and refused to use or occupy the premises." The plaintiff further contended that despite their lack of intention to occupy the premises, they "retained possession and control of the premises as a means of trying to coerce or induce the plaintiff to reduce or discount amounts owed by the defendant to the plaintiff . . . on repeated occasions, the defendant informed the plaintiff that it would not surrender possession and control of the demised premises to the plaintiff unless and until the plaintiff entered into a compromise as to the amounts due . . ." Judge Levin concluded that those allegations implicated CUTPA.

There are no such allegations, however, in the instant case. There is no claim that the defendant-tenants attempted to use the landlord-tenant relationship as part of an unfair trade practice. All that is alleged here is that the defendants rented the premises from the plaintiffs, that they failed to pay the rent due, and that they caused certain enumerated items of damage to the premises. If such allegations could turn an action by a landlord against a commercial tenant into a CUTPA claim, virtually all landlord-tenant actions against commercial tenants would become CUTPA cases.

With respect to Count Four, the plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted as a matter of law, and the motion to strike Count Four of the complaint is therefore granted.
