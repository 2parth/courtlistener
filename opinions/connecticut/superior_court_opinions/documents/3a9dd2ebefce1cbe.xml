Following a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff Mark Brown, he now seeks an award of attorneys fees and costs and an assessment of punitive damages. The parties agreed that if attorneys fees and punitive damages were issues, they would be determined by the court after the jury rendered its verdict.

After hearing two and one-half days of evidence the jury returned a verdict finding in favor of Brown and against the defendants Frank and Lisa Palumberi on claims of breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, statutory civil theft pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-564</cross_reference>, and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes §<cross_reference>42-110a</cross_reference> et seq. (CUTPA). The jury awarded total compensatory damages for all counts in the amount of $50,000, but trebled that amount on the statutory civil theft count to $150,000 pursuant to the dictates of that statute.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The defendants have filed no motions to set aside or otherwise contest the verdict. However, they have opposed the plaintiff's request for punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs.

The question facing the court is the proper means of melding together an appropriate remedy with respect to plaintiff's requests for punitive damages and attorneys fees when (1) the request for punitive damages finds its source in two common-law claims on which the jury found for the plaintiff, and in the statutory CUTPA claim on which the plaintiff also prevailed; (2) CUTPA allows for both punitive damages and attorneys fees, and (3) the plaintiff has also prevailed on a statutory claim which requires the award of treble compensatory damages.

This litigation arose out of the business of three refuse collection companies jointly owned by Brown and Frank Palumberi who had been friends since their school days in Darien. The joint business venture began in the late 1920s and by 2000 Brown and Frank Palumberi were 50-50 owners of the three business entities: New England Carting, Inc., New Canaan Carting, LLC and Town and Country Carting of Darien, LLC. For various reasons, the parties decided to split up in 2001 but were unable to agree on the proper division of assets and income. The major assets and sources of income in the refuse collection business are the collection routes. These routes are often purchased from other refuse collectors, and the division of the routes owned by the three jointly owned companies was the main stumbling block to the division of the assets in this case.

After the passage of several months, and with no agreement in the offing, the defendant Lisa Palumberi, Frank Palumberi's wife, established a fourth company, New England Carting of Wilton, LLC (Wilton Carting) of which she was the sole owner. Previously, Lisa Palumberi had worked as the bookkeeper for the three jointly owned companies. In early 2002 income from New England Carting and New Canaan Carting, and certain assets thereof, were directed by the defendants into the account of Wilton Carting. In March 2002 Lisa Palumberi sent a letter to Brown stating in essence that the split of assets would consist of allocating the Town and Country Carting, LLC route in Darien and one of the New Canaan Carting, LLC routes to Brown and one New Canaan route and the New England Carting route to Frank Palumberi and Wilton Carting. The letter also announced several unilateral steps taken by the defendants to put into effect the allocation of routes and customers. Brown subsequently brought this lawsuit claiming that the division of assets by, and the actions of Mr. and Mrs. Palumberi were unfair and improper.

The plaintiff seeks an award of attorneys fees in the amount of $308,251.50 and $32,712.00 in non-taxable costs. This request is based on two sources of authority. First, the jury found that the defendants Frank and Lisa Palumberi acted wilfully, wantonly or maliciously in breaching their fiduciary duties to Brown and in converting Brown's property, and plaintiff contends that he is entitled to common-law punitive damages which in Connecticut are comprised of the plaintiff's expenses of litigation, less taxable CT Page 10721 costs. See <italic>Berry v. Loiseau,</italic> <cross_reference>223 Conn. 786</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>811</cross_reference> (1992);<italic>Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc. v. Canaan Oil  Fuel Co.,</italic><cross_reference>193 Conn. 208</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>234-38</cross_reference> (1984). Second, as the prevailing party, Brown seeks reasonable attorneys fees (as well as punitive damages) pursuant to CUTPA, specifically General Statutes §<cross_reference>42-110g</cross_reference>(a)(d).

In support of his requests, Brown's counsel has submitted counsel's affidavit and a summary of attorney billing records and litigation costs. According to the affidavit, Brown incurred legal fees of $39,000 prior to retaining his present counsel and that amount is <italic>not</italic> included in the attorneys fee request. Also, not included in the request according to the affidavit, is approximately $19,000 of fees related to plaintiff's claims withdrawn before trial, claims for injunctive relief, work performed by attorneys who did not work regularly on the case, and time bringing one attorney up to speed when another attorney was out on maternity leave.

Common-law punitive damages in Connecticut cannot exceed the plaintiff's costs of litigation less his taxable costs, and litigation expenses may include reasonable attorneys fees. <italic>Berry</italic><italic>v. Loiseau, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>233 Conn. 832</cross_reference> (1992). The extent of punitive damages is in the discretion of the trier of fact. <italic>Chykirda v.</italic><italic>Yanush,</italic> <cross_reference>131 Conn. 565</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>568</cross_reference> (1945); <italic>Wedig v. Brinster,</italic><cross_reference>1 Conn.App. 123</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>134-35</cross_reference> (1983).

Similarly, statutorily allowable punitive damages awarded pursuant to CUTPA are left to the trial court's discretion; General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-110g</cross_reference>(a); and an award of "reasonable" attorneys fees under CUTPA is discretionary with the further caveat that it is to be based on work "reasonably" performed, and not on the amount of recovery. <italic>Id.</italic> §§ 42-110(d) and (e).

The Connecticut Appellate Court has held that the factors set out in the decision of <italic>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express,</italic><italic>Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>488 F.2d 714</cross_reference> (5th Cir. 1974) should be applied in CUTPA cases to determine the reasonableness of fees. <italic>Steiger v. J.S.</italic><italic>Builders, Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>39 Conn.App. 32</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>38</cross_reference> (1955). These factors are:

1. the time and labor required;

2. the novelty and difficulty of the questions;

3. the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; CT Page 10722

4. the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case;

5. the customary fee for similar work in the community;

6. whether the fee is fixed or contingent;

7. time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances;

8. the amount involved and results obtained;

9. the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys;

10. the "undesirability" of the case;

11. the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and

12. awards in similar cases.

In reviewing the reasonableness of this attorneys fees application the court makes the following observations. First, plaintiffs' law firm is a large and well respected firm based in Connecticut. The economics of this and similar firms which, in part, reflect the expectations and demands placed on them by clients, result in relatively high billing rates. In this case, the hourly rates charged Mr. Brown for attorney time ranged from $360 to $165 per hour and $145 to $165 for paralegal time. These rates are high, but are not, <italic>per se,</italic> unreasonable.

Second, the plaintiff and his counsel were successful to the extent the jury returned a favorable verdict on the five causes of action submitted to it. Furthermore, counsel's work in court and written submissions was competent. Third, plaintiff and his counsel are commended for taking some steps, noted above, to eliminate certain billable hours. The court also notes that most of the attorney time spent in pursuing the claims cannot be readily segregated by specific claim, since the evidence was so overlapping. Therefore, the fee request will not be reduced by attempting to apportion the fees to work performed on the CUTPA claim or the claims where the jury found a basis for common-law punitive damages.

The course of this case was relatively straight forward. Brown CT Page 10723 served a nine-count complaint dated March 25, 2003 and sought preliminary relief in the form of a temporary injunction and a prejudgment remedy in excess of $1.1 million, a figure later reduced to $675,000. A hearing took place over three days in early May 2003 before the Honorable William Lewis, JTR who rendered a decision in November 2003 granting an attachment of $88,000 on the Palumberis' residence in Bethel, Connecticut and denying any injunctive relief.

In the interim, the matter was transferred to the Complex Litigation Docket. A case management order was entered with the consent of the parties setting a trial exposure date of February 1, 2005, and in fact, jury selection began on that date. During the spring of 2004 and again shortly before trial, Brown sought and obtained adjudication of certain motions requiring the defendants to collect and turn over certain business and financial records which had not been produced earlier.

At trial the plaintiff called three witnesses: Brown, Lisa Palumberi and Allen Kosowsky, an expert in business valuation who testified about damages. The defendants called Frank Palumberi and Scott Mitchell a CPA who had prepared tax returns for the three jointly owned companies and who prepared a preliminary recommendation for splitting up the companies. The plaintiff put eleven and the defendant's eight exhibits into evidence.

In the context of this case attorneys fees and costs well in excess of $300,000.00 are excessive and unreasonable. The issues presented by the claims and defenses were not overly difficult. Indeed, the evidence required to prove each of the five claims was largely identical. This was evidenced by the short list of witnesses and the fact that the jury found that the damages proved under each claim were the same. While this court will not criticize thoroughness and preparation by attorneys, there was simply too much time spent on certain matters involved in the litigation and this engendered unreasonable fees and costs. A few examples will suffice to make the point. Well over $50,000 in fees had been incurred prior to the hearing before Judge Lewis in early May 2003. This included 28.4 hours of time spent by four attorneys and one paralegal mostly on reading depositions of Frank and Lisa Palumberi which apparently had been taken in the litigation which preceded this one. In June and July 2003 Brown's attorneys recorded 93 hours billed at $21,629.50 preparing a post-hearing brief to submit to Judge Lewis and another ten hours to prepare a three-page reply all in support of the request for a CT Page 10724 $675,000 prejudgment remedy and injunctive relief.

In January 2005, the month prior to commencement of jury selection, approximately 200 hours of attorney time was spent on trial preparation engendering fees in excess of $50,000. The plaintiff's expert Kosowsky who testified for less than two hours on direct and cross examination charged over $22,000 for some fairly straight forward preparation and testimony about the division of assets and revenues of the three companies.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

The plaintiff encountered some difficulties in obtaining bank records of the Palumberis and the three jointly owned companies. This was due in part to the defendants' inattentiveness to their discovery responsibilities and to alleged water damage to certain records. Plaintiffs' counsel spent some time litigating these discovery issues. In the final event, however, only a number of bank deposit slips showing deposits into Wilton Carting in early 2002 were entered into evidence and these exhibits were almost unremarked upon during trial.

Having considered the above matters, and the factors set forth in <italic>Steiger,</italic> the court determines the attorneys fee request should be reduced by 40% to meet the standard of reasonableness. While this is a significant reduction, the allowable fees still amount to over $8,000 per month from the time the complaint was filed until verdict, a substantial sum in light of the nature of the case.

Pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-110g</cross_reference>(d) the court has discretion to award costs to a prevailing party in a CUTPA action. In a memorandum of decision, dated today, this court in<italic>Gerner v. Applied Industrial Materials Corporation,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, Complex Litigation Docket, X08 CV 02 0192069 (<cross_reference>36 Conn. L. Rptr. 576</cross_reference>) determined that CUTPA permitted an award of non-taxable litigation costs despite at least two recent Superior Court decisions to the contrary which were based on <italic>Miller v.</italic><italic>Guimaraes,</italic> <cross_reference>78 Conn.App. 760</cross_reference> (2003). For the reasons stated in<italic>Gerner,</italic> this court does not interpret <italic>Guimaraes</italic> as forbidding the granting of non-taxable costs in a CUTPA case. Of course, another basis for awarding non-taxable costs is found in the Connecticut law of common-law punitive damages. Therefore, the plaintiffs' request is granted; however, the amount of allowable costs is reduced by 40% of the requested amount. CT Page 10725

<center>                          <italic>III. Punitive Damages</italic></center>
The plaintiff seeks an additional $100,000 in punitive damages. As noted above, the amount of punitive damages under CUTPA (which may be awarded in addition to attorneys fees) is within the trial court's discretion, and the amount of common-law punitive damages is similarly a matter of the court's discretion.

In considering punitive damages the court is mindful of several factors. The first is that a close cousin of punitive damages has already been assessed against the defendants by the verdict of three times the compensatory damages rendered on the statutory theft count. Second, the defendants, as set forth above, will be ordered to pay an additional amount as reasonable attorneys fees and costs — an amount which by itself is equal to four times the compensatory damages.

Third, this court heard and saw the same evidence that was presented to the jury. While respecting the jury findings and concluding (although not called upon to do so in the absence of any motions by the defendants), there was sufficient evidence that a jury could reasonably make such findings, this court saw no real evidence of malice or evil motive on the part of the defendants. Certainly they acted unilaterally and willfully, but not with any deliberate attempt to inflict unjustified injury.

Under these circumstances the court sees no point or justification in adding another level of damages to those damages and costs which are already imposed. The request for punitive damages is denied.

<center>                               <italic>Conclusion</italic></center>
The plaintiff is awarded $184,950.90 in attorneys fees and $19,627.20 in non-taxable costs.

So Ordered.
