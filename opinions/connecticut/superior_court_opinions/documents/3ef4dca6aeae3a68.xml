<opinion_text><unpublished>  Plaintiff's motion for a protective order, dated August 29, 2003, seeks an order prohibiting the defendant from deposing a Dr. Willie Coleman who was subpoenaed pursuant to a notice of deposition on August 8, 2003. The defendant attempts to depose the psychologist on issues unrelated to the diagnosis and treatment. Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.) ยง<cross_reference>52-146c</cross_reference>(3) define communications between a person and a psychologist as:

<block_quote>  "Communications" means all oral and written communications and records thereof relating to the diagnosis and treatment of a person between such person and a psychologist or between a member of such person's family and a psychologist.</block_quote>

The defendant seeks to depose the psychologist on areas immaterial to the issue of diagnosis and treatment for a mental condition. The defendant, at a hearing on December 7, 2001, was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to aid the court in determining issues of custody and visitation. The defendant waived privilege as to diagnosis and treatment of mental condition by consenting to a court-ordered examination by a psychiatrist (see C.G.S. ยง <cross_reference>52-146d</cross_reference>.) The waiver of the privilege deals with communications concerning diagnosis and treatment.

The plaintiff, in error, sought and obtained an evaluation from a psychologist not in compliance with the court order. The Court brought said deficiency to the attention of the counsel for the plaintiff and defendant after the psychologist's report was circulated to counsel but not the court.

The plaintiff to comply with the court order of December 7, 2001 then scheduled and completed an evaluation by a psychiatrist who in turn included reference to the psychologist's evaluation in his report. CT Page 13239

The plaintiff intends to depose the psychologist and question him as to areas immaterial to the diagnosis and treatment of a mental condition. Communications between a psychologist and his or her patient are admissible only on issues involving the person's psychological condition. [C.G.S. ยง <cross_reference>52-146c</cross_reference>(1).] Furthermore, the plaintiff was not informed by the court prior to its order requiring him to be evaluated by a psychiatrist (not a psychologist) that any communications made to the psychiatrist not dealing with the issue of diagnosis and/or treatment of a mental condition would be included in the evaluation and/or admissible in court.

Based upon the above analysis, the court hereby orders that the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, dated August 29, 2003, is granted.
