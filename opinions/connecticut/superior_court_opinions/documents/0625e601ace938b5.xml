On March 5, 2008, the plaintiffs, Alba Ruano and her two minor children, Jamie Vega and Alba Vega-Ruano, filed a three-count complaint sounding in negligence against the defendants, Gilder Carias and Enio Martinez. The plaintiffs allege that on or about April 15, 2006, while operating a motor vehicle on a Stamford street, Ruano was violently struck by another vehicle. The plaintiffs contend that the collision was caused when the vehicle, owned by Martinez and operated by Carias, crossed into Ruano's lane of travel resulting in injury to her and her two passenger children.

On June 30, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a twelve-count amended complaint in which, for the first time, they assert claims of intoxication against the defendants. Counts one, two and three are brought by Ruano against Carias and sound in negligence, recklessness and statutory recklessness, respectively. Count four is brought by Ruano against Martinez and sounds in respondeat superior. Similarly, counts five, six, and seven brought by Vega against Carias allege negligence, recklessness and statutory recklessness, respectively. Count eight sounds in respondeat superior and is brought by Vega against Martinez. Counts nine, ten and eleven, asserting claims of negligence, recklessness, and statutory recklessness, respectively, are brought by Vega-Ruano against Carias. Count twelve, sounding in respondeat superior, is brought by Vega-Ruano against Martinez. In addition, the prayer for relief attached to the amended complaint seeks punitive damages, attorney fees and double or treble damages pursuant to General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>14-295</cross_reference>.

On July 21, 2008, the defendants filed an objection to the plaintiffs' amended complaint asserting that such claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>52-584</cross_reference>. This objection was overruled by Judge Karazin on August 11, 2008. On September 10, 2008, the defendants filed a motion to strike the second, third, CT Page 20580 sixth, seventh, tenth and eleventh counts of the amended complaint. The defendants allege that those counts are barred by the statute of limitation as they incorporate facts which do not relate back to the original complaint and, therefore, are pled in an untimely manner. For the reasons set forth below, the court denies the defendants' motion to strike.

<center>                           II. Discussion of Law</center>
"The purpose of a motion to strike is to contest . . . the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaint . . . to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC v. Alves</italic>, <cross_reference>262 Conn. 480</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>498</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>815 A.2d 1188</cross_reference>
(2003). "It is fundamental that in determining the sufficiency of a complaint challenged by a defendant's motion to strike, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Violano v. Fernandez</italic>,<cross_reference>280 Conn. 310</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>907 A.2d 1188</cross_reference> (2006). It does not, however, admit legal conclusions or the truth or accuracy of opinions stated in the pleadings. <italic>Faulkner v. United Technologies Corp.</italic>, <cross_reference>240 Conn. 576</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>588</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>693 A.2d 293</cross_reference> (1997).

"A motion to strike is properly granted if the complaint alleges mere conclusions of law that are unsupported by the facts alleged." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC v. Alves,</italic><italic>supra</italic>, <cross_reference>262 Conn. 498</cross_reference>. "If any facts provable under the express and implied allegations in the plaintiff's complaint support a cause of action . . . the complaint is not vulnerable to a motion to strike."<italic>Bouchard v. People's Bank</italic>, <cross_reference>219 Conn. 465</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>471</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>594 A.2d 1</cross_reference> (1991).

Generally, "[a] claim that an action is barred by the lapse of the statute of limitations must be pleaded as a special defense, not raised by a motion to strike." <italic>Forbes v. Ballaro</italic>, <cross_reference>31 Conn.App. 235</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>239</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>624 A.2d 389</cross_reference> (1993). There are, however, exceptions to this rule which allow the use of a motion to strike to raise the defense of the statute of limitations. It is proper to use a motion to strike "when [t]he parties agree that the complaint sets forth all the facts pertinent to the question of whether the action is barred by the [s]tatute of [l]imitations." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic> In the present case, the plaintiffs have conceded in their memorandum of law "that all the facts necessary to the determination of whether the statute of limitations defense [applies] were set forth in the complaint." It is, therefore, proper for this court to consider the defense in the context of a motion to strike.

CT Page 20581 The defendants' motion to strike counts two, three, six, seven, ten and eleven of the plaintiffs' amended complaint is premised on the contention that these counts are bared by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to tort actions under ยง <cross_reference>52-584</cross_reference>. The defendants argue that the addition of allegations of intoxication, pled in the amended complaint, but completely absent from the original complaint, create distinctly separate causes of action which are not remedied by the relation back doctrine. The plaintiffs contend that the addition of allegations of intoxication into the amended complaint merely incorporates alternative theories of recovery all based upon the same essential facts. As such, the plaintiffs argue that the facts pled in the amended complaint relate back to the date of the original complaint and are not time barred.

A party may amplify allegations contained in a complaint provided the character of the cause of action remains substantially the same.<italic>Wagner v. Clark Equipment Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>259 Conn. 114</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>129-30</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>788 A.2d 83</cross_reference>
(2002). "A cause of action is that single group of facts which is claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff and which entitles the plaintiff to relief . . . It is proper to amplify or expand what has already been alleged in support of a cause of action, provided the identity of the cause of action remains substantially the same, but whe[n] an entirely new and different factual situation is presented, a new and different cause of action is stated." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Dimmock v. Lawrence  Memorial Hospital,</italic><italic>Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>286 Conn. 789</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>798</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>945 A.2d 955</cross_reference> (2008). A change in, or addition to, a ground of negligence or an act of negligence arising out of the single group of facts which was originally claimed to have brought about the unlawful injury to the plaintiff does not change the cause of action. <italic>Alswanger v. Smego</italic>, <cross_reference>257 Conn. 58</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>64-65</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>776 A.2d 444</cross_reference> (2001).

"Our relation back doctrine provides that an amendment relates back when the original complaint has given the party fair notice that a claim is being asserted stemming from a particular transaction or occurrence, thereby serving the objectives of our statute of limitations, namely, to protect parties from having to defend against stale claims . . ." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Deming v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co.</italic>,<cross_reference>279 Conn. 745</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>775</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>905 A.2d 623</cross_reference> (2006). Accordingly, an amended complaint "relate[s] back to the date of the original complaint unless it alleges a new cause of action." <italic>Franc v. Bethel Holding Co.</italic>,<cross_reference>73 Conn.App. 114</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>136</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>807 A.2d 519</cross_reference> cert. granted on other grounds,<cross_reference>262 Conn. 923</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>812 A.2d 864</cross_reference> (2002) (appeal withdrawn October 21, 2003).

This court believes that <italic>Gurliacci v. Mayer</italic>, <cross_reference>218 Conn. 531</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>590 A.2d 914</cross_reference>
(1991) is instructive and controlling in the present case. The <italic>Gurliacci</italic>
court was asked to decide whether the addition of allegations of CT Page 20582 willful, wanton and malicious conduct in an amended complaint, to a claim of negligent operation of a motor vehicle as pled in the original complaint, was time barred. Equating Connecticut's relation back doctrine to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court reiterated that "[w]henever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading . . . The policy behind rule 15(c) is that a party, once notified of litigation based upon a particular transaction or occurrence, has been provided with all the notice that statutes of limitations are intended to afford." (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic>, 547-48. The court noted that "the [purpose] of our statute of limitations [is] to protect parties from having to defend against stale claims." <italic>Id.</italic>, 548. The court stated that this purpose is fully served "when fair notice that a claim is being asserted stemming from a particular transaction or occurrence" is given.<italic>Id.</italic> In ruling that the amendment related back to the original pleading, the court noted that the plaintiffs' amendment reiterated the negligence and expanded the previous allegations, but did not inject two different sets of circumstances or facts. <italic>Id.</italic>, 549.

There are two Superior Court cases with facts very similar to those in the present case, both of which followed the reasoning and result in<italic>Gurliacci</italic>. See, <italic>Lugauskas v. Reis</italic>, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 00 0161575 (November 29, 2001, Rogers, J.) (31 Conn. L. Rptr. 68); <italic>Cyr v.</italic><italic>Fahey</italic>, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 04 0351231 (September 22, 2004, Bellis, J.). In <italic>Lugauskas</italic>, the plaintiff alleged in her original one-count complaint sounding in negligence, that while crossing a street, she had been struck by an automobile driven by the defendant. In her amended complaint, which added claims of common-law recklessness and double or treble damages, the plaintiff alleged, for the first time, the defendant's intoxication. In response, the defendant raised a statute of limitations defense and argued that the plaintiff's recklessness claims were time barred. The issue addressed by the court in <italic>Lugauskas</italic> was whether the allegations asserted in the new counts of the amended complaint related back to the original complaint.

The court concluded that because "[the plaintiff's] allegations of recklessness [arose] from the same circumstances that gave rise to her original cause of action in negligence . . . [the defendant] was on fair notice that a claim was being asserted against him arising out of the alleged accident." <italic>Lugauskas v. Reis, supra</italic>, 31 Conn. L. Rptr. 70. The court reasoned that "the single group of facts which were claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff . . . [was the defendant's] alleged negligent driving . . ." <italic>Id.</italic>, 70-71. The "allegation CT Page 20583 of intoxication merely `amplifies' or `expands' what has already been alleged." <italic>Id.</italic>, 70. As such, the court ruled that the plaintiff's "new claims relate[d] back to the filing of [the] original complaint and [were therefore] not time barred by the applicable statute of limitations."<italic>Id.</italic>, 71.

Similarly, in <italic>Cyr v. Fahey</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 04 0351231, the plaintiff filed a one-count complaint alleging negligence arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff filed a request for leave to file an amended complaint, adding for the first time counts in common-law and statutory recklessness incorporating allegations of intoxication. In overruling on the defendants' objection to the amendment, the court stated that because the amendment alleged identical facts pertaining to the injury, namely the motor vehicle accident, the amendment related back to the original complaint and was not time barred by the statue of limitations. <italic>Id.</italic>

The court is not unmindful of the holding in <italic>Sharp v. Mitchell</italic>,<cross_reference>209 Conn. 59</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>546 A.2d 846</cross_reference> (1988). <italic>Sharp</italic> was an appeal in a wrongful death action involving the asphyxiation of three men in an underground fuel storage facility. The court was asked to decide whether an amended complaint alleging that the defendant had negligently designed and constructed the storage facility related back to the original complaint. That complaint asserted negligence in ordering the employees to enter the hazardous area, but did not assert any claim of negligent construction or design of the facility itself.

The <italic>Sharp</italic> court held that the amended complaint did not relate back to the original pleading, and was thereby time barred. <italic>Id.</italic>, 73. The court reasoned that the complaints involved two different sets of circumstances dependent upon different facts to prove or disprove the allegations of a different basis of liability. <italic>Id.</italic> Such vast distinctions, the court concluded, would unfairly prejudice the defendants who had notice only of the alleged negligence in ordering employees into the location as opposed to the negligent construction of the facility itself. <italic>Id.</italic>

<center>                              III. Conclusion</center>
In the present case, the challenged counts in the amended complaint each add an allegation that the defendant, Carias, was driving under the influence, an allegation that was not present in the original complaint claiming negligence. It is clear, however, that the allegations of recklessness in the plaintiffs' amended complaint arise from the same circumstances that gave rise to the original cause of action in negligence. The single group of facts that are claimed to have brought CT Page 20584 about an unlawful injury to the plaintiffs is Carias's conduct in the operation of the vehicle he was operating. Accordingly, the added allegations of recklessness do not inject two different sets of circumstances, but merely amplify or expand what has already been alleged in the original complaint. As such, this court believes that <italic>Gurliacci</italic>, not <italic>Sharp</italic>, is controlling. When the plaintiffs commenced their original complaint, the defendants were on fair notice that a claim was being asserted against them arising out of the alleged accident. As the claims in the amended complaint relate back to the original complaint they are not barred by the statute of limitations.

For the forgoing reasons, the defendants' motion to strike is, therefore, denied.
