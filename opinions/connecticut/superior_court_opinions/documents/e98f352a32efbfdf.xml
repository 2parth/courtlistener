</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff is a licensed residential real estate appraiser doing business as Leighton Appraisal Services. The defendant Petmak Mortgage, LLC is a licensed mortgage lender. It also provides residential appraisal services for other lending institutions. The defendant, Jarlath Paul Ramoya, is the owner of Petmak, LLC (Petmak). When Petmak gets a request for a residential appraisal it hires an appraisal service such as the plaintiff to appraise the property and it forwards the completed appraisal to its clients. Petmak does not restrict its referrals to one appraisal service, but did refer several appraisals to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff utilizes a software program called Alamode in its appraisals. When the appraisal is complete he forwards it to Petmak via computer. All his appraisals contain his Connecticut license number and his signature, which is electronically copied into the appraisal.

The signature is scanned from an original and, using a private password, is thereafter electronically reproduced in the computer generated appraisal report. According to the plaintiff the system is supposed to be tamper-proof. No one can access the appraisal to change it in any way and, when transferred to another computer it can be printed on a hard copy, or viewed on the computer screen, but it cannot be altered or modified.

In June 2005, the plaintiff was made aware that fourteen fraudulent appraisals were prepared under his name and submitted to mortgage lenders. Not only were the appraisals fraudulent, they contained serious deficiencies in descriptions and even used non-existent properties as comparable sales. These fraudulent appraisals were submitted under the plaintiff's name and listed CT Page 15948 his license number. Somehow, the plaintiff's electronically copied signature also appeared on the appraisals. The plaintiff, in fact, did not do the appraisals but nonetheless, claims to have lost business because of the defective appraisals submitted under his name. Because all fourteen fraudulent appraisals were ordered by Petmak, the plaintiff suspected Petmak or Mr. Ramoya were behind the fraud, and brought suit alleging fraud, unjust enrichment, emotional distress and defamation. He now applies for a receivership for Petmak, or an attachment pre-judgment.

The plaintiff has the burden of establishing probable cause that judgment will be rendered in his favor and also establishing the probability that damages will be awarded in the amount of any attachment. Probable cause has been defined as a bona fide belief in facts essential under the law for the action such as would lead a reasonably prudent person to entertain such belief.<italic>Dufraineu v. CHRO,</italic> <cross_reference>236 Conn. 250</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>261</cross_reference> (1996).

The Court does not believe the plaintiff has met his burden.

The defendant, Mr. Ramoya, testified all fourteen of the fraudulent appraisals had been referred by his firm to Accurate Appraisal Service, a business owned by one Mark Ganley. Mr. Ganley had done many appraisals for Petmak and there was never any problem until 2004 when the fourteen fraudulent appraisals were exposed.

Mr. Ramoya was first made aware of the potential problem from Attorney Andrew Kearns who handled most of his mortgage closings. Attorney Kearns heard, at a closing, that the Banking Commission was looking into appraisals involving Mr. Ganley and cautioned Mr. Ramoya to stay away from Mr. Ganley. Mr. Ramoya has had nothing to do with him since.

Mr. Ramoya was visited by the police but he was never charged with anything and believes an agency other than the Vernon Police now is investigating. No police action was taken against Mr. Ramoya or by the Banking Commission either.

Mr. Leighton has no evidence that Petmak or Mr. Ramoya did anything fraudulent. Essentially his claim is that because all the fraudulent appraisals were referred to Mr. Ganley by Petmak, that establishes probable cause. The Court disagrees.

Mark Ganley was not called as a witness by either side. Whether CT Page 15949 he is available was not established, but it appears more probable that Mr. Ganley may have acted fraudulently rather then Mr. Ramoya. There was no evidence Mr. Ramoya was acting in concert with Mr. Ganley and the plaintiff has no idea how anyone could access his computer program. His claim that somehow Mr. Ramoya was responsible is simply speculative and without supporting evidence.

The plaintiff's claim that Petmak's records lack sufficient specificity to show that it paid Mr. Ganley for the fraudulent appraisals (as Mr. Ramoya testified he did), and that is evidence of some irregularity on the part of the defendants, lacks evidentiary persuasiveness. Petmak produced its check register showing a number of payments made to Mr. Ganley. Mr. Ramoya explained that Ganley did not typically send invoices identifying the specific properties he was requesting payment for appraising, that he usually called Petmak asking for payment and orally identifying the properties. Their detailed office records are not kept permanently, but are shredded after an annual Banking Commission audit. The most recent audit was in November 2004. Some appraisers do send invoices for payment while others do not. The Court cannot infer from this testimony, fraudulent activity or scheming between Mr. Ramoya and Mr. Ganley as the plaintiff suggests.

In summary the evidence has not persuaded the Court there is probable cause to conclude the plaintiff is likely to prevail at trial against Petmak or Ramoya, nor was there satisfactory evidence to establish the probable financial loss to the plaintiff (aside from perhaps the loss of fourteen appraisals, which at most would be $7,000, assuming all were multiple family dwellings).

Accordingly, the application for pre-judgment attachment or appointment of a receiver is denied. CT Page 15950
