</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This case is an appeal under ยง <cross_reference>12-117a</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The court shall have power to grant such relief as to justice and equity appertains, upon such terms and in such manner and form as appear equitable. If the assessment made by the board of tax review or board of assessment appeals, as the case may be, is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes, together with interest and any costs awarded by the court, or, at the applicant's option, shall be granted a tax credit for such overpayment, interest and any costs awarded by the court. Upon motion, said court shall, in event of such overpayment, enter judgment in favor of such applicant and against such city or town for the whole amount of such overpayment, together with interest and any costs awarded by the court. The amount to which the assessment is so reduced shall be the assessed value of such property on the grand lists for succeeding years until the tax assessor finds that the value of the applicant's property has increased or decreased, of the Connecticut General Statutes, of the 100% valuation of the property owned by the appellants G. Ernest Anderson and Patricia M. Anderson at 152 Overshores Drive East, Madison, Connecticut as of October 1, 2002. The appellants used the opinion as to value of Phillip W. Ball, appraiser, whose report was introduced in evidence. The report concludes that the actual fair market value (100%) as of October 1, 2002 is $620,000.

The Town of Madison valuated the fair market value of the property at $944,700, as evidenced by the Tax Assessor's field card. The City evaluates property for tax purposes (assessment) at 70% of actual value. Accordingly, the assessment was broken down as follows.

The Town of Madison assessed the property as follows as of October 1, 2002: CT Page 15412

<block_quote>Land        $581,700 Building     $76,300 Garage        $3,400 ______________ Total     $661,400 (70%)</block_quote>

The fair market value (100%) is calculated by the Town of Madison to be $944,000.

In a 1998 assessment, this property was valued at $136,500 reflecting a fair market value of $195,000. The appellant questions what amounts to an increment of approximately 500% over a four-year period.

The appellants commenced this action by way of a Summons and Application for Appeal from the Town of Madison's Board of Assessment Appeals bearing a return date of May 27, 2003. The appellants allege that the assessment and valuation by the Town of Madison are grossly excessive, disproportionate and unlawful. The appellants request that the court determine the true and actual fair market value of the property as of October 1, 2002 and reduce the assessed valuation of this property to seventy percent (70%) of its true and actual fair market value. Additionally the appellants request that the court order a refund of any overpayment made by the appellants as a result of the excessive valuation, along with statutory interest. The appellants also claim costs, including the appraisal and expert witness fees.

A trial in this matter was held on June 15, 2004. The court heard testimony from Patricia C. Hedwall, the Assessor for the Town of Madison, plaintiff Patricia M. Anderson, and Philip W. Ball, a licensed real estate appraiser. Prior to the commencement of testimony the court had granted the appellants' motion in limine precluding the use of an appraisal prepared by the appellee, Town of Madison. The appraisal was prepared on or about June 1, 2004 and was mailed to the appellants. The court ruled that the appraisal was untimely supplied to the appellants pursuant to the standing orders of the court regarding pending tax appeals. The standing orders mandate that appraisals be exchanged between the parties two weeks prior to pretrial and at least four weeks prior to trial. The standing orders clearly state that failure to comply may result in preclusion of the use of the undisclosed evidence at trial. The court's orders also CT Page 15413 provide that, if after pretrial, the municipality elects to do an appraisal, in addition to the assessor's evaluation, it shall have four weeks from the pretrial date to supply a copy of its appraisal to the appellants.

The pretrial in this matter was scheduled for October 16, 2003. Therefore, pursuant to the standing orders of the court, the Town had four weeks from October 16, 2003 to provide the Andersons with any copy of an appraisal which the Town wished to introduce at trial. The Town of Madison failed to comply with these standing orders of the court. Therefore, the Town's appraisal of June 1, 2004, was precluded.

Before addressing the merits of the parties' claims, the court first sets forth the well-settled legal principles underlying a ยง<cross_reference>12-117a</cross_reference> tax appeal. "In ยง <cross_reference>12-117a</cross_reference> tax appeals, the trial court tries the matter de novo and the ultimate question is the ascertainment of the true and actual value of the [taxpayer's] property . . . At the de novo proceeding, the taxpayer bears the burden of establishing that the assessor has over assessed its property . . . Once the taxpayer has demonstrated aggrievement by proving that its property was over assessed, the trial court [will] then undertake a further inquiry to determine the amount of the reassessment that would be just . . . The trier of fact must arrive at [its] own conclusions as to the value of [the taxpayer's property] by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value . . ." <italic>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v.</italic><italic>Middletown,</italic> <cross_reference>77 Conn.App. 21</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>25-26</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>822 A.2d 974</cross_reference> (2003).

The subject property is a generally rectangular shaped, water-influenced lot, designated to contain .13 acres. The parcel is on the north side of the "U" created by the junction of Overshores Drive East and Overshores Drive West. The parcel is opposite the Overshores Association's commonly owned access to its beach frontage along Long Island Sound. The subject parcel has an unobstructed view of the water. Overshores Drive East, the location of the subject parcel, is a secondary residential two-way street. Many of the homes located here were originally summer cottages. The parcel is small, graded and landscaped and it is serviced by city water with a private septic system. The property is located in both a FEMA designated flood hazard area, as well as, a Coastal Area Management District. Zoning is designated as an R-2 Zone, which is a single-family residential CT Page 15414 zone, requiring a minimum lot area of 40,000 square feet. The subject property does not conform to present bulk requirements, but is allowed to continue its non-conforming use, as it existed prior to implementation of the present zoning. These factors are relevant to the issue of future re-building and land use should the present structure be destroyed or demolished.

The parcel is improved with a two-story, frame converted cottage, estimated to contain 1,652 square feet of finished living area and a large screen front porch. There is no basement. The first floor contains a living room with a fireplace, a dining room, a kitchen, bath and a small utility room. The second floor has four bedrooms and a bath. The interior is drywall and wood construction and the exterior is painted wood shingles with an asphalt roof. Heating is electric baseboard and there is no central air-conditioning system. There is a small detached two-car garage. The dwelling was constructed approximately 70 years ago and is in an average to good condition. The lot size is 5,800 square feet. The present improvements contribute value to the underlying land and, therefore, are its highest and best use.

The appellants' appraiser, after considering different approaches as to value, determined that the best approach to use was the market data and direct sales comparison because it reflects the decision-making process of the typical purchaser and actual conditions in the marketplace. The court agrees. Thus, the appraiser considered four sales of water-influenced homes in Madison occurring between October 31, 2001 and September 3, 2002.

The first property at 132 Overshores Drive East was sold on October 31, 2001 for the price of $460,000. The lot size was 10,000 square feet and the building size was 2,482 square feet. It was a two-story, frame-converted cottage with seven rooms, four bedrooms, three baths, two wood decks, vinyl siding, beach rights in superior condition.

The second sale was April 30, 2002, at 56 Middle Beach Road, Madison. The sales price was $975,000. The lot size was 20,500 square feet and the building size was 3,131 square feet. The building is a 2.23-story cottage, which was converted and fully renovated in 1990. It contains ten rooms, six bedrooms, three baths, one lavatory, an open porch and a detached garage. It has an obstructed water view and contains central air conditioning. It is in a superior location, but has an inferior view. CT Page 15415

The third sale was 40 Shorelands, Madison for a price of $420,000 on May 1, 2002. The lot contains 26,200 square feet and the building size is 1,704 square feet. It is a 1.66-story and basement, frame construction Cape Cod dwelling with six rooms, four bedrooms, two baths, a large screen porch, two-car detached garage and beach rights. It has no water view, but is located in a similar location as the subject property and is in better condition.

The fourth sale used by the appellants' appraiser was 100 Kelsey Place, Madison. It sold for $754,000 on September 3, 2002. The lot contained 24,500 square feet and the building contained 2,383 square feet. It is two stories with a partial basement. It is Colonial style and was remodeled approximately 20 years ago. It has eight rooms, four bedrooms, two baths, one lavatory and a two-car garage with a living area above the garage. It has deeded beach rights, and it has a partial water view. It is in superior condition.

At the request of the appellants, the court also takes judicial notice<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> of <italic>Liebert v. Town of Madison,</italic> No. CV 03-0477259 Superior Court, judicial District of New Haven at Meriden May 6, 2004, DeMayo, JTR, a tax assessment appeal involving property at 157 Overshores Drive West, a parcel which is located in close proximity to the appellants' property. The property at this location has a much larger lot and is waterfront property with access to the same beach as the appellants' property. That assessment was for $779,800, reflective of a 100 percent evaluation of $1,113,800. The court in <italic>Liebert</italic>
concluded that the fair market value of 157 Overshores Drive West on October 1, 2002 was $700,000. The assessor for the Town of Madison concedes that the decision in <italic>Liebert v. Town of</italic><italic>Madison, supra,</italic> was not appealed.

The tax assessor in the present matter testified that the Liebert property at 157 Overshores Drive West is more valuable than the appellant's property at 152 Overshores Drive East. The lot size of the Liebert property was admitted by the Assessor to be at least three times larger than the appellants' property. The Assessor also testified that other similar properties in the immediate area and larger than the appellants' property have sold for less than the market value of $944,700 which has been assessed for the appellants' property. The Assessor in justifying the market value ascribed by the Town to the appellants' property, relied primarily on the fact that the appellants' CT Page 15416 property was water view and not on sales or appraisals of comparable properties. The Assessor argues that the comparable property sales used by the appellants' appraiser were a greater distance from the water than the subject parcel. However, she concedes that three of the comparable sales do, in fact, have beach rights and access to the association beach. The fourth comparable sale has a view of the salt marsh and has no access to the association beach. The court notes, however, that the Town chose not to cross-examine the appellants' appraiser regarding the contents of his appraisal report and the conclusions he reached regarding the assessed value and fair market value of the appellants' property.

The Town of Madison conducted its revaluation using the mass appraisal technique commonly used for determining values for municipalities. This methodology has been approved by the Office of Policy and Management of the State of Connecticut. No one from Vision Appraisal, the company who compiled the revaluation information, was present to testify. The Assessor under cross-examination stated that while the mass appraisal technique is generally accurate, mistakes can occur. The Town has conceded that in addition to the parcel involved in <italic>Liebert v. Town of</italic><italic>Madison, supra,</italic> there was an additional parcel on Overshores Drives owned by "Barnaby" that was valued by Vision Appraisal Company at a market value of $3,237,500, which the Town later reduced to $1,180,000.

<center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
The appellee has been unable to weaken or negate conclusions of Mr. Ball, the appellants' appraiser. This is particularly true with respect to the comparable sales utilized by Mr. Ball. The appellee chose not to cross-examine him. The court's decision in<italic>Liebert v. Town of Madison, supra,</italic> is also an indication of an over-evaluation of the appellants' property, as is the Town's reduction of value for the Barnaby property. This court recognizes that the decision in <italic>Liebert</italic> does not set forth specifics regarding the attributes and size of the <italic>Liebert</italic>
property, but it does find the decision informative. While the court also did not have the specific information regarding the characteristics of the parcel referred to as the "Barnaby" property, this property is useful to the court, in that it is an example of flaws in the mass appraisal technique used by Vision Associates. CT Page 15417

In this instance, the court finds the appellant has presented the more reasonable hypothesis for valuing the appellants' property. Consequently, for the reasons noted above, the court concludes that the fair market value of the subject property on October 1, 2002 was $620,000. The assessed value at 70% of fair market value is found to be $434,000.

The appellant are entitled to their court costs and additionally, the court will award an appraiser's fee of $450 for the appraisal and $1,000 for the appraiser's day in court. The court further orders that the appellants shall be reimbursed by the Town of Madison for any overpayment of taxes, with interest thereon, in accordance with the judgment of this court, pursuant to General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>12-117a</cross_reference> and ยง <cross_reference>12-119</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

<block_quote>  Such application may be made within one year from the date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation and shall be served and returned in the same manner as is required in the case of a summons in a civil action, and the pendency of such application shall not suspend action upon the tax against the applicant. In all such actions, the Superior Court shall have power to grant such relief upon such terms and in such manner and form as to justice and equity appertains, and costs may be taxed at the discretion of the court. If such assessment is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes in accordance with the judgment of said court.</block_quote></footnote_body>
