The plaintiff, Barry Saunders, individually and derivatively on behalf of Adco Medical Supplies, Inc. (Adco) and Barbur Associates, LLC (Barbur) has filed an eighteen-count third amended complaint dated January 20, 2006 against the defendants Burton Firtel, Norma Firtel and Adco Medical Supplies, Inc.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The plaintiff Saunders claims money damages, interest, costs, and an accounting. Additionally, the plaintiff seeks attorneys fees pursuant to General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>31-72</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>42-110a</cross_reference> et seq.; double damages pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>31-72</cross_reference>; treble damages pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-564</cross_reference>, and punitive damages pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-110a</cross_reference>, et seq.

In response, the defendants Burton Firtel and Norma Firtel have filed their Revised Answer, Special Defenses and Counterclaim dated June 1, 2006, and the defendant Adco has filed its Revised Answer, Special Defenses and Counterclaim dated May 24, 2006. The plaintiff has filed a motion to strike three of the six special defenses filed by each of the defendants claiming that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The plaintiff's motion to strike is dated July 11, 2006 and argues that the special defenses claiming that the plaintiff lacks standing should be stricken because the court has already held by way of a previous ruling that the plaintiff does have standing to sue.

The first, fifth and sixth special defenses filed by Burton and Norma Firtel and Adco are the same, and it is to these special defenses that the plaintiff's motion to strike is directed. The defendants' first special defense is that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring suit on behalf of Barbur.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> The second special defense is that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action derivatively because he failed to make a demand on the Board of Directors of Adco, in violation of General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-722</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> The sixth special defense is that in pursuing this action derivatively on behalf of Adco and on behalf of himself and Barbur, the plaintiff is engaged in an irreconcilable conflict of interest and lacks standing to sue.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

A review of the pleadings reveals that the Adco and the Firtel defendants filed motions to dismiss dated November 25, 2005 and December 2, 2005, respectively. In their motions to dismiss the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, dated October 17, 2005, and each accompanying memorandum of law in support of their motions to dismiss, the defendants raised the same issues of standing as contained in their first, fifth and sixth special defenses to the Third Amended Complaint. The defendants' arguments regarding the plaintiff's lack of standing were rejected by the order of the court (Gilardi, J.) on January 3, 2006, when the motions to dismiss were denied. The plaintiff argues that the law of the case doctrine bars the first, fifth and sixth special defenses. The defendants, by raising the question of standing once again, are asking this court to revisit the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.

"Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion . . . and implicates this court's subject matter jurisdiction . . . A party cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy . . . The burden rests with the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor . . . clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute."

TK Auto Wholesalers,</italic><cross_reference>98 Conn.App. 533</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>537-38</cross_reference> (2006)."The question of standing does not involve an inquiry into the merits of the case . . . It merely requires allegations of a colorable claim of injury to an interest that is arguably protected by [a] statute or common law." (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic> at 538.

"Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it . . . A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain to action before it . . . Once it is determined that a tribunal has authority or competence to decide the class of cases to which the action belongs, the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is resolved in favor of entertaining the action . . .

The plaintiff argues that the defendants have twice unsuccessfully argued that the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this action. The first challenge to the plaintiff's standing was made by the defendant Adco in a motion to dismiss dated May 10, 2005, in an action brought by Saunders on behalf of Barbur against Adco in the New Haven Housing Court. That action has since been consolidated with the instant action. In that motion to dismiss, Adco argued that Saunders did not have standing to sue on behalf of Barbur. On June 3, 2005, the court (Skolnick, J.) entered an order denying that motion to dismiss, holding that Saunders is an appropriate party to bring suit in behalf of Barbur.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

The second challenge to the plaintiff's standing was made by the defendants Burton and Norma Firtel and Adco in separate motions to dismiss dated December 2, 2005 and November 22, 2005, respectively, which were filed in the instant case. In those motions, the defendants argued that Saunders did not have standing to sue in behalf of Adco. The defendants' challenge was based on the arguments that: (1) the "many hats" that Saunders was alleged to be wearing, as he was representing the interests of Adco, Barbur and himself; (2) the alleged conflict Saunders had in pursuing the derivative claims and the individual claims; and (3) the fact that Saunders had failed to make a demand on Adco prior to bringing the derivative action. After oral argument, the court (Gilardi, J.) entered an order dated January 3, 2006, denying the motion to dismiss, thus holding, that Saunders had adequate standing.

The law of the case doctrine provides that "[w]here a matter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily, the court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may treat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the opinion that the issue was correctly decided, in the absence of some new or overriding circumstance." <italic>Forte v. Citicorp</italic><italic>Mortgage,</italic> <cross_reference>66 Conn.App. 475</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>480-81</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>784 A.2d 1024</cross_reference> (2001); quoting<italic>Breen v. Phelps</italic>, <cross_reference>186 Conn. 86</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>99</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>439 A.2d 1066</cross_reference> (1982). "A judge is not bound to follow the decisions of another judge made at an earlier stage of the proceedings, and if the same point is again raised he has the same right to reconsider the question as if he had himself made the original decision . . . According to the generally accepted view, one judge may, in a proper case, vacate, modify, or depart from an interlocutory order or ruling of another judge in the same case, upon a question of law."

CT Page 23464 "New pleadings intended to raise again a question of law which has been already presented on the record and determined adversely to the pleader are not to be favored . . . But a determination so made is not necessarily to be treated as an infallible guide to the court in dealing with all matters subsequently arising in the cause. (Internal citations omitted.) <italic>Breen v. Phelps,</italic> <italic>supra</italic>, <cross_reference>186 Conn. 97-101</cross_reference>.

This court has reviewed the motions to dismiss filed by each of the defendants in this matter, as well as, each memorandum of law filed in support of said motions. The court has also reviewed the plaintiff's objection to the motions to dismiss and his memorandum of law. The defendants rely mainly on the case of <italic>Barrett v. Southern Conn. Gas</italic><italic>Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>172 Conn. 362</cross_reference> (1977), while the plaintiff relies mainly on <italic>Fink v.</italic><italic>Golenbock</italic>, <cross_reference>238 Conn. 183</cross_reference> (1996).<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> Each of the parties thoroughly sets forth the respective arguments and positions for the court's consideration. This court has undertaken this review due to the absence of a formal memorandum of decision on January 3, 2006 by the court (Gilardi, J.) and by the court (June 3, 2005, Skolnick, J.) in the consolidated housing session matter. This court finds no reason to disturb the decisions of those courts which denied the motions to dismiss, as those rulings are not clearly erroneous. Those courts found that the plaintiff had standing to bring the actions and that the lack of a written demand pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-722</cross_reference><footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> was not fatal to the plaintiff's cause.

Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, the plaintiff's motion to strike is granted. The first, fifth and sixth special defenses filed by each of the named defendants are hereby ordered stricken.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The original action bearing a return date of April 19, 2005, named Barry Saunders as the sole plaintiff and Burton Firtel, Norma Firtel and Adco Medical Supplies, Inc. as defendants. On November 1, 2005, the court (Ford, JTR) granted the Plaintiff's Motion to Add Parties Plaintiff. The plaintiffs are now Barry Saunders, both individually, and on behalf of Adco Medical Supplies, Inc., d/b/a Adco Corporation and Barbur Associates, LLC.</footnote_body>
