</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The petitioner, Tyrone Montgomery, alleges in his petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus initially filed on February 3, 1999 and amended on February 11, 2003, that his 1997 convictions for one count of felony murder in violation of GGS § <cross_reference>53a-54c</cross_reference>, and one count of murder in violation of CGS § <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference>, and one count of assault in the third degree in violation of CGS § <cross_reference>53a-61</cross_reference> were obtained in violation of the<cross_reference>Sixth</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution</cross_reference> and Article <cross_reference>I</cross_reference>, Section <cross_reference>8</cross_reference> of the Constitution of the state of Connecticut. He specifically claims to have been deprived of the effective assistance of trial defense counsel in that his counsel: failed to conduct an adequate investigation, failed to pursue a psychiatric evaluation for him, failed to investigate potential defenses, failed to preserve the petitioner's right to remain silent, failed to prepare for sentencing, and failed to seek to withdraw his representation after the attorney/client relationship broke down. In addition, the petitioner alleges that there was a conflict of interest between his trial defense counsel and himself.

This matter came on for trial before this Court on May 2, 2003 and again on May 29, 2003 at which time testimony was received from the petitioner, and his trial defense counsel, Attorney Stephen Cashman. The transcript of the petitioner's trial, six volumes in all, was considered as part of the expanded record.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> As is explained in greater detail hereafter, this Court finds that the petitioner has failed in meeting his burden of proof and the petition shall be denied.

The Court has reviewed all of the testimony and evidence and makes the following findings of fact (further facts will be related as necessary to resolve specific claims).

Findings of Fact CT Page 8004

1. The petitioner was the defendant in a case in the Judicial District of Hartford, under Docket Number CR96-1495307 entitled <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Montgomery</italic>. The petitioner was charged with one count of felony murder in violation of GGS § <cross_reference>53a-54c</cross_reference>, one count of murder in violation of GGS § <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference> (a), and one count of attempted murder in violation of CGS §§ <cross_reference>53a-49</cross_reference> (a) (2) and <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference> (a).

2. He was represented throughout these proceedings by Attorney Stephen Cashman and Attorney Sonje Wilkerson.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

3. The case was thereafter tried to a jury of twelve that, on October 1, 1997, returned a verdict of guilty as to murder and felony murder and not guilty as to attempted murder.

4. The jury reasonably could have found the following facts to be true regarding the underlying offenses. The victim, Gayle I., resided in Manchester with her husband, Douglas. The victim was employed by a local Wal-Mart store, where she worked in the shoe department. On April 30, 1996, the victim worked the evening shift. The victim's husband expected the victim to return home from work at approximately 10:15 p.m. that evening.

5. At about 10:50 p.m., the victim drove her Jeep Cherokee (Jeep) hurriedly into her driveway. The petitioner followed her into the driveway in his white Mitsubishi Mirage. The petitioner, who worked with the victim in the Wal-Mart shoe department, exited his car and approached the victim's Jeep, carrying a twenty-two-caliber Norinco rifle. The victim activated the automatic garage door and sounded her car horn for several seconds. The petitioner then fired seven shots at the victim, five of which struck her in the head, three from very close range. The victim also suffered defensive gunshot wounds to her left hand.

6. After hearing the car horn and the gunshots, the victim's husband looked outside and saw the petitioner standing next to the driver's side of the victim's car. The victim's husband immediately ran back inside to call 911. In the meantime, the petitioner ran to his car, entered it and sped off. The victim's husband then went outside, where he found the victim unresponsive and slumped across the front seat of her Jeep. The victim died at the scene as a result of the bullet wounds to her head.

7. The petitioner's parents hired Attorney Cashman to represent the petitioner at his murder trial. This was prior to the issuance of an arrest warrant for the petitioner.

8. Attorney Cashman had been engaged in the practice of law in CT Page 8005 Connecticut since 1982.

9. The first time that Attorney Cashman met with the petitioner was at the Whiting Forensic Institute where the petitioner was being treated.

10. It was at this meeting that the petitioner first told his attorney that he had been the person who shot Ms. I.

11. Attorney Cashman determined that the best possible defense for his client would be to pursue an insanity defense or argue that there was an extreme emotional disturbance. Notwithstanding, the petitioner refused all of Attorney Cashman's requests to undergo psychiatric examination.

12. Additional facts shall be discussed as necessary.

Discussion of Law

It is important at the outset to understand a critical difference between the legal status of a person who has been accused of a crime as opposed to one who has been convicted of a crime. While the person who has been accused of a crime is entitled to a presumption of his or her innocence, the petitioner in a habeas corpus petition is not. "It is undoubtedly true that `[a] person when first charged with a crime is entitled to a presumption of innocence, and may insist that his guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt. <italic>In re Winship</italic>, <cross_reference>397 U.S. 385</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>90 S.Ct 1068</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>25 L.Ed.2d 368</cross_reference> (1970).' <italic>Herrera v. Collins</italic>, <cross_reference>506 U.S. 390</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>113 S.Ct. 853</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>859</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>122 L.Ed.2d 203</cross_reference> (1993) . . . The presumption of innocence, however, does not outlast the judgment of conviction at trial . . . Thus, in the eyes of the law, [the] petitioner does not come before the Court as one who is `innocent,' but on the contrary as one who has been convicted by due process of law." <italic>Summerville v. Warden</italic>, <cross_reference>229 Conn. 397</cross_reference>
at <cross_reference>422-23</cross_reference> (1994).

Count I: Deprivation of Effective Assistance of Counsel

In order to prevail on the issue of whether there has been ineffective representation by the petitioner's trial defense counsel,<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> the petitioner must satisfy <italic>both</italic> prongs of the test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <italic>Strickland v. Washington</italic>, <cross_reference>466 U.S. 688</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>404 S.Ct. 2052</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>80 L.Ed.2d 674</cross_reference>, reh. denied, <cross_reference>467 U.S. 1267</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104 S.Ct. 3562</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>82 L.Ed.2d (1984</cross_reference>), before the Court can grant relief. Specifically, the petitioner must <italic>first</italic> show "that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the `counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the<cross_reference>Sixth Amendment</cross_reference>." <italic>Strickland</italic>, <italic>infra</italic> at 687. If and only if the petitioner CT Page 8006 manages to get over the first hurdle, then the petitioner must clear the second obstacle by proving "that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable." <italic>Strickland</italic>, <italic>infra</italic> at 687. In short, the petitioner must show both deficiency and prejudice. A failure to prove both, even though counsel's trial performance may have been substandard, will result in denial of the petition.

Trial in this Court of a habeas petition is not an opportunity for a new counsel to attempt to re-litigate a case in a different manner. It is indisputable fact that many times if one had foreknowledge of certain events, different courses might well have been taken. Likewise, a habeas court knowing the outcome of the trial "may not indulge in hindsight to reconstruct the circumstances surrounding the challenged conduct, but must evaluate the acts or omissions from trial counsel's perspective at the time of trial." <italic>Beasley v. Commissioner of Corrections,</italic><cross_reference>47 Conn. App. 253</cross_reference> at <cross_reference>264</cross_reference> (1979), cert. den., <cross_reference>243 Conn. 967</cross_reference> (1998). "A fair assessment of an attorney's performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances to counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance." <italic>Henry v. Commissioner of</italic><italic>Correction</italic>, <cross_reference>60 Conn. App. 313</cross_reference> at <cross_reference>317</cross_reference> (2000).

It is not necessary to consider whether a trial counsel's performance was deficient if the habeas Court is satisfied that there was no prejudice to the defendant by the actions of the trial counsel in representing the petitioner. "A reviewing court can find against a petitioner on either ground, whichever is easier. <italic>Strickland v.</italic><italic>Washington</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, 697; see <italic>Nardini v. Manson</italic>, <cross_reference>207 Conn. 118</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>124</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>540 A.2d 69</cross_reference> (1988) ('[a] court deciding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim need not address the question of counsel's performance, if it is easier to dispose of the claim on the ground of insufficient prejudice')." <italic>Valeriano v. Bronson</italic>, <cross_reference>209 Conn. 75</cross_reference> at <cross_reference>86</cross_reference> (1988).

In the instant case, the petitioner complains that his trial defense counsel did not investigate and raise potential defenses. In this regard, it would appear as if the petitioner is now seeking to allege that he was not the murderer and, in fact, had an alibi for the evening of the murders. At the habeas trial, the petitioner tells a story that CT Page 8007 has him going home after work and receiving a telephone from an Anthony Cortes. According to the petitioner's habeas testimony, Mr. Cortes arranged to meet the petitioner at the parking lot for the Buckland Hills Mall in Manchester. After sitting in the car talking for a few hours, the petitioner testified that he and Cortes left the parking lot, in Cortes' vehicle, to go and meet someone. While the petitioner was following Cortes, he testified that he saw Cortes attempt to run Gayle's jeep off the road. They then followed her to her home at which point Cortes was alleged to have said "it was going down. "<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> The petitioner stated that Cortes went up to her jeep and shot her. Thereafter, the petitioner stated that Cortes drove the petitioner back to his car and the petitioner went to West Hartford to get something to drink. About one hour after the shooting, he checked himself into the Saint Francis Hospital to deal with "some personal issues." The petitioner does admit to purchasing the gun used to murder Ms I. because Cortes asked him to get him a gun for a robbery, although he was alleged to have said that he would not hurt the victim.

The story told by the petitioner at his habeas trial stands in stark contrast with the version of events as reported by Attorney Cashman. First off, Attorney Cashman has testified that the petitioner had admitted to him that he was, in fact, the murderer. These admissions, made within the confines of the attorney/client relationship, remained concealed until the petitioner filed his habeas petition challenging the performance of his trial defense counsel.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> At that point, Attorney Cashman was permitted to testify to the admissions made to him by the petitioner. It is clear that the petitioner told his attorney that he, not Cortes, was the person who committed the murder. Attorney Cashman did have access to and had read the police reports surrounding the incident. He testified at the habeas trial that the police investigation was thorough and that it corroborated what his client was telling him. Attorney Cashman was then in the position of having heard his client admit to the crime and having corroborating evidence to show that his client had, in fact, committed the murder. This would have severely limited the options of Attorney Cashman in seeking to raise a defense for the petitioner.

Now in the habeas trial, this Court is confronted with two radically different versions of this critical conversation between attorney and client. It is obvious that either the petitioner or his trial defense counsel is attempting to deceive this Court. In evaluating the credibility of the testimony, it is important to remember the relative position of each of these witnesses. The petitioner has been convicted of serious crimes and is currently serving a lengthy prison term. His trial defense counsel is engaged in the practice of law for a living. If the CT Page 8008 petitioner is to be believed, then he may stand to gain his freedom. If the trial defense counsel is believed, he stands to gain nothing. There is a strong incentive to fabricate on the part of the petitioner while his trial defense counsel would have no such incentive. Indeed, there is a strong deterrent for the trial defense counsel to lie for if he were to be caught perpetrating an act of fraud upon this Court, he could, perhaps, face a prosecution for perjury and the loss of his own freedom. At a minimum, being caught in an attempt to defraud the Court would lead to sanctions and quite possibly a loss of his license to practice law. There is no such deterrent for the petitioner. He is already serving a lengthy prison sentence of sixty-five years: He is likely to spend the remainder of his life in confinement so the threat of an additional five years for an act of perjury would be little deterrent. Moreover, while the petitioner did not testify at his trial on the merits, he did essentially admit to the crime when he chose to exercise his right to allocution at sentencing and offered the following to the sentencing judge:

The Defendant: I would like to say, my parents, my family, I thank them and I love them unconditionally. And to [the prosecutor] <italic>this isn't the</italic><italic>best I can do</italic>. <italic>Next time, I'll do better.</italic> And to everyone involved in this case against me, at some point, we will meet again. You will not stop a juggernaut. The Apocalypse has spoken.

(Emphasis added.)<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

In light of all of the above, this Court concludes that it is Attorney Cashman's account of what he was told that is entitled to the greater credibility.

Given that his client had admitted being the person who shot and killed the victim, there were major limitations upon what defenses the trial defense counsel could raise. Any attempt to raise an alibi defense would be totally inappropriate.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> Likewise, given the circumstances in which this crime was perpetrated, it is most unlikely that a defense of self-defense was available. In light of his client's admissions, Attorney Cashman would have been unable to present any evidence pointing the blame for the murder in the direction of another person (specifically Mr. Cortes). In fact, it is clear to this Court that Attorney Cashman was correct when he identified the best course of action available to him to represent the petitioner was through raising an insanity defense. It was the petitioner himself who prevented this defense from being raised. Despite a request by his trial defense counsel that he undergo psychiatric evaluation, the petitioner adamantly refused stating that "I don't want anybody getting into my head." The refusal of his client to CT Page 8009 cooperate in this course of defense eliminated an insanity defense.

The petitioner also asserts that his trial defense counsel failed to protect his constitutional right to silence through properly raised objections to the testimony of Detective Paul Lombardo. The issue has already been dealt with in the direct appeal of the petitioner's case. "The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to introduce evidence of his refusal to continue answering questions posed to him by the police prior to his arrest, but after he had been advised of his <italic>Miranda</italic> rights. The defendant contends that this impropriety constituted a violation of his rights under the <cross_reference>fifth</cross_reference> and<cross_reference>fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution</cross_reference> and, further, that the error was harmful, thereby entitling him to a new trial. Although we agree with the defendant that the state should not have been permitted to elicit testimony regarding his termination of the police interview, we nevertheless conclude that he is not entitled to a new trial because the <italic>impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt</italic>." (Emphasis added.) <italic>State v. Montgomery</italic>, <cross_reference>254 Conn. 694</cross_reference> at <cross_reference>710-11</cross_reference> (2000). Thus, it is the law of this case that this testimony, even though improperly elicited and even though there may not have been an objection by the trial defense counsel, was harmless error. Consequently, the petitioner cannot have suffered any prejudice by any failure of his trial defense counsel to his constitutional right to silence. Given that, the petitioner fails to meet his burden under the <italic>Strickland</italic> standard of showing ineffective assistance of counsel and the petition must be denied.

Counts II and III: Conflict of Interest Claims

Both of the petitioner's claims in Count II and Count III essentially claim the same thing.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> Namely, the petitioner alleges that there was a conflict of interest between the petitioner and his trial defense counsel. A criminal defendant is entitled to conflict-free counsel, <italic>Wood</italic><italic>v. Georgia,</italic> <cross_reference>450 U.S. 261</cross_reference> (1981), and the failure to provide that is one of the best grounds upon which a court may grant a habeas corpus petition. It is, however, instructive to consider what constitutes a conflict of interest in the first place. Simply because a petitioner chooses to label a dispute with counsel as a conflict of interest does not make it so.

The burden of proving a conflict of interest rests with the petitioner. "We have described an attorney's conflict of interest as that which impedes his duty of loyalty to his client . . . Thus, an attorney may be considered to be laboring under an impaired duty of loyalty, and thereby be subject to conflicting interests, because of interests or CT Page 8010 factors personal to him that are inconsistent, diverse or otherwise discordant with [the interests] of his client . . ." (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>State v. Crespo, supra</italic>, <cross_reference>246 Conn. 655</cross_reference>
at <cross_reference>689-90</cross_reference>; <italic>Phillips v. Warden</italic>, <cross_reference>220 Conn. 112</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>139</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>595 A.2d 1356</cross_reference> (1991). Rule 1.7(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct state that "a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer's own interests." A conflict of interest will be found to exist, for example: where a lawyer is actively representing another party who has interests adverse to the client; where the lawyer's personal safety or financial interests will be adversely impacted by continued representation of the client; and where another client has financial interests that would be adversely affected by the representation of this client. None of those situations exist in this case.

The closest thing to proof of a conflict of interest in this case may lie in the refusal of the trial defense counsel to undertake the presentation of false and misleading testimony and the subsequent disagreement with the client over the course to take. Misleading a Court, of course, is something that no attorney, who believes in the meaning of his or her oath of office would ever undertake. The petitioner states that the entry of an appearance by Attorney Wilkerson should have been enough to show Attorney Cashman that there was a conflict of interest. It is reasonable to expect that if the petitioner admitted to Attorney Wilkerson the same facts he did to Attorney Cashman that she would have taken the same course. Consequently, it is a totally disingenuous assertion for a petitioner to argue that the attorney to whom he told the truth was ineffective by failing to present a specious and perjurious defense. It is likely that Attorney Cashman's refusal to mislead the Court may have angered the petitioner. Moreover, it may even be accurate to state that there was a "conflict of interest" between the petitioner's interest in presenting a false defense and the attorney's interest in fulfilling his duty to the Court as an officer of the Court. However, in order for a genuine conflict of interest to be found such that the petitioner would be entitled to relief in a habeas corpus proceeding, the interest of the petitioner must be a legitimate interest. No person has the right to demand that his counsel, guaranteed him under the <cross_reference>Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution</cross_reference>, be a counsel who is willing to violate the Professional Rules of Conduct and laws of the jurisdiction.

In reviewing the record of trial, it is clear that Attorney Cashman did an outstanding job of representing his client's interests, <italic>within the</italic><italic>bounds of that permitted by the law and the Rules of Professional</italic><italic>CT Page 8011</italic><italic>Conduct</italic>. Attorneys Cashman and Wilkerson worked together in this case and there is no evidence of any sort of conflict of interest such that the petitioner is now entitled to relief in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus.

Accordingly, the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus is denied.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> This Court notes that there were two counsel who had appearances in the case. The petitioner is challenging the representation by Attorney Cashman. He makes no allegation that Attorney Wilkerson failed to provide anything less than appropriate representation. Given that the petitioner is challenging his trial representation, his failure to make any claims in this petition as to the actions, or inactions, of Attorney Wilkerson will bar him in the future from filing another habeas petition that challenges her actions.
