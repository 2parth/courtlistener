</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This is a personal injury lawsuit in which the plaintiff, Margaret Feehan, alleges that she fell due to a hole in the parking area of the defendant's restaurant located at the Interstate 95 service plaza in Milford. The complaint is in three counts. The first count alleges negligence; the second count alleges recklessness; and the third count alleges public nuisance. The defendant has moved to strike the second and third counts. For the reasons set forth below, the motion to strike the second count (recklessness) is granted and the motion to strike the third count (public nuisance) is denied.

<center>                               BACKGROUND</center>
In the first count, the plaintiff alleges seventeen specifications of negligence. Essentially the plaintiff asserts that the defendant allowed, permitted or caused a defective and dangerous condition to exist in its parking lot and further that the defendant knew or should have known that the parking area was in such dangerous condition but it did not correct the condition to make it safe for invitees like the plaintiff. In her recklessness count, the plaintiff realleges the specifications of negligence in the first count with the additional allegation that the defendant knew that its parking lot was in a dangerous condition and refused to repair or remedy the conditions in reckless disregard of the rights and safety of others and the consequences of its actions.

In the public nuisance count, the plaintiff alleges that (1) the defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition of the premises but it failed to remedy or repair the condition; (2) the condition was inherently dangerous, had a CT Page 486 natural tendency to cause injuries, was continuing and amounted to nuisance, and (3) the plaintiff was in the exercise of a public right as a traveler on Interstate 95 to use the public restrooms on defendant's premises.

<center>                               DISCUSSION</center>
The purpose of a motion to strike is to test the legal sufficiency of the allegations of a complaint to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>10-39</cross_reference>;<italic>Peter-Michael, Inc. v. Sea Shell Associates</italic>, <cross_reference>244 Conn. 269</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>270</cross_reference>
(1998). For purpose of a motion to strike, the moving party admits all facts well pleaded. <italic>RK Constructors, Inc. v. Fusco</italic><italic>Corp.</italic>, <cross_reference>231 Conn. 381</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>383</cross_reference> n. 2 (1994). The court must construe the facts in the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff.<italic>Faulkner v. United Technologies</italic>, <cross_reference>240 Conn. 576</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>580</cross_reference> (1997).

The defendant asserts that the allegations in the second count are insufficient to state a claim for relief based on recklessness. The plaintiff argues that by alleging that the defendant knew of the dangerous defect and refused to remedy it, she had adequately pleaded a cause of action for reckless conduct.

There is a wide difference between negligence and reckless or wanton misconduct. <italic>Sheiman v. Lafayette Bank  Trust Co.</italic>,<cross_reference>4 Conn. App. 39</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>45</cross_reference> (1985). The mere use of the word "reckless" is insufficient to raise an actionable claim of reckless or wanton misconduct. <italic>Kostiuk v. Queally</italic>, <cross_reference>159 Conn. 91</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>94</cross_reference> (1970). Likewise, injecting the words "intentionally" or "knowingly" do not, alone, constitute additional factual allegations sufficient to transform negligent conduct into reckless conduct. <italic>Brown v.</italic><italic>Branford</italic>, <cross_reference>12 Conn. App. 106</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>110</cross_reference> (1987).

In <italic>Dubay v. Irish</italic>, <cross_reference>207 Conn. 518</cross_reference> (1988), our Supreme Court described recklessness as follows:<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

<block_quote>  Reckless is a state of consciousness with reference to the consequences of one's acts. (Citation omitted.) . . . It is more than negligence, more than gross negligence. (Citation omitted.) The state of CT Page 487 mind amounting to recklessness may be inferred from conduct. But, in order to infer it, there must be something more than a failure to exercise a reasonable degree of watchfulness to avoid danger to others or to take reasonable precautions to avoid injury to them. (Citation omitted.) Wanton conduct is reckless conduct. (Citation omitted.) It is such conduct as indicates a reckless disregard of the just rights or safety of others or of the consequences of the action. (Citations omitted.) Wilful misconduct has been defined as intenational conduct designed to injure for which there is no just cause or excuse. (Citation omitted.) Its characteristic element is the design to injure either actually entertained or to be implied from the conduct and circumstances. (Citation omitted.) Not only the action producing the injury but the resulting injury also must be intentional. (Citation omitted.)</block_quote>

In the present case, the plaintiff's recklessness allegation is that the defendant knew that there was a hole in its parking lot that created a dangerous condition and refused to repair it. There is no allegation that the defendant intended to cause harm. Nor can this allegation be construed as alleging "highly unreasonable conduct, involving an extreme departure from ordinary care, in such a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent." W. Prosser  W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed.) ยง 34, p. 214.

Even construing the second count most favorably to the plaintiff, it is insufficient to state a recklessness cause of action. Accordingly, the motion to strike the second count must be granted.

<center>                                   B.</center><center>                             PUBLIC NUISANCE</center>
The defendant asserts that the allegations in the third count are insufficient because it does not adequately plead the elements of public nuisance described by our Supreme Court in<italic>Pestey v. Cushman</italic>, <cross_reference>259 Conn. 345</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>355-57</cross_reference> (2002).

Section 821B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a public nuisance as "an unreasonable interference with a right CT Page 488 common to the general public." In Connecticut, to establish a public nuisance claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) the condition complained of had a natural tendency to create danger and inflict injury on person or property; (2) the danger created was a continuing one; (3) the use of the land was unreasonable or unlawful; and (4) the existence of the nuisance was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. <italic>Pestey v. Cushman</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>,<cross_reference>259 Conn. 355</cross_reference>; <italic>State v. Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton</italic>,<cross_reference>204 Conn. 177</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>183</cross_reference> (1987).

The defendant argues that the nuisance count is defective because there is no explicit allegation that the use of the land was unreasonable or unlawful, or that the nuisance was the cause of plaintiff's injury. This claim is unpersuasive. In construing a complaint for purposes of a motion to strike, what is necessarily implied in an allegation need not be expressly alleged. <italic>Lombard v. Edward J. Peters, Jr., P.C.</italic>, <cross_reference>252 Conn. 623</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>626</cross_reference> (2000). From this perspective, the complaint adequately pleads a cause of action for public nuisance. Accordingly the motion to strike the third count must be denied.

<center>                               CONCLUSION</center>
For the reasons set forth above, the motion to strike the second count is granted and the motion to strike the third count is denied.

So Ordered at New Haven, Connecticut this 8th day of January 2004.

DEVLIN, JUDGE.
