The case proceeded to trial and defendant did not appear. Defendant's counsel appeared. Counsel represented both parties.

<center>                               <italic>II. ISSUES</italic></center>
What should be the amount of the child support award? Should the court allow visitation if defendant refuses to provide plaintiff with his Nevada and Hawaii residential addresses?

<center>                         <italic>III. STATEMENT OF FACTS</italic></center>
The court finds the following facts proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The parties married on August 31, 2000 in Maui, Hawaii. Plaintiff had resided at least one year in Connecticut before bringing the instant action.

Plaintiff is a home health care aide. Her gross weekly income is $ 330.00 and her net weekly income is $ 310.00. Defendant is a physician. He works part-time as an emergency room physician in Hawaii. He claims a gross weekly income of $ 813.00 and a net weekly income of $ 532.00. Defendant depleted plaintiff's $ 26,000.00 share of their joint savings account.

Defendant was employed at Lawrence  Memorial Hospital as an emergency room physician for about five years before resigning his position. He earned about $ 225,000.00 per year at Lawrence  Memorial Hospital. He is licensed to practice medicine in Connecticut, Hawaii, Nevada and California.

The parties have one minor child, age 5. He is covered by the Husky program and is a recipient of food stamps. CT Page 6779

Defendant refuses to provide his current address in Nevada to plaintiff. Plaintiff has allowed the minor child to visit defendant in Nevada, but is uneasy about allowing the visitation to continue. Plaintiff does not know defendant's residential address in Nevada. She does not know if the defendant lives alone nor is she aware of the conditions of the residence in which defendant lives. She believes the defendant also has a residence in Hawaii. If the defendant were to provide plaintiff with permanent residential addresses in Nevada and in Hawaii, the plaintiff would allow the minor child to visit the defendant for as many as two months during the summer.

<center>                          <italic>IV. PRINCIPLES OF LAW</italic></center>
Connecticut General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>46b-56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>46b-56c</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>46b-61</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>46b-62</cross_reference>, and<cross_reference>46b-84</cross_reference>.

<center>                               <italic>V. ANALYSIS</italic></center>
The minor child's visits with the defendant require thousands of miles of travel. It is reasonable for the plaintiff to want to know the address at which she may find the child, the conditions of the residence, with whom the defendant may be living and the nature of the activities in which the child will be engaged. It is not in the best interests of the child for the defendant to exercise out-of-state residential visitation at undisclosed locations.

Defendant is licensed to practice medicine in four states. Defendant failed to introduce evidence of his inability to secure full-time employment as an emergency room physician. Defendant has earned as much as $ 225,000.00 per year in Connecticut as an emergency room physician. Lawrence  Memorial Hospital did not terminate him and he presented no evidence that his licenses to practice in the other three states are subject to restrictions. The court therefore imputes to him an earning capacity of $ 175,00.00.

<center>                 <italic>VI. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW/JUDGMENT/ORDERS</italic></center>
The court has jurisdiction. The marriage has broken down irretrievably and there is no hope of reconciliation. Therefore, the marriage is dissolved.

<center>                                 <italic>CUSTODY</italic></center>
Plaintiff and the defendant shall enjoy joint legal custody of the CT Page 6780 minor child. Plaintiff shall have primary physical custody subject to reasonable rights of visitation for the defendant. Such visitation will not proceed until the defendant provides plaintiff with a residential address and telephone number for himself in Nevada and a residential address and telephone for himself in Hawaii. If defendant does not have residential address in Hawaii, he shall provide the address of a suitable temporary address where he will exercise visitation.

<center>                              <italic>CHILD SUPPORT</italic></center>
Defendant shall pay $ 325.00 per week in child support. The defendant shall also pay 50% of all unreimbursed and uncovered medical expenses for the minor child. The court has deviated from the presumptive amount in consideration of the significant visitation travel expenses the defendant shall incur in paying for air travel between Connecticut and Nevada and between Connecticut and Hawaii.

<center>                               <italic>VISITATION</italic></center>
Defendant shall enjoy reasonable rights of visitation subject to the provisions in the custody order.

<center>                        <italic>EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT ORDER</italic></center>
The court shall retain jurisdiction over the post-secondary, college educational expenses of the minor child.

<center>                            <italic>MEDICAL INSURANCE</italic></center>
Defendant shall maintain health insurance coverage for the minor child as is available through his employment at reasonable cost.

<center>                             <italic>LIFE INSURANCE</italic></center>
Defendant shall maintain a life insurance policy in the amount of $ 250,000.00 naming plaintiff as the trustee for the minor child and the minor child as beneficiary. Defendant shall maintain such policy during the period in which he is ordered to pay child support.

<center>                                  <italic>DEBTS</italic></center>
Each party is responsible for the debts listed on their respective financial affidavits and shall hold each other harmless on those debts.

<center>                             <italic>ATTORNEYS FEES</italic>
CT Page 6781</center>
Each party shall be responsible for his own attorneys fees.
