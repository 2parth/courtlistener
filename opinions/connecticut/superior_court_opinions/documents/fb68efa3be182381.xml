This case involves an amalgam of claims arising from injuries that the plaintiff, Kevin Dutton, allegedly suffered while he was installing a furnace on the premises of a property in New Haven in the course of his employment with Comfort Zone, Inc. (Comfort Zone). In his revised complaint dated June 3, 2011, the plaintiff alleges that when he was installing the furnace on July 30, 2009, he was electrocuted and suffered serious injuries when a live wire fell from the ceiling. In two separate counts the plaintiff alleges that such injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant Elizabeth Adams, who had hired Dutton to install the furnace, as well as the negligence of Three Gates Condominium Association, the registered owner of the property. Comfort Zone intervened in the action as a plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes ยง<cross_reference>31-293</cross_reference> seeking reimbursement for any moneys it has paid, and will be obligated to pay, to Dutton under the Workers' Compensation Act.

Each defendant brought a crossclaim against Comfort Zone in which they seek indemnity and/or contribution on the theory that the negligence of Comfort Zone was responsible for Dutton's injuries. Adams filed her crossclaim on June 8, 2010. More specifically, Adams alleges that if Dutton was injured as he alleges in his complaint, his damages were caused by the negligence and carelessness of Comfort Zone, and not the negligence of Adams that it failed to properly train and supervise Dutton, that they sent an inexperienced worker to perform the installation, that it knew or should have known that Dutton lacked the requisite knowledge and experience to perform the job and was therefore not qualified, and it failed to shut off the electricity in the area that Dutton was working, or to ask Adams to do so.

Adams also alleges that Comfort Zone was in control of the installation of the furnace to the exclusion of Adams, and its negligence was the direct and immediate cause of the plaintiff's alleged injuries. Also, CT Page 20477 Adams alleges that she did not know of, and had no reason to anticipate the negligence of Comfort Zone and could reasonably rely upon Comfort Zone Inc. to act in a non-negligent manner while carrying out its duties.

On June 7, 2011, Comfort Zone filed motions to strike both cross claims on the ground that both claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Adams filed an objection to the motion on June 30, 2011. These matters were heard on short calendar on August 1, 2011.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

Comfort Zone argues that the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act bar an indemnification claim against an employer whose employee who was injured while performing work for that employer.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
Comfort Zone acknowledges that a major exception to the remedial exclusivity of the Act comes into play when a party alleges that it had an independent legal relationship with the employer. Comfort Zone contends that Adams was required to plead facts relating to the existence of an independent legal duty between it and Adams in order for her cross claim of contribution to come within this exception, and that since she did not do so, her cross claim must be stricken.

In response, Adams argues that "independent legal relationships" can be express or implied, and that implied legal duties would also serve to preclude the operation of the exclusive remedy provisions of the Act. Additionally, she points to precedent from our Supreme Court that suggests that a contractor's obligation to perform work CT Page 20478 with due care gives rise to such an independent legal relationship, and since Comfort Zone had such an obligation, she may be entitled to contribution from Comfort Zone.

Comfort Zone then filed a reply memorandum, in which it argues that more than an allegation that Comfort Zone was negligent is required to survive a motion to strike, and that Adams' "implied legal relationship" argument is unpersuasive.

"Under the Workers' Compensation Act, both the employer and the employee have relinquished certain rights to obtain other advantages. The employee no longer has to prove negligence on the part of the employer, but, in return, he has to accept a limited, although certain, recovery . . . The employer, in turn, guarantees compensation to an injured employee in return for the exclusivity of the workers' compensation liability to its employees . . . Because of the importance of the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, [the] court has limited a third-party's right to seek indemnification from an employer to those situations where there is an independent legal relationship between the third party and the employer, thereby generating a legal duty from the employer to the third party seeking indemnification." (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Barry v. Quality Steel Products, Inc.</italic>,<cross_reference>263 Conn. 424</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>451</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>820 A.2d 258</cross_reference> (2003).

"When the third party, in a suit by the employee, seeks recovery over against a contributorily negligent employer, contribution [or indemnification] is ordinarily denied on the ground that the employer cannot be said to be jointly liable in tort to the employee because of the operation of the exclusive-remedy clause. But if the employer can be said to have breached an independent duty toward the third party, or if there is a basis for finding an implied promise of indemnity, recovery in the form of indemnity may be allowed. The right to indemnity is clear when the obligation springs from a separate contractual relation, such as . . . a contractor's obligation to perform his work with due care; but when the indemnity claim rests upon the theory that a `primary' wrongdoer impliedly promises to indemnify a `secondary' wrongdoer, the great majority of jurisdictions disallow this claim."

Groton</italic> <cross_reference>212 Conn. 138</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>144-45</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>561 A.2d 434</cross_reference> (1989).

Because Adams does not argue that she expressly alleged the existence of an independent legal duty, the central issue in deciding this motion to strike is whether an implied legal duty was created in Comfort Zone by the nature of its obligation to install the furnace in a workmanlike manner. The above-quoted language from <italic>Ferryman</italic> could be read to support such a conclusion. The Superior Court, however, is split on this issue. A CT Page 20479 minority of cases support Adams' argument all that is required for the existence of an independent legal relationship is an implied agreement by an employer-contractor to perform in a workmanlike manner. See <italic>Rodriguez</italic><italic>v. 1255 West Broad Street LLC</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford at Hartford, Docket No. 08 5020088 (December 8, 2009, Rittenband, J.) (denying employer's motion to strike because "under<italic>Ferryman</italic> . . . an implied indemnification such as a duty to perform in a workmanlike manner is properly an implied indemnification").

A more extensive line of cases, however, recognizing that if the implied indemnification theory was widely accepted, the "trade-off" of the workers' compensation act would be largely inapplicable to contractors, has read <italic>Ferryman</italic> differently and required additional specific allegations of an independent legal relationship in order for an indemnification claim to be legally sufficient. See <italic>Maslansky v. First</italic><italic>Assembly of God</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Danbury, Docket No. CV 01 0343545 (February 25, 2003, White, J.) ("Connecticut Superior Court case law is divergent concerning what a party has to allege in order to sufficiently plead an independent legal duty that will overcome the exclusivity of the Workers' Compensation Act. One line of cases . . . holds that a complaint must allege an independent legal duty distinct from an independent legal relationship in order to overcome the exclusivity of the Workers' Compensation Act. A final line of cases . . . strictly follows the language of <italic>Ferryman v. Groton</italic>, and holds that the<italic>specific allegation</italic> that a party breached its duty under a contract to perform work with due care is sufficient to establish an independent legal relationship and a claim for indemnification. In these cases, the court places special emphasis on the exact language that the contractor failed to perform [the] work with due care") (emphasis added).

This court has previously agreed with the majority approach, stating that "[a]lthough establishing that an implied promise to indemnify or an independent duty existed between proposed third-party plaintiffs and those sought to be impleaded may overcome the workers' compensation exclusivity bar, courts have construed this exception very narrowly . . . <italic>Ferryman</italic> makes clear that the key concern is preservation of the integrity of the Workers' Compensation Act. Given the insurance coverage costs imposed on employers as a result of the act they should be insulated from liability to third parties for their own negligence even though that negligence contributed to or was the primary factor in causing injury to the employee. However, where the employer has<italic>specifically agreed to indemnify</italic> third parties in situations such as this, or the law imposes that duty, or an employer has entered into a legal relationship through contract or even the creation of the law which imposes on the employer a duty to indemnify and this duty arises CT Page 20480 independently of the act and even anteriorly to its passage then the third-party's action should be allowed."

More recently, in <italic>Rivera v. Meriden</italic>, the court dissected the <italic>Ferryman</italic>
and explained the persuasiveness of majority view stating: "Cases like<italic>Britt [v.

The independent duty allowing such a result is created by the explicit agreement not merely to perform the contract in a workmanlike manner per contract specs but also to use due care with attention to safety considerations . . . With such an explicit contractual agreement, the party whom the injured employee sues for negligence should be able to implead the employer, and in effect say, you, the employer, agreed with me to do the work safely and with due care. You did not live up to your part of the bargain, and your lack of due care was what caused injury to your worker . . ." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Rivera v. Meriden</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven at New Haven, Docket No. CV 04 4000526 (March 23, 2006, Corradino, J.) (<cross_reference>41 Conn. L. Rptr. 98</cross_reference>, 100)<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

The explicit "due care" language found in <italic>Ferryman</italic> in no way undermines this greater point. For example, in the factually analogous case<italic>Maslansky v. First Assembly of God</italic>, an employee of the HB Communications was injured while repairing a projector on the defendant's premises. The defendant sought indemnity from the intervening plaintiff, and the CT Page 20481 intervening plaintiff filed a motion to strike based on the exclusivity provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. The court held that "the defendant alleges that the defendant and the intervening plaintiff entered into a contract whereby the intervening plaintiff agreed to `perform its work with due care and in a reasonably safe and workmanlike manner.' . . . The defendant alleges that the intervening plaintiff breached this duty by failing to properly train, warn, instruct and supervise the plaintiff and therefore is liable to the defendant for indemnification. <italic>Because the defendant uses the exact language of due</italic><italic>care that numerous courts have found particularly critical to a claim for</italic><italic>contractual indemnification</italic>, it has alleged an independent legal relationship sufficient to overcome the exclusivity of the Workers' Compensation Act and the motion to strike count two is denied." (Emphasis added.) <italic>Maslansky v. First Assembly of God</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, Superior Court, Docket No. CV 01 034545. Accord <italic>DeGraca v. Stearns  Wheler LLC</italic>, Superior Court, complex litigation docket at New Britain, Docket No. X 03 99 0509934 (February 26, 2003, Aurigemma, J.) (court denied motion to strike indemnification claim against the employer of an injured plaintiff where claim alleged that "pursuant to the contract, [employer] owed these defendants an independent legal duty to erect and maintain all safety apparatus and implement appropriate measures with respect to job safety," and that employer "owed these defendants a duty to perform work in a first class workmanlike manner"); <italic>Rowan v. Briasco</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Middlesex at Middletown, Docket No. CV 99 0088887 (January 25, 2000, Gordon, J.) (<cross_reference>26 Conn. L. Rptr. 309</cross_reference>, 310) (court granted intervenor's motion to strike indemnification claim where claimant merely alleged independent legal relationship pursuant to contract for home improvements, and failed to point to any specific contractual provision which could arguably give rise to independent duty); <italic>Britt v. Danziger Development</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, <cross_reference>28 Conn. L. Rptr. 625</cross_reference> (court denied motion to strike where counterclaimants alleged they entered into contract in which contractor "agreed to . . . perform work . . . in a reasonably safe and workmanlike manner").

As detailed above, in the present case, Adams alleges that Comfort Zone acted negligently in its supervision and training of Dutton. She does not allege, however, that Comfort Zone agreed to do the work with due care, which most cases have determined that <italic>Ferryman</italic> requires.

<center>                                 CONCLUSION</center>
For the foregoing reasons, Comfort Zone's motion to strike is granted.

</unpublished></opinion_text><unpublished><footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Comfort Zone filed a separate motion to strike Three Gates' cross claim on the same ground. That motion was also scheduled to be heard at CT Page 20482 short calendar on August 1, 2011. At oral argument, Comfort Zone's motion to strike Three Gates' cross claim was held over by the court because Three Gates' counsel was not present. Thus, the motion to strike Adams' cross claim is currently the only matter before the court.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Apparently, Comfort Zone is referring to General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>31-284</cross_reference>, which provides in relevant part: "(a) An employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not be liable for any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained, but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as provided under this chapter . . . All rights and claims between an employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and employees . . . arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter, provided nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional compensation from his employer for the injury or from enforcing any agreement for additional compensation."</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> In the same opinion, Judge Corradino mentions in a footnote that if the active tortfeasors alleged that the "contractor's obligation to use due care and violation thereof was the sole cause of injury" then they might have been entitled to indemnity from the contractor. Nevertheless, this statement must be read in conjunction with the definition of "due care" laid out in the <italic>Scrivenes</italic> opinion, which was referenced several times and in many ways served as the basis for the <italic>Rivera</italic> opinion. In<italic>Scrivenes</italic>, Judge Corradino made clear that "due care" must be specifically alleged:

<block_quote>  "All of the allegations have nothing to do with whether [the work was done] in a workmanlike manner but only to do with allegations about slippery working conditions, inadequate lighting, failure to put warning signs concerning those conditions. Thus, the language of the . . . third party complaint now before the court does not allege that the due care obligation referenced in <italic>Ferryman</italic> was explicitly assumed by [the contractor] toward [the third party plaintiff]. Even if the court's view is incorrect and the language is ambiguous on this point, given the policy behind the Workers' Compensation Act, this ambiguity should not suffice to withstand a motion to strike." <italic>Rivera v.</italic> <italic>Meriden</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, Superior Court, Docket No. 044000526.</block_quote></footnote_body>
