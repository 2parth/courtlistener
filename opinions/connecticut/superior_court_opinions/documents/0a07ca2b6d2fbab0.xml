This action was initiated by a complaint filed on October 23, 2006, seeking damages for burns and scarring of the plaintiff, an infant, resulting from an unforeseeable surge of hot water while being bathed by her father. The plaintiff is Rahsaiya Smith, a minor child acting herein by her mother, Lisa Labbe. The defendant is Carusone Associates, LLC. In hand service of process was performed by leaving a true and attested copy of the writ, summons and complaint in the hands of Frank H. Cathcart, agent for service for the defendant. A default for failure to appear was granted on November 17, 2006. The defendant did not appear at the hearing in damages held by the court on April 20, 2007.

At the hearing in damages, the plaintiff requested leave to amend the complaint, dated April 20, 2007, seeking the additional relief of punitive damages. The request for leave was improvidently granted at the time of the hearing and is now therefore vacated.

The plaintiff was injured by scalding water during a bath when she was a three-week-old infant. The plaintiff's father testified that, suddenly and without warning, scalding water flowed from the bathroom sink while he was giving the plaintiff a bath. This hot water immediately caused second degree burns to her thighs and to her abdomen. The plaintiff was immediately treated for these burns at MidState Medical, after which she was transported to and admitted to the Bridgeport hospital burn unit for one week. Treatment of her wounds included surgery for the application of "synthetic" skin. The cost of her treatment totaled $ 7,533.55.

The plaintiff's second degree burns have resulted in scarring on both of her thighs and on her lower abdomen, which is now evident as a CT Page 8738 discoloration of her skin in the affected areas. The father described the plaintiff's scream at the time of the incident. According to her parents, she now fears water and has difficulty falling asleep.

Her parents further indicated that the family had recently moved into the apartment at 106 Bunker Avenue where the scalding incident occurred. Initially, they had noticed a problem with the hot water in that it would change from warm to cold, but that it was never unbearably hot. The plaintiff has introduced into evidence the City of Meriden Housing Department record of the premises which demonstrates a history of housing violations spanning a period of years. The Housing Department file indicates prior problems at the same address with water that was too hot. The parents of Rahshaiya Smith have testified to repeated complaints to the defendant about the hot water, which complaints were ignored before and after the plaintiff was injured.

When the plaintiff's parents moved into 106 Bunker Avenue they dealt exclusively with Michael Mingolello, the defendant's agent. The Housing Department told police that Mingolello had been arrested for ten (10) counts of housing violations in 2005. The plaintiff's parents gave the police their phone records indicating how many calls were made to the defendant in the days after they moved in and just before and after the scalding incident. Nothing was done about the hot water by the defendant. The police report indicates that Michael Mingolello was arrested for risk of injury to a minor in connection with this incident.

The amended complaint provided for a substantive change in the relief sought by the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff certified that a copy had been sent to the defendant, proper notice was not provided to the defendant of this substantive change in the pleading. Therefore, upon default by the defendant, judgment shall enter for the plaintiff based upon the original complaint in this matter and not upon the amended complaint as previously indicated by the court.

Practice Book § 17-41 provides: "Upon a default, the plaintiff can have no greater relief than that demanded in the complaint; but in any other case the judicial authority may, upon a proper amendment, grant the plaintiff any other relief, consistent with the case made on the trial and embraced within the issues." Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-60</cross_reference>(a) provides in relevant part that "a party may amend his or her pleadings or other parts of the record or proceedings at any time subsequent to that stated CT Page 8739 in the preceding section<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> . . . (1) By order of judicial authority; or (2) By written consent of the adverse party; or (3) By filing a request for leave to file such amendment, with the amendment appended,<italic>after service upon each party as provided by Sections <cross_reference>10-12</cross_reference> through</italic><italic><cross_reference>10-17</cross_reference>, and with proof of service endorsed thereon</italic>. If no objection thereto has been filed by any party within fifteen days from the date of the filing of said request, the amendment shall be deemed to have been filed by consent of the adverse party." (Emphasis added.)

Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-12</cross_reference>(c) provides: "Any pleading asserting new or additional claims for relief against parties who have not appeared or who have been defaulted shall be served on such parties." Section <cross_reference>10-13</cross_reference>
provides in relevant part: "Service pursuant to Section <cross_reference>10-12</cross_reference>(c) shall be made in the same manner as an original writ and complaint is served or as ordered by the judicial authority." Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-13</cross_reference>. Furthermore, Practice Book <cross_reference>10-14</cross_reference>(b) provides: "Proof of service pursuant to Section <cross_reference>10-12</cross_reference>(c) shall be made in the same manner as proof of service is made of an original writ and complaint, unless the judicial authority ordered service in some other manner in which event service may be proved as prescribed in (a) above."

Service of the amended complaint in this case was performed by certification and not by service of process. Therefore, the additional relief of punitive damages sought in the amended complaint may not be granted by the court.

The plaintiff presented evidence of medical bills in the amount of $ 7,533.55, which the court finds as economic damages. The court further finds non-economic damages in the amount of $ 75,000.00 for the plaintiff's pain, suffering and scarring.

<center>                             <italic>IV. CONCLUSION</italic></center>
Judgment shall enter for the plaintiff in the amount of $ 82,533.55 on the original complaint.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Preceding section provides: "The plaintiff may amend any defect, mistake or informality in the writ, complaint or petition and insert new counts in the complaint, which might have been originally inserted therein, without costs, during the first thirty days after the return day." Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-59</cross_reference>.</footnote_body>
