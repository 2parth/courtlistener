</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This is a two-count complaint against the defendants, Brian Sikes and Sikes Tree Service seeking damages for decedent's death when he was fatally injured while cutting down a tree. The first count alleges that the defendants negligently caused fatal injuries to the plaintiff's decedent who was an independent contractor. The second count alleges that the defendants intentionally caused fatal injuries to the plaintiff's decedent who was the defendants' employee.

In the first count the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Brian Sikes, owns defendant Sikes Tree Service and contracted with the plaintiff's decedent to perform tree cutting work. Pursuant to his contract, the plaintiff's decedent performed tree cutting work for the defendants as an independent contractor. On January 10, 2000, the plaintiff's decedent was fatally injured while cutting down an entangled dead tree. In the second count the plaintiff alleges substantially similar facts except that he alleges that the plaintiff's decedent was an employee and that the defendants knew or were substantially certain that directing the plaintiff's decedent to cut down an entangled dead tree would result in the plaintiff's decedent receiving fatal injuries.

The defendant moves for summary judgment on both counts on the ground that the workers' compensation statutes, General Statutes § <cross_reference>31-275</cross_reference> et seq., provide the plaintiff's exclusive remedy.

The defendants argue that the undisputed facts show that the plaintiff's decedent was an employee at all times, including at the time of the fatal injury, and that there is no evidence of intentional or substantially certain injury. The plaintiff argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether the plaintiff's decedent was an employee or an independent contractor because the plaintiff's decedent CT Page 9818 had not yet completed its employee tax withholding forms and was, therefore, an independent contractor when he was fatally injured. The plaintiff further argues in connection with his second count, that an issue of material fact exists whether the defendants knew or were substantially certain that the plaintiff's decedent would be injured.

General Statutes § <cross_reference>31-275</cross_reference>(9)(A) defines "employee" as including "any person" who "[h]as entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether the contract contemplated the performance of duties within or without the state . . ." Under the relevant part of § <cross_reference>31-275</cross_reference>(9)(B), "employee" does not include "[o]ne whose employment is of a casual nature and who is employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer's trade or business . . ."

For purposes of workers' compensation, our courts have used the "right to control test" in determining whether a person is an employee as opposed to an independent contractor. "The `right to control' test determines the [relationship between a worker and a putative employer] by asking whether the putative employer has the right to control the means and methods used by the worker in the performance of his or her job."<italic>Hanson v. Transportation General, Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>245 Conn. 613</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>620</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>716 A.2d 857</cross_reference>
(1998). See <italic>Szestowicki v. Carlone,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland at Rockville, Docket No. CV 00 0074207 (September 23, 2003, Scholl, J.) (35 conn. 520). "The controlling consideration in the determination whether the relationship of master and servant exists or that of independent contractor exists is: Has the employer the general authority to direct what shall be done and when and how it shall be done — the right of general control of the work?" <italic>Kaliszewski v. Weathermaster</italic><italic>Alsco Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>148 Conn. 624</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>629</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>173 A.2d 497</cross_reference> (1961).

The defendants have submitted a certified affidavit in which the defendant, Brian Sikes, states that he hired the plaintiff's decedent to work at an hourly rate, determined each day what hours the plaintiff's decedent would work for the defendants, assigned tasks, instructed the plaintiff's decedent how assigned tasks were to be done, provided the plaintiff's decedent with the tools and equipment necessary for carrying out assigned tasks and directed the plaintiff's decedent to stop working on one task to begin working another. The plaintiff has failed to introduce any evidence that the plaintiff's decedent exercised the right to any control. Accordingly, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the defendants, and not the plaintiff's decedent, had the right to control the means and methods used by the worker in the performance of his or her job.

The plaintiff claims that there is an issue of fact regarding whether CT Page 9819 at the time of the fatal accident the plaintiff's decedent had filled out W-2/W-4 forms or an I-9 employment eligibility verification form, which he argues is required of all employees, but not independent contractors. He urges that because these forms establish the employer/employee relationship, the plaintiff's decedent was an independent contractor unless or until such forms had been completed, and therefore if the forms were not completed, a reasonable jury could find that the plaintiff's decedent was an independent contractor.

Thus, plaintiff seeks to introduce a new test of the master-servant relationship for workers' compensation purposes. However, our Supreme Court has stated that "there is no dispute about the ultimate test. <italic>It is</italic><italic>the right of general control of the means and methods used by the person</italic><italic>whose status is involved.</italic>" (Emphasis added.) <italic>Hanson v. Transportation</italic><italic>General, Inc., supra,</italic> <cross_reference>245 Conn. 617</cross_reference>. Furthermore, that decision makes it clear that the right to control is the sole test to be applied, observing that "[d]ual standards for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor would complicate the administration of our workers' compensation system." <italic>Id.,</italic> 620.

The plaintiff has failed to present any authority in Connecticut or any other jurisdiction to support his claim that withholding forms are probative of a worker's status as employee or independent contractor for purposes of workers' compensation, and none has been found. As the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has observed, in affirming summary judgment where the trial court had determined that a worker was an employee, the "characterizations of [the plaintiff] as a "subcontractor" or "independent contractor" for tax purposes alone do not support the proposition that [the plaintiff] was an independent contractor under the governing legal standard. Withholding practices may simply reflect an attempt to avoid responsibility for payroll costs including workers' compensation coverage." <italic>North East Ins. Co. v. Soucy,</italic> <cross_reference>693 A.2d 1141</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1145</cross_reference>
(Me. 1997).

Furthermore, the undisputed facts do not indicate that this case qualifies as an exception to the exclusivity rule set forth in <italic>Suarez v.</italic><italic>Dickmont Plastics Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>242 Conn. 255</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>280</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>698 A.2d 838</cross_reference> (1997), which allows an employee to recover in tort when the employer intends injury or knows that injury is substantially certain to occur. There is no factual basis for a jury to conclude that the defendants intentionally injured the plaintiff's decedent or that they knew that injury was substantially certain to occur when defendant Brian Sikes directed the plaintiff's decedent to cut down an entangled dead tree. Brian Sikes' affidavit CT Page 9820 states that he himself had performed similar operations many times before without incurring injury and that the plaintiff's decedent told Sikes that he knew how to perform the operation without incurring injury.

"While summary judgment is ordinarily inappropriate where an individual's intent and state of mind are implicated . . . [t]he summary judgment rule would be rendered sterile . . . if the mere incantation of intent or state of mind would operate as a talisman to defeat an otherwise valid motion." <italic>Jaser v. Fischer,</italic> <cross_reference>65 Conn. App. 349</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>357</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>783 A.2d 28</cross_reference> (2001).

Because this action is barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.
