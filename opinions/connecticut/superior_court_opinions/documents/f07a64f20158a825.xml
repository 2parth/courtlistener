<opinion_text><unpublished>  On or about March 21, 1995, the petitioner was sentenced to 12 years incarceration execution suspended after 4 years incarceration to be followed by five years of probation.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> After serving a period of incarceration the petitioner was thereafter on probation. The petitioner was subsequently arrested for a violation of probation.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

On April 7, 1999, a violation of probation hearing was held. The court found that the "defendant violated the conditions of his probation by not CT Page 8019-z co-operating with the Probation Department and/or the individuals at the Sexual Offender Program, by arriving late, by arriving with the attitude that he was not making that part of his probationary condition a priority item by not cooperating with the Probation Department and the treatment organization." (Tr., April 7, 1999, page 132).

The court revoked the probation and imposed the unexecuted portion of the petitioner's sentence of 8 years incarceration to be served. It is this 8 year sentence that the petitioner seeks review.

At the hearing before the Division, Counsel for the petitioner argued that the sentence imposed was disproportionate to others similarly situated. Counsel indicated that the condition of probation for sex offender treatment was not originally imposed but added later by probation. Counsel does not challenge the authority of probation to so modify the petitioners conditions.

Counsel for petitioner categorized the violation as "technical" in that the substance of the violation was that the petitioner arrived late on two occasions for the sex offender treatment evaluation. Counsel also indicated that there was no indication that petitioner missed any appointments with the probation officer. One out of twelve sessions with the probation officer was missed inadvertently by the petitioner and the petitioner made up for the meeting the next day. Counsel stressed that the petitioner had been working during this period and became engaged to be married.

The record reveals that the petitioner was referred for evaluation for sex offender treatment.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> The evaluation process consisted of six sessions. The petitioner was tardy for two of the six sessions and on each of the two occasions the petitioner was advised to leave and for each of the two sessions the petitioner was considered to have "missed" each session. At the time of the second tardiness the petitioner told the therapist that "the (sessions) were not a priority in his life and (petitioner) couldn't arrange to arrive on time." The petitioner did not complete the sex offender valuation that served as a condition of probation.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> The record reflects the importance of being timely for evaluation sessions so that a full hour could be devoted to the client.

In the court's sentencing remarks the court alluded the narcotics case and indicated that the court was not going to consider the matter in the sentencing of the petitioner.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>
CT Page 8019-ab

Neither party brought the narcotics case to the attention of the Division.

Although, arguably, the court had the authority to consider the factual basis of the narcotics case (CR98-124871),<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> in determining an appropriate penalty after establishing the violation of probation, the court elected not to do so.

If the sentence of probation is revoked, the court may require the violator to serve the full sentence originally imposed, or it may impose any lesser sentence. C.G.S. ยง 58a-32(b). The authority of the court to impose the full unexecuted portion of the sentence is not challenged.

In reviewing the record as a whole, the Division finds that the sentence imposed by the court for the reasons articulated was disproportionate to others similarly situated. The division has considered the nature of the violation, the efforts expended by the petitioner to comply, the protection of the public interest and the deterrent, rehabilitative, isolative and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended.

Accordingly, the Division directs the trial court to modify the sentence imposed to a sentence of time of incarceration already served.

The matter is remanded to the trial court in order to impose sentence in accordance with the conclusion of the Division.

The sentenced imposed was disproportionate.

<bold>THE SENTENCE IS ORDERED MODIFIED.</bold>

Miano, J., Klaczak, J., and Norko, J. participated in this decision.

</unpublished></opinion_text><unpublished><footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The petitioner was sentenced on that date upon convictions of Violation of Probation, Burglary in the Second Degree, Sexual Assault in the Third Degree, Violation of a Protective Order and Assault in the Third Degree.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> On April 6, 1999, the day before the violation of probation hearing which disposition is the subject matter presently before the Division, the sentencing court presided over an evidentiary hearing on a narcotics case Docket No. CR98-12487 (hereinafter narcotics case) wherein it was alleged that the petitioner, while on probation, was in possession of CT Page 8019-ac narcotics with intent to sell. The court granted the petitioner's Motion to Suppress the alleged contraband.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> At the time the original sentence was imposed on March 21, 1995, the court did <underline>not</underline> impose a condition of probation requiring sexual offender evaluation and treatment. Subsequent to the petitioner being placed on probation, the probation officer added a condition of sexual offender evaluation and treatment to the probation. The defendant did not contest the authority of probation to add conditions of probation not originally imposed.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> The record reveals that after the petitioner was served with the arrest warrant for Violation of Probation on April 8, 1998, the petitioner inquired of his probation officer if there was another sex offender program he could attend. The probation officer suggested Sterling Center. The petitioner thereupon, voluntarily (not part of any probation condition or order) attended 7 counseling sessions at Sterling Center relevant to sex offender treatment.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> In the court's sentencing remarks the court indicated, <underline>inter alia</underline>
"(t)his court does not live in a vacuum, but for and <underline>I am not considering</underline><underline>this in my sentence,</underline> but I'm considering the prior drug convictions that (the prosecutor) refers to <underline>but for circumstances of a legal nature you</underline><underline>would have been exposed to another drug prosecution</underline> and but for the state's decision to drop the interfering, resisting charge to that charge as well. And I say that because as I introduced that comment with the statement I don't live in a vacuum. I know what's going on, and I can't ignore what's going on, and I wouldn't. I wouldn't. (Emphasis added).</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn6]</footnote_number> In the sentencing phase of a revocation proceeding, the sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within the statutory limits and in exercising that discretion he may and should consider matters that would not be admissible at trial. <underline>State v. Huey,</underline><cross_reference>199 Conn. 121</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>126</cross_reference> (1986); It is a fundamental sentencing principle that a sentencing judge may "appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, and largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider or the source from which it may come id., 127. As a matter of due process, information may be considered as a basis for a sentence only if it has some minimum indicium or reliability." <underline>Id.</underline></footnote_body>
