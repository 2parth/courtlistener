<opinion_text><unpublished>  Plaintiff has filed a motion to reargue. The court published its Memorandum of Decision on defendant's motion for contempt on March 25, 2003. At that time the court considered all of the evidence and all of the exhibits presented to the court. The plaintiff now argues that the court in making its finding on arrearage failed to consider the provisions of the agreement that the plaintiff's deferred income should be excluded from his annual gross earned income.

Paragraph 7.5 of the agreement requires proof in writing by August 1 of the amount of earned income of the plaintiff for the fiscal year which is deferred compensation. This was never furnished to the defendant. Nowhere in the numerous exhibits is there any evidence of the amount of deferred income plaintiff claims for each year.

There has been no demonstrable evidence of the plaintiff's deferred income and no evidence offered by the plaintiff of the amounts of deferred income for the year in question. The document marked as exhibit A marked in re-argument was offered as an aid to the court at the hearing held on December 13. The figures therein set forth are the plaintiff's own figures and without any verification. The court finds that this was not proof of the amounts of deferred income.

The motion to reargue is denied.
