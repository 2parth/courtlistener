</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  After hearing and a review of the briefs filed by both parties and the applicable law governing this matter, this court agrees with the State of Connecticut. This court lacks the subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this pro se motion to correct an "illegal disposition." The defendant cannot subvert the intent and purpose of Practice Book Section<cross_reference>43-22</cross_reference> to challenge a sentence based on some alleged defect in the conviction. The defendant's motion does not even address the sentence or disposition of his case. His only attack is on the validity of the underlying conviction.

Accordingly, Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence is denied and the State's Motion to Dismiss is granted.
