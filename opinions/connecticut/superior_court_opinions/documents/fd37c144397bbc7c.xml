The plaintiff, James Turner, brought this personal injury action by way of a three-count complaint served on September 19, 2006. Counts one and two are purportedly brought against Paul Piwarczyk, and count three is brought against Mary Piwarczyk.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Mary Piwarczyk filed an appearance on October 12, 2006. On January 3, 2007, Mary Piwarczyk filed a motion to dismiss, which is presently before the court. She moves to dismiss this action on the grounds of (1) insufficiency of process, in that the plaintiff failed to return process to the court at least six days before the return date and not later than two months after the date of the process, and (2) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, in that Paul Piwarczyk died on March 22, 2005, and was therefore deceased at the time that suit was commenced.

Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-30</cross_reference> provides in relevant part: "Any defendant, wishing to contest the court's jurisdiction . . . must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance. Practice Book § 10-32 provides in relevant part: "Any claim of insufficiency of process . . . is waived if not raised by a motion to dismiss filed . . . within the time provided by Section 10-30." "The rule specifically and unambiguously provides that any claim of lack of jurisdiction over the person as a result of an insufficiency of service of process is waived unless it is raised by a motion to dismiss filed within thirty days . . . Thus, thirty-one days after the filing of an appearance . . . a party is deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. Any claim of insufficiency of process is waived if not CT Page 8763 sooner raised." <italic>Pitchell v. Hartford</italic>, <cross_reference>247 Conn. 422</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>433</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>722 A.2d 797</cross_reference>
(1999). In the present case, Mary Piwarczyk filed the motion to dismiss eighty-three days after she filed her appearance. Accordingly, her claim of insufficiency of process was waived.

Mary Piwarczyk's October 20, 2006 motion for extension of time in which to file a pleading in response to the complaint does not change this result for a number of reasons. First, she never obtained a ruling on the motion for extension of time. Second, the time period the motion sought to extend was the time in which to file a pleading in response to the complaint which is, pursuant to Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-8</cross_reference>, thirty days from the <italic>return date</italic>, not the separate thirty-day period from the filing of the <italic>appearance</italic> in which insufficiency of process may be raised by way of a motion to dismiss pursuant to § <cross_reference>10-30</cross_reference>. Third, even if her motion were addressed to the time period set forth in § <cross_reference>10-30</cross_reference>, the judges of this court have concluded that the time period is mandatory and cannot be extended. See, e.g., <italic>GMAC Mortgage Corp. v. Tomkowicz</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Ansonia-Milford, Docket No. CV 06 6000085 (April 12, 2007, Moran, J.); Schrobenhause<italic>r v.</italic> Bielmatik-Leuze GmbH Co., Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 02 0818905 (March 7, 2003, Sheldon, J.) (<cross_reference>34 Conn. L. Rptr. 293</cross_reference>). Finally, by its own terms, the motion for extension of time sought a thirty-day extension of the thirty-day time period. Accordingly, even if the motion for extension of time had been granted and the § <cross_reference>10-30</cross_reference> time limit were not mandatory, the motion for extension of time would have given Mary Piwarczyk, at most, a total of sixty days from her appearance to raise her claim of insufficiency of process. As stated previously, she waited eighty-three days to file her motion to dismiss.

The claim of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter because Paul Piwarczyk was deceased at the time this action was commenced, however, cannot be waived. Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-33</cross_reference> provides: "Any claim of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived; and whenever it is found after suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the judicial authority shall dismiss the action." Mary Piwarczyk has submitted a certified copy of Paul Piwarczyk's death certificate showing his date of death as March 22, 2005, and the plaintiff does not dispute that date. As this court stated in a case presenting the same factual scenario, "[b]ecause this action was brought against a deceased defendant, this court lacks jurisdiction. <italic>O'Leary v. Waterbury Title Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>117 Conn. 39</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>47</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>166 A. 673</cross_reference> (1933). See also <italic>Noble v. Corkin</italic>, <cross_reference>45 Conn.Sup. 330</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>332-33</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>717 A.2d 301</cross_reference> (1998)."<italic>Wickham v. Vecchiarelli</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven at Meriden, Docket No. CV 02 0282115 (January 21, 2003, CT Page 8764 Wiese, J.) (<cross_reference>33 Conn. L. Rptr. 736</cross_reference>, 737). "[A] dead person is a nonexistent entity and cannot be a party to a suit. Therefore, proceedings instituted against an individual who is deceased at the time of the filing of suit are a nullity. Such proceedings are void ab initio and do not invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Noble v. Corkin</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, 333.

Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is granted as to counts one and two, which were brought against Paul Piwarczyk after his death. The motion to dismiss is denied as to count three, which is brought solely against Mary Piwarczyk.

The motion to dismiss is granted as to counts one and two and denied as to count three.

SO ORDERED

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The name Piwarczyk is spelled "Pivarzyk" in the summons and complaint. That spelling is apparently in error, in light of Mary Piwarczyk's spelling of her own name as "Piwarczyk."</footnote_body>
