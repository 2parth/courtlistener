The plaintiff, Leisure Farms Limited Partnership, appeals from a decision of one of the defendants, the Guilford Inland Wetlands Commission (commission), in which the commission denied an application for a permit to conduct a regulated activity and issued an unfavorable subdivision referral. The plaintiff appeals from the decision of the commission pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-43</cross_reference>(a). Also named as a defendant to this appeal is the commissioner of the department of environmental protection.

On November 8, 2004, the plaintiff filed an application with the Guilford Inland Wetlands Commission seeking permission to conduct regulated activities on property located at Blue Hills Drive and Bluff View Drive in Guilford, which would involve construction of homes and roads, as well as associated grading, subsurface sewage disposal systems and drainage.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> (Return of Record [ROR], Item 1, p. 1.) Of the 14.6-acre site, the regulated area consists of a 1.6-acre upland review area. (ROR, Item 1, p. 1.) The first discussion of the application was at the January 12, 2005 regular meeting of the commission. (ROR, Item 38, pp. 7-8.) The commission conducted a site walk of the subject property on January 22, 2005. (ROR, Item 39, p. 4.) After the application was tabled at the March 9, 2005 regular meeting of the commission, the commission conducted another site walk of the subject property on April 9, 2005. (ROR, Item 40, p. 4; Item 41, p. 3.) The commission conducted a public hearing regarding the application on April CT Page 11983 13, 2005, which was continued to May 12, 2005. (ROR, Item 42, pp. 18-22; Item 43, pp. 2-5.) Immediately after the public hearing was closed on May 12, 2005, the commission deliberated on the application and voted to deny it without prejudice, expressly enumerating four reasons for the denial.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> (ROR, Item 45, pp. 36-45; Item 43, pp. 5-6.) The plaintiff appealed from the commission's decision to the Superior Court and the appeal was tried to the court, Holden, J., on April 3, 2007. The plaintiff filed a brief in support of its appeal on July 11, 2006. The commission filed a brief seeking dismissal of the appeal on September 22, 2006. The commissioner of the department of environmental protection filed a brief on October 25, 2006, in which she takes no position as to whether substantial evidence exists on the record as a whole to support the decision of the commission.

"[P]leading and proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to a trial court's jurisdiction over the subject matter of an administrative appeal. . . It is [therefore] fundamental that, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved."

"Aggrievement presents a question of fact for the trial court and the party alleging aggrievement bears the burden of proving it." <italic>Id.</italic>, 538-39. An owner of property that is the subject of an application is aggrieved for the purpose of bringing an appeal, and a plaintiff may prove aggrievement by testimony at the time of trial;<italic>Winchester Woods Associates v.

"Two broad yet distinct categories of aggrievement exist, classical and statutory. . . Classical aggrievement requires a two part showing. First, a party must demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as opposed to a general interest that all members of the community share. . . Second, the party must also show that the agency's decision has specially and injuriously affected CT Page 11984 that specific personal or legal interest. . . Aggrievement does not demand certainty, only the possibility of an adverse effect on a legally protected interest."

In the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that it "is aggrieved by the decision of the defendant [c]ommission because it is the applicant and owner of the property for which the application was made and cannot carry out its intended activities as a result of the denial." (Appeal, ¶ 8.) At the trial held on April 3, 2007, Gaetano Troiano testified that he is the principal owner of Leisure Farms Limited Partnership, the applicant in this matter. (Transcript, pp. 3-4.) Troiano further testified that Leisure Farms Limited Partnership owns the parcel of land that is the subject of this appeal. (Transcript, p. 4.) Troiano identified the parcel in question as that depicted in ROR, Item 48 (Blue Hills Drive and Bluff View Drive in Guilford, section nine of Bluff Head Subdivision). (Transcript, pp. 4-5.) "[A] plaintiff's status as owner of the property establishes that [it] has a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision. The fact that the agency's decision resulted in the denial to the plaintiff of the ability to use this property as proposed establishes that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected."

Accordingly, the court finds that the plaintiff has pleaded and proven classical aggrievement.

General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-43</cross_reference>(a) provides, in part, that an appeal from a decision by an inland wetlands agency must be commenced "within the time specified in subsection (b) of section <cross_reference>8-8</cross_reference>, from the publication of such. . . decision. . ." Section <cross_reference>8-8</cross_reference>(b) provides, in part, that an appeal "shall be commenced by service of process. . . within fifteen days from the date that notice of the decision was published as required by the general statutes." Section <cross_reference>22a-43</cross_reference>(a) further provides that "[n]otice of such appeal shall be served upon the inland wetlands agency and the commissioner, provided, for any such appeal taken on or after October 1, 2004, service of process for purposes of such notice to the inland wetlands agency shall be made in accordance with subdivision (5) of subsection (b) of section 52-57." Finally, section <cross_reference>52-57</cross_reference>(b) provides that "[p]rocess in civil actions against the following-described classes of defendants shall be served as follows. . . (5) against a board, CT Page 11985 commission, department or agency of a town, city or borough, notwithstanding any provision of law, upon the clerk of the town, city or borough, provided two copies of such process shall be served upon the clerk and the clerk shall retain one copy and forward the second copy to the board, commission, department or agency. . ."

The plaintiff alleges that notice of the commission's decision was published in the <italic>Shoreline Times</italic> on May 25, 2005. (Appeal, ¶ 7.) In its answer, the commission admits that the decision of the commission was published on that date. (Commission's answer, ¶ 7.) The plaintiff commenced this appeal on June 8, 2005 by service of process upon the Guilford town clerk by leaving two copies of the original writ, summons, appeal and citation. (Marshal's return.) Service was made upon the commissioner of the department of environmental protection on June 8, 2005 by leaving a copy of the original writ, summons, appeal and citation with Christine Kaiser, Office of the Ombudsman. (Marshal's return.) As this appeal was commenced by service of process within fifteen days from the date of publication, the court finds that it is timely and that service was proper.

"In challenging an administrative agency action, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. . . The plaintiff must do more than simply show that another decision maker, such as the trial court, might have reached a different conclusion. Rather than asking the reviewing court to retry the case de novo. . . the plaintiff must establish that substantial evidence does not exist in the record as a whole to support the agency's decision. . ." In reviewing an inland wetlands agency decision made pursuant to the act, the reviewing court must sustain the agency's determination if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given. . . The evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial; [t]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency. . . This so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the sufficiency of the evidence standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . The reviewing court must take into account [that there is] contradictory evidence in the record. . . but the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial CT Page 11986 evidence. . ."

The plaintiff appeals on the grounds that the commission's denial of the application was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious, characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion, in excess of statutory authority, made upon unlawful procedure and affected by error and misapplication of the law in that: (a) "The decision of the [c]ommission is not supported by substantial evidence"; (b) the commission "considered evidence that was outside of the record thereby denying the applicant the right to rebuttal and the right to a fair hearing"; (c) the commission "ignored credible expert evidence and instead relied upon non-expert testimony of technical and scientific issues"; (d) the commission "[d]enied the application in its original form when the [applicant] submitted feasible alternatives, which alternatives were not considered or acted upon by the [c]ommission"; (e) the commission "considered issues outside of the scope of authority including, but not limited to denying portions of the application that are beyond its review area and upon, which it has no jurisdiction"; (f) the commission "is regulating upland areas that are well beyond a reasonable review area for the [c]ommission and upon which it has no jurisdiction"; and (g) the commission "failed to indicate reasonable alternatives or to make a finding of reasonable feasible alternatives for each of the stated reasons for denying the application." (Appeal, ¶ 9.)

It is a well settled principle that "[c]laims mentioned but not adequately briefed are deemed abandoned." <italic>Brunswick v. Inland Wetlands</italic><italic>Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>29 Conn.App. 634</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>638</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>617 A.2d 466</cross_reference> (1992). The only issues that the plaintiff has adequately briefed are whether the record lacks substantial evidence to support the commission's determination that the proposed construction would have an adverse impact on the wetlands and whether the commission failed to consider the feasible alternatives that the plaintiff had submitted. All other issues are deemed abandoned and the court will not address them.

CT Page 11987  <italic>a Regulated Activity</italic></center>
The plaintiff argues that its appeal should be sustained because the record lacks substantial evidence to indicate that the proposed activity in the upland review area would result in an adverse impact to the wetlands. Specifically, the plaintiff maintains that the commission "was basing its decision on the opinion of the applicant and its. . . engineering firm," Milone  MacBroom, Inc., which does not support the determination that the wetlands will be negatively impacted. (Plaintiff's brief, p. 8.) The plaintiff also notes that the Guilford health director, Dennis Johnson, testified at the hearing that all of the building lots in question met state and local standards to qualify for septic systems. Moreover, the plaintiff contends that although the commission received a negative environmental report from the Southwest conservation district, the plaintiff subsequently addressed all of the district's concerns and requests. The plaintiff argues that there is nothing in the record from anyone with expertise to show that the plaintiff's proposed activities will have any impact on the wetlands.

The commission counters that because the findings contained in the reasons for denial could be reasonably inferred from the factual evidence in the record, the plaintiff's claims are without merit. The commission argues that the applicant failed to provide it with drainage data, despite its requests. The commission contends that based on its own knowledge of the topography of the area, in addition to the expert evidence provided to it by the Southwest conservation district, it reasonably could conclude that the wetlands would become polluted. Furthermore, the commission maintains that there was substantial evidence in the record, specifically, testimony by the applicant's engineering firm, Milone  MacBroom, Inc., to support its conclusion that the hydrology of the wetlands would be altered by the proposal. Finally, the commission argues that the comments from the Southwest conservation district reasonably support its conclusion that the water temperature of the wetlands would be altered.

"The sine qua non of review of inland wetlands applications is a determination whether the proposed activity will cause an <italic>adverse</italic><italic>impact</italic> to a wetland or watercourse."<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> <italic>River Bend Associates, Inc. v.</italic><italic>Conservation  Inland Wetlands Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>269 Conn. 57</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>74</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>848 A.2d 395</cross_reference>
(2004). It is well established that "[d]etermining what constitutes an adverse impact on a wetland is a technically complex issue."<italic>Id.</italic>, 78. "[E]xpert testimony may be required when the question involved goes beyond the ordinary knowledge and experience of the trier of fact." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Feinson v. Conservation</italic><italic>Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>180 Conn. 421</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>428</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>429 A.2d 910</cross_reference> (1980). "Common sense" may CT Page 11988 not be substituted "for expert testimony on the highly technical subject of how upland construction activity would impact a wetland." <italic>Toll</italic><italic>Brothers, Inc. v. Inland Wetlands Commission</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, Docket No. CV 03 0523880 (January 20, 2006, Mottolese, J.T.R.) (40 Conn. L. Rptr. 707, 712 n. 5). An administrative agency, however, "is not required to believe any witness, even an expert, nor is it required to use in any particular fashion any of the materials presented to it so long as the conduct of the hearing is fundamentally fair." <italic>Huck v. Inland Wetlands </italic><italic>Watercourses Agency, supra</italic>, <cross_reference>203 Conn. 542</cross_reference>.

The record reveals the following. The plaintiff's engineering firm, Milone  MacBroom, Inc., reported that "[t]he dominant soil on the site is the well-drained Cheshire, fine sandy loam. The other common upland soil identified on the site is Holyoke, which is shallow to bedrock." (ROR, Item 7, p. 1.) Data from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service regarding sewage disposal reveals that Cheshire and Holyoke soils are rated as "very limited" and have "one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected." (ROR, Item 27, pp. 3-5.) Moreover, these soils generally receive a rating of 1, which indicates that they possess features that have "the greatest negative impact on the use. . ." (ROR, Item 27, pp. 3-5.) Their excessive slope ratings indicate that they "may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas." (ROR, Item 27, pp. 3-5.) The depth to bedrock of Holyoke soils affects "absorption of the effluent." (ROR, Item 27, pp. 3-4.) Absorption fields "may not adequately filter the effluent" and "[a]s a result, the ground water may become contaminated." (ROR, Item 27, pp. 3-4.)

The Southwest conservation district similarly reported to the commission: "Bedrock controlled hydrology, including perched water tables, natural drainage ways with seasonally high water tables and small wet depressions can be found in the HuD-Holyoke-Cheshire complex found on this site. Septic tank absorption fields require very careful and often unusual design and installation to insure that effluent does not seep to the surface areas downslope from the leaching system. There is a hazard of effluent seeping into cracks in the bedrock and polluting the ground water, which is a source of drinking water in many places." (ROR, Item 13, p. 2.)

In reviewing the plaintiff's plan in its original form, the Southwest conservation district commented: "The site plan [with regard to the proposed driveway on lot six] indicates a 12" pipe to accommodate flows CT Page 11989 under the proposed driveway. Filling for the driveway and grading for the house placement are proposed to disturb to within five feet of the delineated wetland boundary. Disturbances in this area are likely to affect the wetlands directly and may also affect the sub surface flow of water supplying the wetlands. Conveying the flow at one point concentrates the flow instead of allowing sheet flow during periods of water at or near the surface." (ROR, Item 13, p. 3.) Regarding lot five, the Southwest conservation district advised: "Disturbances from road grading within a few feet of the flagged wetland boundary in the vicinity of wetlands flags 48  49 are also likely to have a direct impact on the wetlands and possibly impact at or near surface water flow from the slope west of the proposed road and into the wetlands. Grading in the location of the proposed road has already disturbed soils in the area of the surface water flow." (ROR, Item 13, pp. 5-6.)

The Southwest conservation district concluded that "[s]urrounding the wetlands with houses driveways and lawns could impact surface and ground water flows and quality, affect temperature regimes of the surface water due to decreased shading, inhibit overland travel of animal species etc." (ROR, Item 13, p. 8.) It further noted that "[a]s the soils descriptions indicate, there could be impact to surface and groundwater if system design or installation is inadequate." (ROR, Item 13, p. 8.) Although the plaintiff made changes to its plan subsequent to the Southwest conservation district's report, the district's observations and general conclusions remain applicable due to the hydrology and the soils found on the site.

The court finds an adequate basis for the commission's decision. As the record contains substantial evidence in the form of expert testimony indicating that pollution will be introduced into the wetlands and the hydrology and water temperature will be altered, the court determines that the commission's reasons in support of its decision are supported by substantial evidence.

The plaintiff argues that it made a number of changes and improvements to the original plan based upon issues that were raised at the public hearing on April 13, 2005. The plaintiff maintains that the revised plan moved houses, septic systems and roads further from the wetlands and that another site walk by the commission was not necessary.

CT Page 11990

The commission counters that at the public hearing on May 12, 2005, the plaintiff presented it with changes on each of the five lots where the wetlands were located. The defendant argues that, consequently, several members of the commission wished to walk the site again and consider the application further due to the plan's significant revisions. The defendant asserts that the commission did not err in denying the application without prejudice, which permits the plaintiff to resubmit its application with any modifications,<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> while giving the commission sufficient time to review the new layout in the field.

The record reveals the following. On May 12, 2005, in response to the revisions to the plan, the commission chairman, Edward Kreidel, stated at the public hearing: "They're still changes that, you know, are significant, I think; and if they are improvements, I mean moving a septic system closer to the wetland, I don't know." (ROR, Item 45, p. 22.) Similarly, while the commission was deliberating on May 12, 2005, commission member Robert Richard stated: "I'm glad to see the way the [a]pplicant moved the houses on lots. . . 6, 7, 8; but because it's still in very close proximity to the wetlands, a lot of the activity and there's lots of sensitivity, I really want to get out there and see the house locations in relation to the wetland, in relation to the slopes, in relation to the vernal pools." (ROR, Item 45, p. 40.) Thereafter, commission member Tom Cost suggested that the commission deny the application without prejudice "so that we can have a talk about this and we re-fly that plane and then we could walk this again, and we could get all the information again." (ROR, Item 45, p. 40.)

<center>                                   VI</center><center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
Based on the foregoing the court finds an adequate basis for the commission's decision. As the record contains substantial evidence that the revisions to the plan were in fact considered but were not entirely satisfactory, the court determines that the commission's decision to deny the application without prejudice because more in depth review was warranted is supported by substantial evidence.

The plaintiff's appeal is dismissed because it has failed to prove the grounds it advanced claiming that the commission acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or in abuse of its discretion and because the commission's decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The plaintiff also sought a boundary clarification, which was approved by the commission and is not subject to this appeal. CT Page 11991 (Plaintiff's brief, p. 2.)

In addition, the plaintiff applied for a favorable subdivision referral to the planning and zoning commission, but an unfavorable report was given. (ROR, Item 31, pp. 1-2.) Although the plaintiff appeals from the agency's action, the agency's decision to report unfavorably on the subdivision referral was purely advisory and is not appealable. General Statutes § <cross_reference>8-26</cross_reference> provides that "[i]n making its decision [on a plan for a subdivision] the [planning and zoning] commission shall give due consideration to the report of the inland wetlands agency." The Supreme Court expounded in Carr v. Planning 
Zoning Commission, <cross_reference>273 Conn. 573</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>598</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>872 A.2d 385</cross_reference> (2005) that the report of an inland wetlands agency "is not binding on a planning and zoning commission in considering a subdivision application."</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The commission's reasons for denial were that: (1) "the proposed activities in the construction plan will directly introduce pollution directly into the wetlands including, but not limited to, the result of activities surrounding drilling for a well, clearing and grubbing for residences, construction of road and driveway with deep cuts and fill proposed by the [a]pplicant"; (2) "the alteration of the topography on the site proposed by the [a]pplicant will cause direct alteration of the hydrology on-site"; (3) "the increased runoff from construction activities increases impervious surfaces and decrease in vegetation created by construction clearing and residential use as indicated on the site development plans will directly alter the water temperature of the wetlands"; and (4) the changes to the plan "are significant enough to warrant more in-depth review" and "justify a new application." (ROR, Item 45, pp. 43-45; Item 43, p. 6.)</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-41</cross_reference>(a) requires a wetlands commission to consider: "(1) The environmental impact of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses; (2) The applicant's purpose for, and any feasible and prudent alternatives to, the proposed regulated activity which alternatives would cause less or no environmental impact to wetlands or watercourses; (3) The relationship between the short-term and long-term impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of such wetlands or watercourses; (4) Irreversible and irretrievable loss of wetland or watercourse resources which would be caused by the proposed regulated activity. . . (5) The character and degree of injury to, or interference with, safety, health or the reasonable use of property which is caused or threatened by the proposed regulated activity; and (6) Impacts of the proposed regulated activity on wetlands or watercourses outside the area for which the activity is CT Page 11992 proposed and future activities associated with, or reasonably related to, the proposed regulated activity which are made inevitable by the proposed regulated activity and which may have an impact on wetlands or watercourses."</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> Section <cross_reference>22a-39-7.2</cross_reference> of the regulations of the department of environmental protection provides in relevant part: "The Commissioner may deny a permit. . . without prejudice. . . If a permit is denied without prejudice, the applicant may modify, amend or correct his proposal."</footnote_body>
