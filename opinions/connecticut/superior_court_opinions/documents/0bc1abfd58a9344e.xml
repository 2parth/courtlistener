The plaintiffs, Neighborhood Properties, LLC, Thomas Corville, and the Lincoln Bradley Association appeal from a decision of the defendant, the Board of Zoning Appeals of New Haven (Board), in which the Board granted a special exception application of the defendant, United Shoreline Federal Credit Union.

<center>                                   II.</center><center>                               <italic>BACKGROUND</italic></center>
United Shoreline Federal Credit Union (Credit Union) filed an application to the Board for a special exception for the joint use of four (4) parking spaces on May 16, 2003 (ROR, Ex. 3). Section 29.11 of the Zoning Ordinance provides that a special exception may be granted for a joint use of the same parking space or spaces. Section 45.C.1 of the Zoning Ordinance which governs drive-in establishments, provides for the free flow of traffic and protection of pedestrian areas. The record reflects that the defendant Credit Union's representative, Bruce Tiven, signed a ten-year lease agreement with the defendant, Flagg Associates, contingent upon the joint use of four parking spaces. (ROR, Ex. 3; Ex. 19, pp. 15-16. Section 63(E)) provides that the Board shall hold a public hearing with respect to special exception applications and the Board shall forward copies of the application to the City Plan Department and the Department of Traffic and Parking.

After a public hearing the Board approved the application.

The plaintiffs are Neighborhood Properties, LLC, Thomas CT Page 18837 Corville and the Lincoln-Bradley Association. The defendants are the Board and the Credit Union. The plaintiffs filed this appeal with the Superior Court on July 19, 2003, alleging that the Board's grant of the special exception was arbitrary, illegal, and in abuse of discretion. The court, Burns, J.T.R. conducted the trial on September 14, 2004.

General Statutes § <cross_reference>8-8</cross_reference> governs an appeal from a zoning board of appeals to the Superior Court. A plaintiff may take advantage of a statutory right of appeal only by complying strictly with the statutory provisions governing that right. <italic>Bridgeport</italic><italic>Bowl-O-Rama, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Appeals,</italic> <cross_reference>195 Conn. 276</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>283</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>487 A.2d 559</cross_reference> (1985).

"[P]leading <italic>and</italic> proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to a trial court's jurisdiction over the subject matter of an administrative appeal." (Emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Harris v. Zoning Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>259 Conn. 402</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>409</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>788 A.2d 1239</cross_reference> (2002). "Aggrievement is an issue of fact . . . and credibility is for the trier of the facts." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Quarry Knoll II Corp. v.

Neighborhood Properties, LLC allege that they are aggrieved by the decision of the defendant Board.

General Statutes § <cross_reference>8-8</cross_reference>(a)(1) provides, in part, that "`aggrieved person' includes any person owning land that abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board." Neighborhood Properties, LLC offered a map showing proximity to the subject property owner. In addition, at the time of trial, a deed was submitted into evidence evincing the ownership interest of Neighborhood Properties, LLC. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit A.) Accordingly, the court finds that Neighborhood Properties, LLC has pleaded and proven aggrievement.

General Statutes § <cross_reference>8-8</cross_reference>(b) provides that "[an] appeal shall be commenced by service of process in accordance wit subsections (f) and (g) of this section within fifteen days from the date that notice of the decision was published as required by the General Statutes."

General Statutes § <cross_reference>8-8</cross_reference>(f) provides that "[s]ervice of legal process for an appeal under this section shall be directed to a proper officer and shall be made by leaving a true and attested copy of the process with, or at the usual place of abode of, the chairman or clerk of the board and by leaving a true and attested copy with the clerk of the municipality."

Neighborhood Properties, LLC alleges that notice of the decision with respect to the application was published on July 3, 2003 (Appeal, ¶ 17). This appeal was commenced by service of process on the proper parties on July 13, 2003. Accordingly, this appeal was commenced in a timely manner.

"The Superior Court's scope of review is limited to determining only whether the Board's actions were unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal." <italic>RR Pool  Patio, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Appeals,</italic><cross_reference>257 Conn. 456</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>470</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>778 A.2d 61</cross_reference> (2001). "It is well settled that a court, in reviewing the actions of an administrative agency, is not permitted to substitute its judgment for that of the agency or to make factual determinations on its own." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic>

"When a zoning agency has stated its reasons for its actions, a court should not reach beyond those stated purposes to search the record for other reasons supporting the commission's decision . . . Rather, the court should determine only whether the assigned grounds are reasonably supported by the record and whether they are pertinent to the considerations which the authority was required to apply under the zoning regulations." (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Harris v. Zoning</italic><italic>Commission, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>259 Conn. 420</cross_reference>. CT Page 18839

In the present appeal, the Board granted the special permit.

"A special permit allows a property owner to use his property in a manner expressly permitted by the local zoning regulations . . . The proposed use, however, must satisfy standards set forth in the zoning regulations themselves as well as the conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Heithaus</italic><italic>v. Planning  Zoning Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>258 Conn. 205</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>215-16</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>779 A.2d 750</cross_reference> (2001). A special permit application "seeks permission to vary the use of a particular piece of property from that for which it is zoned, without offending the uses permitted as of right in the particular zoning district." <italic>Id.,</italic> 216. "When a special permit is issued, the affected property may be allowed an exception to the underlying zoning regulations, but it continues to be governed in the same manner as provided in the overall comprehensive plan." <italic>Id.,</italic> 217. When deciding "upon an application for a special permit, a planning and zoning [commission] acts in an administrative capacity . . . [Its] function . . . [is] to decide within prescribed limits and consistent with the exercise of [its] legal discretion, whether a particular section of the zoning regulations applies to a given situation and the manner in which it does apply." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic>

<center>                                   V.</center><center>                               <italic>Discussion</italic></center>
The Board held a public hearing on June 10, 2003. (ROR, Ex. 19.) The applicant's attorney made the following points: the Credit Union is located at 205 Orange Street; it is community-based and it serves 10 drive-in customers per day; the Credit Union has a written guarantee for four parking spaces. (ROR, Ex. 19.)

Attorney Marjorie Shansky appeared and represented Neighborhood Properties, LLC, Lincoln-Bradley Association and Thomas Corville. She introduced a letter signed by Francesco Garguilo, which contains an opinion that a credit union is not a permitted use. Other speakers spoke in opposition.

Following the hearing, the application was referred to the City Plan Commission. The City Plan Commission reported approval on June 18, 2003 as follows: "Professional Government and Service CT Page 18840 office is permitted as-of-right in an RO zone as noted in the residential use table below." (ROR, Ex. 12.)

Specifically, the advisory report provided that the "central issue before the Commission is the concept of joint-use parking in conjunction with the adjoining Credit Union and neighboring buildings. That is, the Commission notes the proposed restaurant at 95-107 Whitney Avenue is considering the same rear parking lot to satisfy their parking requirement. Still, the Commission observes the credit union use is less intensive than the existing medical uses currently employed in 65 Trumbull Street. The average duration of a stay of a credit union customer is below that of a physician's patient. Moreover the credit union business hours are likely shorter than the current uses at 65 Trumbull Street. With that understood, the Commission asserts the proposed joint use parking will meet the requirements of the ordinance for the two or more uses involved at the tine when such uses are in operation, and therefore recommends approval." Adopted June 18, 2003. Patricia King, Chair; Attest: Karyn M. Gilvarg, AIA, Executive Director. (ROR, Ex. 12.)

The Board held a special meeting on June 25, 2003. The Board took into account the advisory report of the City Plan Commission.

The minutes of that meeting reflect that Murray Trachten was replaced by Cathy Weber, and "the Board found that sufficient parking exists at #61 (Trumbull Street) so that both uses possess sufficient spaces to meet the criteria set forth in the ordinance. The Board found that granting this application was consistent with public convenience and welfare, traffic would not be adversely affected, and the relief would enhance present and future development in the area. The Board voted 5-0 to approve." (ROR, Ex. 17.)

The Board notified the Credit Union by letter dated July 2, 2003. (ROR, Ex. 16.)

The only matter in dispute is whether the proposed use is allowed under the regulations. In his letter of June 10, 2003, Francesco Garguilo, New Haven's Zoning Administrator, stated that he did not find a credit union to be in compliance with Section 17 (Residential Office) RO zone. (ROR, Ex. 9.)

The City Plan Commission's advisory report, however, expressly CT Page 18841 found that a Federal Credit Union is permitted as-of-right in an RO zone as a "Professional, Government and Service office." (ROR, Ex. 12.) The Board adopted the City Plan Commission's report.

"It is well established that a city's charter is the fountainhead of municipal powers . . . <italic>Lombardi v. Bridgeport,</italic><cross_reference>194 Conn. 601</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>604</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>483 A.2d 1092</cross_reference> (1984)." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Cilley v. Lamphere,</italic> <cross_reference>206 Conn. 6</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>12</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>535 A.2d 1305</cross_reference> (1988). As pertains to the City Plan Commission, the Charter of the City of New Haven reads, in part: "Sec. 182. Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration as to the character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses."

In addition, New Haven's zoning regulations expressly set forth the respective duties of the Board and the City Plan Commission. Specifically, § 63.D of the regulations authorizes the Board to grant special exceptions. Section 63.D.6 specifies, however, that, in certain types of special exception cases, the Board "shall, following its hearing, refer the case including all exhibits to the City Plan Commission, which shall submit an advisory report . . . This report of the City Plan Commission shall be taken into account in the decision of the Board."

In the present appeal, the record reflects that the City Plan Commission found that the Credit Union was classified as a Professional, Government and Service office and that it was "permitted as-of right in an RO zone . . ."; (ROR, Ex. 12); and the record further reveals that "in coming to its decision, the Board of Zoning Appeals" <italic>did</italic> take the advisory report of the City Plan Commission into account. (ROR, Ex. 46.)

The record also contains an opinion letter sent from the Zoning Administrator to the plaintiffs' attorney in which he determined that credit agencies were categorized as "financial services" pursuant to § 42J. (ROR, Ex. 9.) In the letter, the Zoning Administrator emphasized that he did "<italic>not</italic> find a credit union, as proposed for 61-65 Trumbull Street to be in compliance with Section 17 (Residential-Office) RO zone of the New Haven Zoning Ordinance"; (ROR, Ex. 9); but he further stated in the letter that it was not his "intention to invalidate any special exception application." (ROR, Ex. 9.)<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> In any event, as stated above, the regulations expressly invest the <italic>Board</italic> with the authority to review a special exception application and to render a decision upon the application after reviewing a City CT Page 18842 Plan Commission's advisory report.

Section 63.D.3 authorizes the Board to grant a special exception if it is "in accord with the public convenience and welfare." This court is satisfied that there is sufficient record evidence to support the Board's decision in this regard.

During the public hearing on the application, the Board chairperson represented that the "Board members [had] visited all the sites." (ROR, Ex. 19, p. 3.) Also during the public hearing, the Credit Union's representative distinguished the Credit Union's traffic volume from that of a larger banking concern by emphasizing that "the difference between the Bank of Boston and this credit union is that we entertain six or eight or ten drive-up customers a day rather than three or four hundred." (ROR, Ex. 19, p. 15.) Further, the Board relied upon the City Plan Commission's advisory report. (ROR, Ex. 16.) This report was based upon a site visit, and the Commission observed that "the credit union use is less intensive than the existing medical uses currently employed [at] 65 Trumbull Street." (ROR, Ex. 12.)

The court finds that the record evidence supports the Board's decision to approve the Credit Union's special exception application. Accordingly, the court dismisses this appeal.
