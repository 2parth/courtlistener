</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  On April 27, 2005, the petitioner pled guilty to one count of assault in the second degree, in violation of Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-60</cross_reference>, which carries a maximum sentence of five years incarceration, and to criminal possession of a firearm, in violation of Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-217c</cross_reference>, which carries a maximum sentence of five years incarceration. The petitioner's total exposure, therefore, was ten years incarceration. The State recommended a sentence of ten years incarceration, suspended after four and one-half years and probation for five years including special conditions and with a right to argue for a lesser sentence. On July 6, 2005, the petitioner was sentenced to a period of incarceration of five years, suspended after four and one-half years, and probation for five years on the assault second count and to five years suspended and probation for five years on the criminal possession of a firearm, to run consecutive to the other count. It is this sentence the petitioner seeks to have reviewed.

The record of this case reflects that on November 24, 2004, officers of the West Haven Police Department responded to a residence on the report that a male had been shot. Upon arrival, the officers found the victim lying on the ground being attended to by another individual. The victim told police that he had been shot by the petitioner, who is his ex-wife's son. The victim's girlfriend told police that she and the victim left her apartment and entered her vehicle. As they attempted to leave the parking lot, a vehicle blocked their way. The victim told his girlfriend that the petitioner was walking toward their car. The petitioner approached and the victim began to exit the vehicle to speak to him. The girlfriend then heard a shot and saw that the victim had been shot.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

At the hearing before the Division, the petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner's sentence is excessive because the shooting was a isolated incident and the petitioner has no history of violent behavior. The main thrust of counsel's argument, however, was that he believed the CT Page 1581 petitioner would not receive the maximum sentence per the agreement because he was told by the sentencing judge during pre-trial discussions that he would sentence the petitioner to less than four and a half years to serve. Counsel claims that he told the petitioner that he would receive less than four and one-half years. After sentencing, counsel met with the sentencing judge and, according to counsel, the sentencing judge told him that what he meant was that he would come off the four and one-half years if he felt there was a good reason. Additionally counsel complained that the petitioner did not receive adequate credit for the time he spent in jail before his plea.

The State noted at the hearing before the Division that during the canvas the petitioner was asked by the Court if any other promises had been made to him and he did not mention his counsel's claim the sentencing judge stated during pretrial discussions that he would receive less than four and one-half years. The State argued that the petitioner's sentence is reasonable in light of the fact that his pre-sentence investigation report was poor and that he is a four-time convicted felon.

Pursuant to Connecticut Practice Book § <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq., the Sentence Review Division is limited in its scope of review. The Division is to determine whether the sentence imposed "should be modified because it is inappropriate or disproportionate in the light of the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, the protection of the public interest and the deterrent, rehabilitative, isolative and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended." The Division is without authority to modify sentences except in accordance with the provisions of Connecticut Practice Book § <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq. and Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>51-194</cross_reference> et seq.

In the record of the present case, there is nothing to support the petitioner's counsel's claim that the sentencing court somehow misled him with respect to the sentence his client would receive. At the hearing before the Division, counsel acknowledged that he never placed on the record his understanding of the recommended sentence, which was obviously different than what is clearly on the record, and that is, ten years, suspended after four and one-half year and five years probation. On April 27, 2005, at the time of the plea, the recommended sentence was placed on the record and written on the docket sheet. Indeed, the special conditions of probation are also set forth in detail on the docket sheet.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> At the time of plea, counsel for the petitioner never mentioned his interpretation of the offer. Indeed, after the Court accepted the petitioner's plea, counsel never mentioned what he claims was said during pretrial discussions. Moreover, at sentencing, counsel CT Page 1582 never mentioned what he now claims the sentencing judge said during pretrial discussions. Instead, the record is clear that the sentencing judge had not made up his mind about what the appropriate sentence would be until the pre-sentence investigation was complete and until after hearing both sides at the sentencing hearing. The Court stated as follows:

<block_quote>  All right, it's a cap sentencing. I always approach these types of sentencings with an open mind. I want to give the defendant the benefit of the doubt in a cap sentencing situation like this. What I look for is a good PSI.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  I don' think this is a good PSI. It doesn't show a good employment history. It doesn't show a good history with respect to education. There's an indication that he attempted to get his GED, went to classes for a couple of months and then pulled out of those classes. Indication is that he's contesting the paternity of one, doesn't know the age of the other one.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  The statement that he gave and which is attached to the PSI — although you, Counsel, claim that this wasn't a premeditated act — seems pretty clear from Mr. Chesson's own words in the statement that is attached to a [sic] PSI, that in fact he knew what he was doing. He set out to do what he was doing, and he says that the reason that he did it was because that in his mind this was a compliance with what he calls a "street" code, a "street" code of justice. And he recognizes now that that is wrong and that he should not have acted that way.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  And to characterize a shooting as "immature," I think, is not the appropriate tag to put on that kind of conduct. It's criminal conduct; it's not immature conduct.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  I think all the factors that you raise in your argument are factors that the State took into account in both the charge — he was charged only with Assault 2—and with the cap offer that the State made, which for a shooting with injuries to CT Page 1583 the victim . . . it's a significantly lower offer than one might reasonably expect to see in a situation such as this.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  I understand that Mr. Chesson believes that he was protecting his mother. I have no doubt that his mother was involved in a violent relationship, that she was hurt by the victim in this matter. I have no doubts about any of that. And I equally have no doubts that that may have formed the motivation in some small part for what Mr. Chesson has entered his plea to here today.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  But it doesn't justify it. And it doesn't excuse it. And it doesn't, frankly, give rise to a belief that a sentence lesser than the cap should be imposed.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

If counsel for the petitioner misinterpreted comments made by the sentencing judge during pretrial discussions, he had many opportunities during the plea, after the plea, before the sentencing and after the sentencing to bring his concerns to the attention of the sentencing judge. Additionally, he could have made a motion to correct an illegal sentence. However, he did nothing of the like. Instead, he appeared before the Division and requested that it lower the petitioner's sentence because the sentencing judge did not abide by his word. However, there is simply nothing in the record to support a reduction in the petitioner's sentence.

Accordingly, after reviewing the record in its entirety, the Division finds that the sentence imposed on the petitioner on July 6, 2005 was appropriate, not disproportionate and complied with the provisions of Connecticut Practice Book § <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq.

THE SENTENCE IS AFFIRMED.
