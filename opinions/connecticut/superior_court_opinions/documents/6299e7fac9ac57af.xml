<opinion_text><unpublished>  The petitioner, Damon Mahon, was convicted after a jury trial of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53a-70</cross_reference>, and received a sentence of twenty years execution suspended after twelve years, (5 years mm); Sexual Assault in the First Degree by Accessory, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53a-70</cross_reference>(a)(1) and <cross_reference>53a-8</cross_reference>, and received fifteen years execution suspended after six years (5 years mm) consecutive to Count One; Conspiracy to Commit Sexual Assault in the First Degree, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53a-70</cross_reference>(a)(1) and <cross_reference>53a-48</cross_reference> and received twenty years execution suspended after twelve years (5 years mm) concurrent with Counts One and Two; Sexual Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53a-71</cross_reference>(a)(1) and received five years concurrent (nine months mm); Risk of Injury to a Minor, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53-21</cross_reference>(a)(2) and received five years concurrent; Kidnapping in the Second Degree, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53a-94</cross_reference>(a) and received twenty years execution suspended after eighteen years concurrent; Conspiracy to Commit Kidnapping in the Second Degree, in violation of C.G.S. <cross_reference>53a-94</cross_reference>(a) and<cross_reference>53a-48</cross_reference>(a), the Count Seven conspiracy merged with Count Three. The total effective sentence is thirty-five years execution suspended after eighteen years, with ten years probation. It is from this sentence the petitioner seeks review.

On August 1, 2002, the thirteen-year-old female victim had walked her boyfriend to a bus and was walking back on foot when she accepted a ride with the seventeen-year-old petitioner and Oraine Duncan. They drove past the victim's cousin's home and to a field where the petitioner removed the victim's clothing by force. Both boys had vaginal intercourse with the victim against her will and then drove her home. The petitioner gave three versions of events to police, but denied sexual intercourse with the victim. The co-defendant fled the country.

Counsel for the petitioner argued his client may have succumbed to peer pressure, although he agrees his client did drive the car. He was working for several years prior to this incident and possesses a strong CT Page 8278 work ethic. He will be deported at the conclusion of this sentence. The petitioner has strong family values. Counsel respectfully requests a reduction in the sentence.

The state countered by indication this was a very serious incident. The state agrees the co-defendant had sexual intercourse first, but this does not mitigate the seriousness of the act. The state believes the sentence is a little light, but within the acceptable range.

Pursuant to Connecticut Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq., the Sentence Review Division is limited in the scope of its review. The Division is to determine whether the sentence imposed "should be modified because it is inappropriate or disproportionate in light of the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, the protection of the public interest and the deterrent, rehabilitative, isolative and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended."

The Division is without authority to modify a sentence except in accordance with the provisions of Connecticut Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq., and Connecticut General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>51-194</cross_reference> et seq.

Although the petitioner was only seventeen at the time of the sexual assault, the act was violent and devastating to a thirteen-year-old victim. There are no excuses that justify such an act. Ultimately, the petitioner must be held accountable for such an unsolicited act of violence. Peer pressure can never be an excuse for such behavior, regardless of the petitioner's age.

In reviewing the record as a whole, the Division finds that the sentencing Court's actions were in accordance with the parameters of Connecticut Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq.

The sentence imposed was neither inappropriate or disproportionate.

The sentence is <italic>AFFIRMED</italic>.
