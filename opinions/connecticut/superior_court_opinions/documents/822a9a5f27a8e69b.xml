The Statewide Grievance Committee (the Committee) brought the instant presentment, pursuant to Practice Book § <cross_reference>2-41</cross_reference><footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>, against the respondent, Stuart Rothenberg, as a result of his conviction for income tax evasion, in violation of <cross_reference>26 U.S.C. § 7201</cross_reference>. Rothenberg pled guilty to a one count Information which alleged that during the 1994 calendar year he prepared and signed a false and fraudulent tax return which substantially under-reported his actual income.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Specifically, he failed to report income earned from rental properties in the sum of $85,290 for the three year period which had a total tax liability of $10,289.16. On April 24, 2000, Chief United States District Judge Covello sentenced Rothenberg to a two year period of probation, a $10,000 fine and a special assessment of $50.

The Committee has requested this court to impose a suspension for at least the term of the probation as the final discipline. In support thereof, the Committee refers to certain factors set forth in the American Bar Association's Standards for Lawyer Sanctions,<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> as well as to common law precedent. The respondent acknowledges that a suspension is the appropriate discipline, but argues that these standards and case law require a minimum suspension period.

The respondent argues that the conduct did not involve the representation of a client and that he has always represented his clients diligently and faithfully. Indeed, this court heard from nine witnesses who praised Rothenberg's professional skills, his integrity and his compassion. One other client submitted a letter and stated, inter alia, "I cannot say enough about this giving and fine attorney."

Rothenberg testified that his acts were stupid, he "felt rotten" and that this incident had torn his family apart. He testified that during CT Page 8951 this time period office records were stolen and when the records were compiled he paid the taxes. He also commented that the discipline imposed should have a semblance of proportionality. On cross examination, he could not answer whether he had notified the Massachusetts or New York Bar Associations of this conviction<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> because he turned this task over to his attorney. When asked about this issue a second time, he stated: "Let me repeat myself; I turned this over to my attorney." Finally, when asked whether he knew if his attorney had contacted the above mentioned associations, he responded in the negative.

The respondent also acknowledged that he received a reprimand in 1997 and while the substance was not addressed at the hearing, the respondent produced his father, who is also his law partner, as a witness to testify as to why he had not appealed. He indicated that his son wanted to appeal, but that he failed to file within the statutory time period.

"`An attorney as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him. His admission is upon the implied condition that his continued enjoyment of the right conferred is dependent upon his remaining a fit and safe person to exercise it, so that when he, by misconduct in any capacity, discloses that he has become or is an unfit or unsafe person to be entrusted with the responsibilities and obligations of an attorney, his right to continue in the enjoyment of his professional privilege may and ought to be declared forfeited. . . . Therefore, [i]f a court disciplines an attorney, it does so not to mete out punishment to an offender, but [so] that the administration of justice may be safeguarded and the courts and the public protected from the misconduct or unfitness of those who are licensed to perform the important functions of the legal profession.'"<underline>Doe v. Statewide Grievance Committee</underline>, <cross_reference>240 Conn. 671</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>684-85</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>694 A.2d 1218</cross_reference> (1997), quoting <underline>Massameno v. Statewide Grievance Committe</underline>,<cross_reference>234 Conn. 539</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>554-55</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>663 A.2d 317</cross_reference> (1995).

As the duty violated is clear and there is no relevant evidence concerning Mr. Rothenberg's mental state at the time, this court must first focus on the aggravating factors of § 9.22 and the mitigating factors of § 9.32. In terms of aggravating factors, it is clear that there is one prior disciplinary action, there is evidence of a selfish motive and there is a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses of under-reporting over a three year period. Having been an active member of the bar for fifteen years, Rothenberg surely has substantial experience in the practice of law. Finally, in his plea agreement, he stipulated that he "willfully subscribed and filed . . . three tax returns . . . CT Page 8952 knowing that each of the returns failed to report income he. received from the rental properties . . .

There is, however, evidence of mitigating factors including prompt restitution, a history of clear dedication and devotion to clients and a record of pro bono representation. While Rothenberg testified as to his remorse, his testimony left some ambiguity on this issue. Finally, while this conduct did not involve the practice of law, it must be remembered that in <underline>Statewide Grievance Committee v. Presnick</underline>, <cross_reference>18 Conn. App. 316</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>324</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>559 A.2d 220</cross_reference> (1989), the Appellate Court held that "[i]t is firmly established that misconduct of an attorney, whether it be in the practice of the profession or in matters dehors the practice of law, justifies discipline, including exclusion from the bar." See also <underline>In re Peck</underline>,<cross_reference>88 Conn. 447</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>450-51</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>91 A. 274</cross_reference> (1914).

The balancing of these factors is helpful, yet not dispositive of this analysis. In <underline>Statewide Grievance Committee v. Hochberg</underline>, Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. 575688 (July 12, 1999), this court addressed a fairly similar case in which the attorney was presented as a result of a federal conviction and still serving his term of probation. This court reviewed a number of decisions that imposed a suspension for the period of the probation and found that reinstatement while an attorney is serving his sentence is imprudent. Further, this court noted that in <underline>In re Culpepper</underline>, <cross_reference>770 F. Sup. 366</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>373</cross_reference> (E.D. Mich. 1991), the court articulated that "[a]lthough the Court was impressed with Mr. Culpepper's testimony and sincerity concerning his contrition and rehabilitation, as well as the testimony of other witnesses at the hearing regarding his competence and learning in the law, the Court finds that his resumption to the practice of law before this Court before he has completed his term of parole on the sentence of incarceration . . . would be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the Federal Bar." That court further added, "[a]t a time such as the present when the ethics and practices of the legal profession are under intense public scrutiny and criticism, it seems to this Court inappropriate to reinstate to the practice of law an attorney who is still serving a sentence of incarceration imposed by this Court. . . . In this Court's view, it would be a disservice to the public, to the practicing bar and this Bench to effectively say that, although a person is legally disabled, by virtue of his criminal conviction status, from serving as a juror, it is acceptable for him to serve as an officer of this court." Id., 374.

Most recently in <underline>Statewide Grievance Committee v. Mercer-Falkoff</underline>, Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 404805 (March 17, 2000, <italic>Silbert, J.</italic>), the court rendered a similar opinion and imposed suspension for the term of the federal sentence. There is no reason in this case to depart from this policy. CT Page 8953

Accordingly, Rothenberg shall be suspended for the period of his federal probation or until April 24, 2002. In addition to complying with the provisions of Practice Book § <cross_reference>2-53</cross_reference>, Rothenberg shall also attend and successfully complete an approved course on legal ethics.

</unpublished></opinion_text><unpublished><footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Practice Book § <cross_reference>2-41</cross_reference> states:

(a) An attorney shall send to the statewide bar counsel written notice of his or her conviction in any court of the United States, or the District of Columbia, or of any state, territory, commonwealth or possession of the United States of a serious crime as hereinafter defined within ten days of the entry of the judgment of conviction. That written notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.

(b) The term "conviction" as used herein refers to the disposition of any charge of a serious crime as hereinafter defined resulting from either a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or from a verdict after trial or otherwise, and regardless of the pendency of any appeal.

(c) The term "serious crime" as used herein shall mean any felony as defined in the jurisdiction in which the attorney was convicted.

(d) The written notice required by subsection (a) of this section shall include the name and address of the court in which the judgment of conviction was entered, the date of the judgment of conviction, and the specific section of the applicable criminal or penal code upon which the conviction is predicated.

(e) Upon receipt of the written notice of conviction the statewide bar counsel shall obtain a certified copy of the attorney's judgment of conviction, which certified copy shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against that attorney on the basis of the conviction. Upon receipt of the certified copy of the judgment of conviction, the statewide bar counsel shall file a presentment against the attorney with the superior court for the judicial district wherein the attorney maintains an office for the practice of law in this state, except that, if the attorney has no such office, the statewide bar counsel shall file it with the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford. The sole issue to be determined in the presentment proceeding shall be the extent of the final discipline to be imposed, provided that the presentment proceeding instituted will not be brought to hearing until all appeals from the conviction are concluded unless the attorney requests that the matter not be deferred. The statewide bar counsel shall also apply to the court for an order of immediate interim suspension, which application shall contain the CT Page 8954 certified copy of the judgment of conviction. The court may in its discretion enter an order immediately suspending the attorney pending final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding predicated upon the judgment of conviction. Thereafter, upon good cause shown, the court may, in the interest of justice, set aside or modifiy the interim suspension. Whenever the court enters an order suspending or disbarring an attorney pursuant to this section, the court may appoint a trustee, pursuant to Section 2-64, to protect the client's and the attorney's interests.

(f) If an attorney suspended solely under the provisions of this section demonstrates to the court that the underlying judgment of conviction has been vacated or reversed, the court shall vacate the order of interim suspension and place the attorney on active status. The vacating of the interim suspension shall not automatically terminate any other disciplinary proceeding then pending against the attorney.

(g) An attorney's failure to send the written notice required by this section shall constitute misconduct.

(h) No entry fee shall be required for proceedings hereunder.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> This court notes that while the Information only refers to the 1994 calendar year, the plea agreement entered into evidence states that the under-reporting actually occurred from 1992 through 1994.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> While they have not been officially adopted as rules by the Judges of the Superior Court, the American Bar Association's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions have frequently been utilized in determining the appropriate discipline. Our Supreme Court recently noted their usefulness in <underline>Statewide Grievance Committee v. Spirer.</underline> <cross_reference>247 Conn. 762</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>782</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>725 A.2d 948</cross_reference> (1999); see also <underline>Statewide Grievance Committee v.</underline><underline>Shluger.</underline> <cross_reference>230 Conn. 668</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>673</cross_reference> n. 10, <cross_reference>646 A.2d 781</cross_reference> (1994). Section 3.0 of the Standards states that "[i]n imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, a court should consider the following factors: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer's mental state; and (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors." Section 9.1 of the Standards states that "[a]fter misconduct has been established, aggravating and mitigating circumstances may be considered in deciding what sanction to impose." The § 9.22 aggravating factors include:

(a) prior disciplinary offenses;

(b) dishonest or selfish motive; CT Page 8955

(c) a pattern of misconduct;

(d) multiple offenses;

(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;

(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;

(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;

(h) vulnerability of victim;

(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;

(j) indifference to making restitution;

(k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.

The § 9.32 mitigating factors include:

(a) absence of a prior disciplinary record;

(b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;

(c) personal or emotional problems;

(d) timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct;

(e) full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings;

(f) inexperience in the practice of law;

(g) character or reputation;

(h) physical disability;

(i) mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse when:

(1) there is medical evidence that the respondent is affected by a CT Page 8956 chemical dependency or mental disability;

(2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct;

<block_quote>      (3) the respondent's recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of a successful rehabilitation; and</block_quote>

(4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that misconduct is unlikely;

(j) delay in disciplinary proceedings;

(k) imposition of other penalties or sanctions;

(l) remorse;

(m) remoteness of prior offenses.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> The Connecticut Practice Book, § <cross_reference>2-41</cross_reference> (a), requires an attorney to notify the statewide bar counsel of a conviction in any court of a serious crime within ten days of the entry of judgment of conviction. Likewise, in Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court Rules § 12(8) states that "[w]ithin ten days of a lawyer's conviction of a crime, as defined in subsection 12(1) of this rule, the lawyer shall notify the bar counsel of the conviction."</footnote_body>
