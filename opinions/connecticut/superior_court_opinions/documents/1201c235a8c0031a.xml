<opinion_text><unpublished>  Selena L. was born on February 22, 2007. On June 29, 2007, the court (Schimelman, J.) found that Selena was suffering from serious physical illness, or in immediate physical danger from her surroundings, and vested the temporary care and custody of Selena in the Department of Children and Families (hereinafter department or DCF).

Mother and father were served personally. Father appeared in court with counsel on July 6, 2007 for the initial hearing. Mother failed to appear, but was reported to be in-patient at a drug treatment facility. Counsel was appointed for mother. Selena was given a court-appointed attorney, who also served as her guardian ad litem (GAL).

Father contested the order of temporary custody, and the matter was tried to the court on July 12 and 13, 2007. Mother, father, and their respective attorneys appeared for trial on July 12. On July 12, mother indicated that she was making no claim for physical custody of her daughter, and was supporting fully father's claim for physical custody. On July 13, mother appeared in court just long enough to iterate her position and to be excused due to illness. Mother did not seek a continuance. Mother's attorney participated in both days of trial.

At trial, the court heard testimony from two pediatricians, a DCF investigative worker, two lay witnesses, and father. Several exhibits were entered into evidence as well. Having considered all of the evidence, including the demeanor of the witnesses, the court makes the following findings by a fair preponderance of the evidence.

Selena was born on February 22, 2007 to Garry L. and Mandy K. Already, in her brief life, she has encountered substantial medical difficulties. She was born with a life threatening illness due to in utero exposure. This was aggressively treated with prescription medications, and is not a present danger, though she cannot be determined free of the illness for approximately one year. She was diagnosed with a heart murmur, which CT Page 17569 at present does not rise to a significant level of medical concern. She also was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), and was treated with a nasogastric (NG) tube. She was hospitalized for approximately the first two months of her life. These medical concerns, while providing a backdrop to the proceedings, are not directly in issue.

Two other medical issues are of immediate and serious concern. The first was her diagnosis of and treatment for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which she contracted while hospitalized. She has recovered, but it left her lungs in a weakened state. She is at a greater risk for infections with potentially grave medical consequences. Secondly, and primarily at present, Selena has had serious weight gain problems. Her current pediatrician diagnoses her as a failure to thrive baby. A prior pediatrician testified that he was very concerned about the baby's developmentally limited weight gain, but because of her RSV history was more conservative in his diagnosis. He described her, as of her last office visit on June 5, 2007, as being at risk for being a failure to thrive baby. He also noted that mother was distressed at this discussion and that he never saw Selena again, without explanation from either parent.

Both pediatricians expressed serious concerns over Selena's medical condition, and both said her optimal treatment called for a single, consistent caretaker in a calm, controlled environment.

The court finds that the petitioner has proven that Selena suffers from a serious physical illness. Having made this finding, the court must now turn to the question of whether continued placement outside of the home is warranted. Again, mother makes no claim for custody, but supports father's claim.

Selena's serious medical issues establish the context in which to evaluate the actions and plans of her parents.

Mother is an addict. This fact was, and is, known to father. Father alleged that mother stole father's vehicle and credit card on June 14, and drove to another town to purchase illegal drugs. Father's sole response to this act was to call mother's probation officer on June 15 to report mother's relapse and violations. On June 15 father did not call DCF. He did not go to any court to seek any order which would secure Selena's safety in his custody. He certainly knew how to do so, as he testified that he had gone to court to obtain sole physical custody from mother of their now five-year-old daughter, Selena's sister. CT Page 17570

Later, on June 15, mother was hospitalized, and father retained de facto physical custody of Selena. He took no legal action to secure Selena's custody and safety. Instead, on June 18, father allowed mother and Selena to leave his house together. They moved into the home of a casual acquaintance from the community. By this time DCF was involved with mother, and the department arranged for mother and the acquaintance to sign a voluntary service agreement, which provided that mother would be supervised with the baby at all times. Father approved of the need for this level of supervision in a telephone conversation with a DCF worker, but father never signed a service agreement. The DCF investigator made it clear to father that there was no judicial case pending, so the department could not override or interfere with either parent's legal custody rights. Father made no attempt in any court to obtain physical custody, although he had knowledge of legal avenues, as demonstrated by his custody action for Selena's sibling. Father tolerated mother's physical control of Selena until the department obtained its order of temporary custody on June 29.

All of father's inactivity regarding Selena's welfare and safety must be considered in the assessment of his planning for Selena in the event of her return.

Father acknowledged that Selena has serious health concerns. He proposes that he, his mother, his young adult daughter (if necessary), and a nonrelative provide for Selena. The key caretaker is the nonrelative. She testified that she knows father, knows his daughter is medically complex, and that she is a licensed foster mother. She was trained in emergency medical care. She has never met Selena. For unknown reasons, she has not had a foster child in her care in a year. She could not care for Selena in her own home, but lives near father and would be available on call at any hour. She would not commit to providing care for Selena if it might impact her foster care license, though why it might was never made clear to her or the court. She has a four-year-old child of her own, who would be with her in Selena's home.

All of this runs counter to the doctors' recommendations to limit Selena's exposure to other people, especially children (who are more likely to be infectious agents), and to provide Selena with consistent and non-chaotic care. Perhaps if Selena were an infant of good health, father's deficits in judgment before her removal could be excused in light of his plan, but not given her special needs. Father's plan appears cobbled together without a reasonable prospect of meeting Selena's needs, and his history of inaction or indifference does not give the court adequate confidence that he would respond appropriately CT Page 17571 to any change or difficulty.

Accordingly, the order of temporary custody is sustained. However, DCF is ordered to notify father and mother at least 48 hours in advance of any regular medical appointments, and allow them to attend. Notice of any emergency medical treatment is to be provided to parents as soon as possible. Further, father is to be given the opportunity to visit Selena at least every other day for one hour, which time shall include the opportunity to feed the child. The visits and feeding are to be observed, and should any significant medical concerns be raised, they are to be addressed with the child's pediatrician and father as soon as possible.

The matter is continued to the case status conference already scheduled for review of any other proposed reunification steps for mother and father.
