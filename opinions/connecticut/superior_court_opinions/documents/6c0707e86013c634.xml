<opinion_byline><unpublished>  CRAWFORD, JUDGE.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This is a motion to dismiss. The plaintiff brought this summary process action and alleged that the defendant breached the terms of the Occupancy Agreement (hereinafter Agreement).

The defendant moved to dismiss the action and asserted the following: a) the plaintiff does not have standing because summary process is not the appropriate action, and b) the plaintiff did not give the defendant a meaningful opportunity to cure the defect as required by the Agreement.

Sunrise Cove is a Common Interest Community. Sunrise Cove Association, Incorporated, is a corporation organized to acquire land and adjoining beach. The individual members of the corporation hold shares in the corporation and each member owns his/her residence. The defendant is a member of the corporation.

The defendant purchased the premises known as cottage #3 Sunrise Cove Road on October 9, 1986. There were several Agreements starting October 9, 1986, renewable every five years. The Association passed the most recent Agreement at the annual meeting on August 18, 2000 and the parties signed it August 24, 2001.

The Agreement stated that the members shall have the right to maintain in designated place therein the structure owned and occupied by them. The corporation leases to the member the building site or section of land on which is affixed the dwelling owned by the member. Each member of the corporation pays a proportionate share of the common expenses. The Agreement further states that any building presently erected by the member on said site shall remain the sole and separate property of the member and the corporation shall have no right title or interest in the building except as otherwise provided for in the Agreement. CT Page 3522

The Agreement also provides that any building or addition must conform to the Building Design and Planning Standards of the Corporation or the town, and, before any changes, modification or alteration to the exterior. The building plans had to first be submitted and receive written approval by a majority vote of the board. The defendant submitted building plans for renovations to the second level of the residence and The Board approved the plans. The defendant started the renovations in 2002.

The plaintiff notified the defendant, via a Default/Pretermination Notice with Right to Cure, dated August 30, 2006, that it would proceed to immediate eviction resulting in the termination of the Agreement and member rights. The plaintiff also stated in the notice that the defendant was in default of the Agreement as the rebuilt cottage deviated from the plans that the Association had approved, to wit: the second level had been built 8 1/2 inches longer/deeper than had been depicted on the approved plans.

The plaintiff initiated this summary process action and served the defendant with a Notice to Quit possession of his cottage for the following reasons:

1. Failure to comply with building design and planning standards as required by his Occupancy Agreement;

2. Failure to reconstruct his cottage in accordance with the submitted and approved plans; and

3. Failure to cure the default as stated in the notice dated August 30, 2006.

The defendant, in support of the motion to dismiss, asserted that the plaintiff did not have standing and that the plans had been approved based on the 1997 building standards in effect at the time of the approval and not the building standards approved August 19, 2005

This action involves premises located in a Common Interest Community. The plaintiff Association, whose members are shareholders in the corporation, own the land, and each member owns his/her own residence. The controversy between the parties is whether the defendant renovated his cottage in accordance with the approved plans. Additionally, there is disagreement as to the following: CT Page 3523

1. Which building standard governed the renovation (1997 or 2005); and

2. If there were a violation, what did the board require to cure (correct) the violation.

Summary process is an action brought by a landlord seeking to regain possession of the premises. The ultimate issue in a summary process action is the right to possession. "<underline>Smithland Corporation v.</underline><underline>Vernon</underline>", <cross_reference>1 Conn. App. 439</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>443</cross_reference> (1984).

The plaintiff argues that summary process is appropriate because Article XII of the Occupancy Agreement provides that if there is a default and the agreement has terminated, the corporation <underline>may</underline> enter the dwelling unit and remove all persons and personal property therefrom,<underline>either</underline> by summary process or by <underline>suitable</underline> action or proceeding at law or in equity (emphasis added).

The parties in the document titled Occupancy Agreement provided summary process as an option in the event of a default. However, an agreement by the parties to have such an option, if exercised, does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court.

Connecticut General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>47a-2</cross_reference>(b)(5) excludes from summary process, occupancy by an owner of a condominium unit. In this case, the subject premises is part of a Common Interest Community analogous to a condominium unit and not a landlord/tenant relationship. There may be other <underline>suitable</underline> actions or proceedings to resolve the dispute as to whether the renovations were done in conformity with the approved plans. However, summary process, where the plaintiff is seeking possession of the premises owned by the defendant, is not the proper action.

<center>                               <underline>CONCLUSION</underline></center>
The court has considered the arguments and reviewed the pleadings and legal Memoranda. This is a Common Interest Community where other suitable proceedings may be available to resolve the controversy. A Summary Process action under these facts and circumstances is not appropriate. Therefore the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss is granted.
