On May 16, 2011, the plaintiff, Natale Ruisi, a resident of Westport, Connecticut commenced this action by service of process on the defendant, Timothy O'Sullivan, who is employed as the executive director of the New York State Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (lawyers' fund).<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> This case is the third civil action brought in this court by this self-represented plaintiff against the same defendant in less than a year's time. In the first case, <italic>Ruisi v.</italic><italic>O'Sullivan</italic>, Docket No. FST CV 10 5013421 (<italic>Ruisi I</italic>), the plaintiff alleges the following facts. At some unknown time prior to 1999, the plaintiff was represented by the New York law firm of Richard Osserman, P.C. Attorneys associated with the Osserman law firm allegedly stole $650,000 from the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that as a result of this theft the lawyers' fund reimbursed the plaintiff $300,000<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> and this sum "was granted to plaintiff and his attorney, Stephen Fox, so that Mr. Fox could oversee the repayment plan that he submitted to the Lawyers' Fund." Furthermore, the plaintiff contends that Attorney Fox wrongfully took a $10,000 retainer and an additional $30,000 commission out of the $300,000 that the plaintiff received from the lawyers' fund. The plaintiff submitted a claim to the lawyers' fund for reimbursement of the $40,000 that went to Atty. Fox (a New York attorney). To date, the plaintiff has not been compensated by the lawyers' fund for the money that went to Attorney Fox. As a result of this conduct, the plaintiff claims the following damages in the<italic>Ruisi I</italic> complaint: (1) the lawyers' fund caused the plaintiff's Redding, Connecticut home to be foreclosed upon because it "did not allow Plaintiff's home mortgage to be paid"; (2) the lawyers' fund contributed to the 2005 death of the plaintiff's wife "attributable to stress"; (3) the plaintiff lost his "very successful" $2.5 million importing business; (4) the lawyers' fund "caused plaintiff undue emotional suffering and loss of pursuit of happiness . . . which have greatly affected plaintiff's children's tuition payments and lives CT Page 22778 . . ." and (5) because of the actions of the lawyers' fund, the plaintiff lacks "funds for appropriate burial of plaintiff's late wife, as well as her emotional stress which may have attributed to her illness."

The defendant moved to dismiss <italic>Ruisi I</italic> on June 21, 2010 on grounds of sovereign immunity and lack of personal jurisdiction under the Connecticut longarm statute. This motion to dismiss was denied by the court, Karazin, J.T.R., on July 6, 2010. Following the denial of his motion to dismiss, the defendant filed a motion to strike on July 20, 2010. In his motion to strike, the defendant stated that the plaintiff's complaint was legally insufficient because the plaintiff's claims were barred under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The defendant also argued that the Connecticut longarm statute would not allow this court to obtain personal jurisdiction over him and that the court had no personal jurisdiction because the plaintiff had not served the New York attorney general's office as is required under New York law.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> By a memorandum of decision dated November 2, 2010, the court, Karazin, J.T.R., denied the defendant's motion to strike in its entirety. On November 19, 2010, the defendant appealed the court's denial of his motion to strike to the Appellate Court. The appeal in<italic>Ruisi I</italic> is currently pending before the Appellate Court, Docket No. AC3912.

On March 7, 2011, the plaintiff filed a second case against the defendant, <italic>Ruisi v. O'Sullivan</italic>, Docket No. FST CV 11 5013596 (<italic>Ruisi II</italic>). In the <italic>Ruisi II</italic> complaint, the plaintiff alleges that he is suffering from stress and a medical condition known as a trial fibrillation. The plaintiff contends that the defendant and the lawyers' fund are responsible for the deterioration of his health "by the way they handled the different cases that come through their office." Although it is not explicitly spelled out in the<italic>Ruisi II</italic> complaint, it appears that <italic>Ruisi II</italic> arises out of the same factual background as <italic>Ruisi I</italic>. Consequently, the defendant also brought a motion to dismiss <italic>Ruisi II</italic> on March 16, 2011 on grounds of: (1) sovereign immunity; (2) the court's lack of personal jurisdiction under the Connecticut longarm statute; (3) the plaintiff's failure to serve the New York state attorney general's office and (4) the prior pending action doctrine. On May 2, 2011, the court, Karazin, J.T.R., issued a stay regarding its decision on the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the issues raised in the <italic>Ruisi I</italic>
and <italic>Ruisi II</italic> motions to dismiss were the same, and he reasoned that it would make sense to await the Appellate Court's ruling in<italic>Ruisi I</italic> in order to ensure that the resolution of the two cases was consistent. CT Page 22779

The plaintiff then proceeded to file this third case against the defendant (<italic>Ruisi III</italic>). In the complaint filed in the present action, the plaintiff alleges that due to the defendant's appointment of Attorney Fox and Attorney Fox's "mistakes in not correcting a theft," the plaintiff is in "sincere financial despair." Specifically, the plaintiff alleges in this case, <italic>inter alia</italic>, that: (1) he would be unable to attend his son's college graduation in May 2011<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> and the corresponding college related "family outings" because he could not afford a train ticket to Washington, D.C.; (2) the plaintiff's son was forced to take out several loans and hold down two jobs in order to pay for his college education and living expenses and (3) the plaintiff is not able to bury his deceased wife's remains because "even our burial plots were stolen from us."

On June 3, 2011, the defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss the<italic>Ruisi III</italic> complaint with a supporting memorandum of law. Between the motion and the memorandum the following grounds of dismissal are urged: (1) the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity; (2) the court's lack of personal jurisdiction because this case does not satisfy the requirements of the Connecticut long arm statute; (3) the plaintiff's failure to serve the out-of-state defendant properly pursuant to Connecticut and New York law and (4) the prior pending action doctrine. The defendant's motion attaches the affidavit of Daniel McDonald, of the New York State Attorney General's office which attests that the officer has not received copies of any pleadings filed by the plaintiff in this matter. At this point in time, the plaintiff has not filed any opposition papers. The plaintiff appeared at the short calendar of July 5, 2011 and was allowed to make an oral argument in opposition to the motion to dismiss and the arguments made by defendant in his written memorandum.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

<center>                               Discussion</center>
"A motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court . . . A motion to dismiss tests, <italic>inter alia</italic>, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Beecher v. Mohegan Tribe of</italic><italic>Indians of Connecticut</italic>, <cross_reference>282 Conn. 130</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>134</cross_reference> (2007). "When a . . . court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light . . . In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily CT Page 22780 implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Cogswell v.</italic><italic>American Transit Ins. Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>282 Conn. 505</cross_reference> (2007). "Any claim that the pendency of a prior suit between the same parties, for the same thing, will abate a latter suit . . . formerly could be raised by a plea in abatement . . . The plea in abatement . . . has, however, since been replaced by the motion to dismiss . . . [Accordingly], [t]he prior pending action doctrine is properly raised via a motion to dismiss . . ." (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>Pecan v. Madigan</italic>, <cross_reference>97 Conn.App. 617</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>621</cross_reference> (2006), cert. denied,<cross_reference>281 Conn. 919</cross_reference> (2007).

Because the issue of sovereign immunity and the claims of lack of<italic>in personam</italic> jurisdiction for defective service of process are presently pending before the Appellate Court in the appeal of <italic>Ruisi</italic><italic>I</italic>, this court will stay any ruling on those points, should a ruling become necessary, pending the Appellate Court decision. The court will, however, address the claim of dismissal under the doctrine of prior action pending, which was not involved in <italic>Ruisi I</italic>.

In his memorandum of law the defendant argues that the present case (<italic>Ruisi III</italic>) should be dismissed because it is virtually alike to<italic>Ruisi I</italic> and <italic>Ruisi II.</italic> Specifically, the defendant argues that the three cases feature the same parties and they are all based on the same factual background in that each of the cases is based upon a theory that the lawyers' fund is responsible for Attorney Fox's decision to take money out of the plaintiff's reward from the lawyers' fund. The defendant also contends that the ultimate goals and objectives of the three cases are the same. Although there are some differences between the facts alleged in the three lawsuits, the defendant believes that these distinctions are outweighed by the similarities in the cases. In fact, the defendant contends that the plaintiff's decision to file multiple iterations of the same lawsuit is indicative of vexatious litigation and a plan to forestall the automatic stay that remains in effect until the Appellate Court decides the defendant's appeal in<italic>Ruisi I.</italic> Accordingly, the defendant argues that the present matter should be dismissed pursuant to the prior pending action doctrine.

"[T]he prior pending action doctrine permits the court to dismiss a subsequent case that raises issues currently pending before the court. The pendency of a prior suit of the same character, between the same parties, brought to obtain the same end or object, is, at common law, good cause for abatement. It is so, because there cannot be any reason or necessity for bringing the second, and, therefore, it must be oppressive and vexatious. This is a rule of justice and equity, CT Page 22781 generally applicable, and always, where the two suits are virtually alike, and in the same jurisdiction." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Bayer v. Showmotion, Inc.</italic>,<cross_reference>292 Conn. 381</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>395-96</cross_reference> (2009). "The policy behind the prior pending action doctrine is to prevent unnecessary litigation that places a burden on our state's already crowded court dockets . . . The rule, however, is not one of unbending rigor, nor of universal application, nor a principle of absolute law . . . Accordingly, the existence of claims that are virtually alike does not, in every case, require dismissal of a complaint." (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic>, 396.

When analyzing whether the prior pending action doctrine applies, "the trial court must determine in the first instance whether the two actions are: (1) <italic>exactly</italic> alike, i.e., for the same matter, cause and thing, or seeking the same remedy, and in the same jurisdiction; (2) virtually alike, i.e., brought to adjudicate the same underlying rights of the parties, but perhaps seeking different remedies; or (3) insufficiently similar to warrant the doctrine's application. In order to determine whether the actions are virtually alike, [the trial court] must examine the pleadings . . . to ascertain whether the actions are brought to adjudicate `the same underlying rights' of the parties." (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Bayer v. Showmotion,</italic><italic>Inc.</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, <cross_reference>292 Conn. 397</cross_reference>. "If the two actions are exactly alike or lacking in sufficient similarities, the trial court has no discretion. In the former case, the court must dismiss the second action, and in the latter instance, the court must allow both cases to proceed unabated. Where the actions are virtually, but not exactly alike, however, the trial court exercises discretion in determining whether the circumstances justify dismissal of the second action."<italic>Id.</italic>, 398. "The applicability of the prior pending action doctrine does not turn on whether the two actions seek the same remedy . . . but . . . whether they are brought to adjudicate the same underlying rights." (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>Id.</italic>, 399.

After examining the complaints<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> filed by the plaintiff in the three <italic>Ruisi</italic> cases, it becomes clear that all of these actions are between the same parties and currently pending in the same jurisdiction. Although some of the damages claimed by the plaintiff in the three cases are different, all of these damages stem from the same underlying factual background, in that the plaintiff alleges that the lawyers' fund and its executive director, the defendant, should have done something to stop Attorney Fox from taking money out of the plaintiff's $300,000 award from the lawyers' fund. There are already two pending CT Page 22782 cases in which the plaintiff is seeking to vindicate his rights for the alleged wrongdoings of the defendant and the lawyers' fund, and these cases are sufficient. In fact, the only additional allegation of damages that the plaintiff makes in the present case that he has not previously alleged is that the plaintiff lacked funds to attend his son's college graduation in May 2011. The virtual identity of this <italic>Ruisi III</italic> case with the <italic>Ruisi I</italic> case is conceded by the plaintiff himself where he alleges in the <italic>Ruisi III</italic> complaint that "In no way, shape or form is Plaintiff changing his original law suit against the Lawyers' Fund, but simply asking for monetary relief to see the Plaintiff's son graduate."

The court therefore concludes that this <italic>Ruisi III</italic> case is virtually alike to the prior <italic>Ruisi I</italic> and <italic>Ruisi II</italic> cases, and should be dismissed as unnecessary litigation. If the denial of dismissal in <italic>Ruisi I</italic> is upheld on appeal, the plaintiff can move to amend the <italic>Ruisi I</italic> complaint to allege the one additional damage claim of <italic>Ruisi III</italic> relating to his son's college graduation. There is no reason why that claim should be allowed to continue in this court as a separate lawsuit.

For the foregoing reasons the defendant's motion to dismiss this action under the prior pending action doctrine is granted.
