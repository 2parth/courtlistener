On October 3, 2006, the Commissioner of the Department of Children and Families, ("DCF"), filed a petition pursuant to General Statutes ยง<cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>, et seq., to terminate the parental rights of Melissa M. and Lewis B. to their child, Maliki B. Trial of this matter took place on June 19, 2007. Respondent mother, Melissa M. failed to appear for trial and father, Lewis B. consented to a termination of his parental rights. The court (Wilson, J.) entered a default judgment against mother for her failure to appear and after canvassing father, Lewis B., the court (Taylor, J.), found by clear and convincing evidence that Lewis B.'s consent was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered with a full understanding of the legal consequences of his act and accepted Lewis B.'s consent. The original grounds for termination of Lewis B.'s parental rights was withdrawn by the petitioner and the ground of consent was substituted. On October 30, 2006, the petitioner filed a Motion to Review Permanency Plan and Maintain Commitment. The permanency plan for Maliki was termination of parental rights and adoption. On November 16, 2006 father Lewis B. objected to the permanency plan. On November 16, 2006 the court (Quinn, J.) consolidated the petitioner's Motion to Review Permanency Plan and Maintain Commitment and respondent father's objection with the termination of parental rights trial.

The trial court finds that it has proper jurisdiction of this matter, notice of the proceeding was provided, and no action is pending in any other court affecting the custody of the child.

<center>                               <italic>II. ISSUES</italic></center>
The petitioner seeks to terminate the parental rights of mother, Melissa M. on grounds that Maliki has been abandoned by Melissa within the meaning of General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(A) and, that Maliki has been found in a prior proceeding to have been neglected or uncared for CT Page 19067 and Melissa M. has failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of Maliki she could assume a responsible position in his life. General Statutes ยง<cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(B)(i). In addition, the petitioner seeks approval of the permanency plan of termination of parental rights and adoption filed on October 30, 2006.

<center>                               <italic>III. FACTS</italic></center>
The petitioner's involvement in this case dates back to the birth of Maliki on April 11, 2003 when both he and mother, Melissa tested positive for cocaine. The petitioner did not remove Maliki, and Melissa did leave the hospital with Maliki after his birth in April 2003, however pursuant to a family arrangement he was placed with maternal grandmother in May 2003. Melissa was residing with maternal grandmother at this time. Melissa's presenting issues when the petitioner initially became involved with the case were substance abuse and her untreated mental health condition. The petitioner provided services to Melissa and Maliki at this time. In July 2003, Melissa, Maliki and father Lewis B. moved into their own apartment. This did not work out and Melissa moved back into maternal grandmother's residence in October 2003. Although Melissa moved back into maternal grandmother's residence she was "in and out," however Maliki remained with maternal grandmother. The petitioner continued to provide services throughout this period of time to assist Melissa in addressing her mental health and substance abuse issues. Melissa was referred to Bristol Counseling Center, Wheeler Clinic and ADRC and Bristol Hospital for detox. Despite services, Melissa continued to abuse drugs, live transiently and not address her mental health issues. In July 2005, maternal grandmother's house was sold, after which Maliki was placed with maternal aunt. At this time, Melissa continued to engage in substance abuse, had not addressed her mental health issues and continued to live a transient lifestyle. In July 2005, the petitioner referred mother to the Hartford Dispensary methadone program. Although mother's attendance at the program was consistent she continued to regularly test positive for cocaine and heroin. On July 6, 2005, the petitioner filed a neglect petition in the interest of Maliki alleging that Maliki was neglected in that he was denied proper care and attention and was permitted to live under conditions injurious to his well being. On January 6, 2006, mother Melissa entered a nolo plea to the allegations in the neglect petition. The court (Quinn, J.), adjudicated Maliki neglected and committed him to the Department. Specific steps were also ordered for Melissa on January 6, 2006 and pursuant to same she was required, <italic>inter alia</italic>, to keep all appointments set by or with DCF; cooperate with home visits; keep whereabouts known CT Page 19068 to DCF and her respective attorney; visit Maliki as often as DCF permits and demonstrate appropriate parent/child interaction; participate in individual and group counseling; submit to a substance abuse assessment and follow recommendations regarding treatment; successfully complete substance abuse treatment and follow recommendations regarding aftercare treatment, including relapse prevention; secure and maintain adequate housing; no substance abuse and no involvement with the criminal justice system. Shortly after Maliki's adjudication and commitment to the Department in January 2006, Melissa's whereabouts became unknown to the Department and to her family. Maliki remained with his maternal aunt who at this time became a licensed foster mother. The petitioner made efforts to locate Melissa through Department of Social Services and Department of Corrections searches and criminal checks. The Department also conducted a Locator Plus check in Connecticut and in Virginia based on information that Melissa may have relocated there. In July 2006, Melissa contacted maternal aunt and spoke to Maliki on the phone. As of April 2007 she has made consistent phone contact, speaking with Maliki for approximately forty seconds each time. Melissa has made written contact with maternal aunt advising maternal aunt that she was in favor of termination of her parental rights and Maliki's permanent placement with maternal aunt. Melissa failed to appear for trial on June 19, 2007 and as of that date her whereabouts remained unknown.

From the time Maliki was committed in January 2006 to the adjudicatory date of October 3, 2006, DCF was unable to provide services to Melissa to assist her in addressing her issues because her whereabouts were unknown. DCF made efforts to locate her, however to no avail. Although Melissa has made contact with Maliki, there is no credible evidence that she has had contact with Maliki beyond the brief once a week telephone calls she has been making to him since April 2007. Melissa has not seen Maliki since January 2006, has not provided financial support for Maliki, has not sent gifts, cards or letters to him, has not acknowledged his birthday, or other special days, and has not requested visitation. There is no credible evidence that Melissa manifested a continuing, reasonable degree of interest and concern in Maliki by expressing concern over the health, education and general well-being of Maliki. Melissa has not provided the necessary food, clothing, medical care, adequate housing and social and religious guidance to Maliki.

Maliki was born on April 11, 2003 and is four years and three months old. Maliki is a sweet, happy, outgoing and precocious little boy who loves his fire trucks, video games, playing on his swing set and with the three family dogs. He continues to thrive under the care, love and guidance of his foster mother/maternal aunt, Michelle M. and maternal uncle, Michael M., with whom he has lived since July 2005. Maliki has CT Page 19069 adjusted well and has a very strong bond with his aunt and uncle who he refers to as "mommy" and "daddy." He looks to both maternal aunt and uncle for nurturing and support and to meet all of his physical and emotional needs. Maliki has no physical health problems and is medically up to date. He attends pre-kindergarten in the morning and daycare in the afternoons two days per week and daycare all day three days per week. Maliki's teachers report that he is excelling in all that he does and that his classmates look to him as a leader.

Maternal aunt owns a single-family home in which Maliki has his own bedroom. The home is clean, well kept and appropriate for Maliki. Maternal aunt and uncle are fully committed to providing Maliki with a loving, nurturing, caring, structured and permanent environment. Both maternal aunt and uncle want to adopt Maliki.

Respondent father, Lewis B. has consented to the termination of his parental rights of Maliki and the consent has been accepted by the court. The petitioner moved to amend the petition to the consensual ground without objection. The motion was granted. No findings, are, therefore, necessary to be made with respect to father.

"`Termination of parental rights' means the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and the child's parent or parents so that the child is free for adoption. . ." General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>45a-707</cross_reference>(8). "[I]t is both a fundamental right and the policy of this state to maintain the integrity of the family. Where a fundamental right is involved, the burden of proof is always on the party seeking to interfere with that right." <italic>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD</italic>),<cross_reference>189 Conn. 276</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>295</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>455 A.2d 1313</cross_reference> (1983). "[T]ermination of a parent's rights to his or her children was unknown to the common law." <italic>In re Eden F.</italic>,<cross_reference>48 Conn.App. 290</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>321</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>710 A.2d 771</cross_reference> (1998), rev'd on other grounds,<cross_reference>250 Conn. 674</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>741 A.2d 873</cross_reference> (1999). The statutes creating procedures for the termination of parental rights are in derogation of common law.<italic>Id.</italic> Without the existence of such state statutes, the power of a juvenile court to terminate parental rights would not exist.<italic>Id.</italic> "The rights of children to protection from harm and to placement in a nurturing environment are core values of our society. So too, is the right of parents to raise their children without undue government interference . . . Since the severance by the state of a parent-child relationship implicates fundamental rights and the termination of a CT Page 19070 parent's rights is a creature of statute, it is essential that a parental termination can be decreed only in both strict and literal compliance with the applicable state statutes." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>In re Shaiesha O.</italic>, <cross_reference>93 Conn.App. 42</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>43</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>887 A.2d 415</cross_reference>
(2005).

General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j) imposes upon DCF the clear and convincing evidence standard for the burden of proof. "In order to terminate rights under ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>, the petitioner is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunify the family; General Statutes ยง<cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(1); (2) termination is in the best interest of the child; General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(2); and (3) there exists any one of the seven grounds for termination delineated in ยง 17a-112(j)(3)." <italic>In re</italic><italic>Samantha C.</italic>, <cross_reference>268 Conn. 614</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>628</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>847 A.2d 883</cross_reference> (2004).

<center>             <italic>1. Reasonable Efforts to Locate and Reunify. ยง</italic><italic>17a-112(j)(1</italic>)</center>
For a child in the custody of DCF, the first requisite for termination of parental rights is the exhaustion of reasonable efforts by DCF to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent. General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(1). "[Section <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(1)] imposes on the department the duty, <italic>inter alia</italic>, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department's efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word effort is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn . . . [R]easonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible." <italic>In re Samantha C., supra</italic>,<cross_reference>268 Conn. 632</cross_reference>. Section <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(1) does not contemplate that the trial court will rely upon the judicial findings in an earlier proceeding that reunification efforts have been appropriate. The trial court considering the petition for termination of parental rights must make its own determination based upon evidence presented at trial. Here, no such finding was made as to respondent mother, Melissa.

Pursuant to ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(1), the court need not make a finding that DCF made reasonable efforts to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, except that such finding is not required if a court has previously determined at a permanency plan hearing that such efforts at reunification were no longer appropriate. General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(1). Such finding was CT Page 19071 not made by the court as to respondent mother, Melissa at the permanency plan hearing held on November 16, 2006. Here, Melissa's whereabouts have been unknown since January 2006. DCF has made efforts to locate Melissa through the Department of Social Services and the Department of Corrections. A criminal check was also performed in addition to a Locator Plus search in Connecticut and Virginia. Despite DCF's efforts to locate Melissa, her whereabouts have remained unknown since January 2006 through the date of trial. The court therefore finds by clear and convincing evidence that reasonable efforts to reunify Maliki with respondent mother Melissa were not possible since her whereabouts have been unknown since January 2006.

<center>                        <italic>2. Adjudicatory Findings</italic></center>
"To justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent, one or more of the grounds set forth in General Statutes ยง [17a-112(j)(3)] must be proven by clear and convincing evidence." <italic>In re</italic><italic>Michael M.</italic>, <cross_reference>29 Conn.App. 112</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>118</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>614 A.2d 832</cross_reference> (1992). "In contrast to custody proceedings, in which the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration and in fact, usually dictate the outcome in termination proceedings, the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings can begin. No all encompassing best interests standard vitiates the requirement of compliance with the statutory criteria." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>In re Antonio M.</italic>, <cross_reference>56 Conn.App. 534</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>538</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>744 A.2d 915</cross_reference> (2000). There must be "strict compliance with the statutory criteria [of ยง<cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)] before termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption proceedings can occur." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-BC</italic>), <cross_reference>194 Conn. 252</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>257</cross_reference>, n. 9, <cross_reference>479 A.2d 1204</cross_reference>
(1984).

The statutory grounds upon which the petitioner relies to terminate the parental rights of respondent mother Melissa are that Maliki was abandoned by respondent mother in the sense that she has failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest concern or responsibility as to the welfare of Maliki, General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(A), and that Maliki was found to be neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding and respondent mother failed to rehabilitate within the meaning of General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(B)(i).

The petitioner claims that the respondent mother of Maliki has abandoned him. "Abandonment focuses on the parent's conduct . . . A lack of interest in the child is not the sole criterion in determining abandonment, General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(A) defines abandonment as the fail[ure] to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or CT Page 19072 responsibility as to the welfare of the child . . . Attempts to achieve contact with a child, telephone calls, the sending of cards and gifts, and financial support are indicia of interest, concern or responsibility for the welfare of a child . . . Abandonment occurs where a parent fails to visit a child, does not display love or affection for the child, does not personally interact with the child, and demonstrates no concern for the child's welfare . . . Section <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(A) does not contemplate a sporadic showing of the indicia of interest, concern or responsibility for the welfare of a child. A parent must maintain a reasonable degree of interest in the welfare of his or her child. Maintain implies a continuing, reasonable degree of concern. The commonly understood general obligations of parenthood entail these minimum attributes: (1) express love and affection for the child; (2) express personal concern over the health, education and general well-being of the child; (3) the duty to supply the necessary food, clothing, and medical care; (4) the duty to provide an adequate domicile; and (5) the duty to furnish social and religious guidance." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>In re</italic><italic>Jermaine S.</italic>, <cross_reference>86 Conn.App. 819</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>839-40</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>863 A.2d 720</cross_reference> (2005); <italic>In re Deana</italic><italic>E.</italic>, <cross_reference>61 Conn.App. 185</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>193</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>763 A.2d 37</cross_reference> (2000).

Respondent mother Melissa has not seen Maliki since January 2006. Melissa has not visited Maliki, has not provided financial support, and despite her telephone contact with Maliki in July 2006 and weekly contact as of April 2007 she has not maintained a reasonable degree of interest and concern for Maliki's welfare. She has made no inquiries about his health, education or general wellbeing. She has not supplied him with food, clothing or medical care, she has failed to maintain adequate housing and has not furnished social and religious guidance to Maliki. The evidence is clear and convincing that respondent mother Melissa has abandoned him.

The petitioner also claims that Melissa's rights to Maliki should be terminated because "[Maliki] has been found by the Superior Court to have been neglected or uncared for in a prior proceeding . . . and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take and facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant to section<cross_reference>46b-129</cross_reference> and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child." General Statutes ยง<cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(B)(i). As Maliki has been found to be neglected in a prior proceeding, the question to be determined is whether Melissa has achieved such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of Maliki, Melissa could assume a responsible position in his life. The CT Page 19073 court finds in favor of the petitioner on this ground.

"`Personal rehabilitation' as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent . . . [Section <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent's] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. [The statute] requires the court to find by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation that [Melissa has] achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date [she] can assume a responsible position in [Maliki's] life." <italic>In re Eden</italic><italic>F.</italic>, <cross_reference>250 Conn. 674</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>706</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>741 A.2d 873</cross_reference> (1999). The clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that between January 6, 2006, the date Maliki was committed to the Department, and the adjudicatory date of October 3, 2006, Melissa M. failed to achieve the level of rehabilitation that would encourage the belief that she could assume a responsible position in Maliki's life, given his age and needs, in the near future. Maliki tested positive for cocaine when he was born on April 11, 2003. The Department did not remove Maliki from the care and custody of his mother at that time but agreed that Maliki would be placed with his maternal grandmother. Melissa was residing with her mother at this time. Also during this time, DCF referred mother to Bristol Counseling Center, Wheeler Clinic and the Hartford Dispensary. Melissa failed to follow through with these services for treatment. In July 2005, Maliki was placed with his maternal aunt and maternal uncle because maternal grandmother sold her home. Services were provided to mother in 2005, however she failed to follow through with these services. On January 6, 2006 Maliki was adjudicated neglected and committed to the care and custody of the petitioner. He remained placed with his maternal aunt who later became his foster mother and who now wants to adopt him. Specific steps were ordered for mother at this time. Respondent mother became whereabouts unknown to the Department very shortly after Maliki was adjudicated neglected and committed to the petitioner. Between the time Maliki was committed to the petitioner in January 2006 and the adjudicatory date of October 2006, the Department was unable to provide services to Melissa due to her unknown whereabouts. The Department made efforts to locate Melissa through the Department of Corrections, the Department of Social Services, criminal checks and a Locator Plus search in Connecticut and Virginia. Despite DCF's efforts to locate Melissa, her whereabouts have remained unknown since January 2006 through the date of trial. Thus, the clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that DCF has been unable to provide services to Melissa due to her unknown whereabouts. Melissa's unknown whereabouts also demonstrates that she is unwilling to engage in the necessary treatment to address her issues so CT Page 19074 that she can care for Maliki. The evidence is clear and convincing that Melissa M. has failed to rehabilitate herself to the level that would encourage the belief that she could assume a responsible position in Maliki's life given his age and needs.

The statutory framework of ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(B)(i) requires the court to analyze the parents' rehabilitation "as it relates to the needs of the particular child" and consider if such rehabilitation is foreseeable "within a reasonable time." <italic>In re Luis C.</italic>, <cross_reference>210 Conn. 157</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>167</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>554 A.2d 722</cross_reference> (1989), <italic>In re Hector L.</italic>, <cross_reference>53 Conn.App. 359</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>366-67</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>730 A.2d 106</cross_reference>
(1999). Because of this requirement that the court predict what may happen within a "reasonable time" after the filing of the termination petition, the court must consider not only Melissa's conduct prior to the filing of the petition, but also her conduct since that time. Melissa's whereabouts have been unknown since January 2006 and remain unknown. On November 3, 2006, Melissa failed to appear for the plea on the petition for termination of her parental rights and the court on this date entered a default judgment against her for her failure to appear. Melissa also failed to appear on June 19, 2007, the day of trial. Melissa has brief one-minute telephone contacts with Maliki which began in July 2006 but was not consistent until April 2007. Thus, in its totality, given the length of time that Melissa has had to rehabilitate and make her whereabouts known so that she could receive the services needed to assist her in caring for Maliki, the clear and convincing evidence compels the conclusion that she lacks the ability to assume a responsible position in Maliki's life within a reasonably foreseeable time.

"A hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. In the adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether one of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists by clear and convincing evidence. If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase."

"In the dispositional phase of a termination of parental rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the continuation of the respondent's parental rights is not in the best interest of the child. In arriving at CT Page 19075 this decision, the court is mandated to consider and make written findings regarding seven factors delineated in [ยง 17a-112(k)]." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>In re Vanna A.</italic>, <cross_reference>83 Conn.App. 17</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>26</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>847 A.2d 1073</cross_reference> (2004). "The factors, however, serve simply as guidelines to assist the court in its determination of the child's best interest, and each factor need not be proven by clear and convincing evidence."<italic>In re Victoria B.</italic>, <cross_reference>79 Conn.App. 245</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>258-59</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829 A.2d 855</cross_reference> (2003). "The judicial authority may admit into evidence any testimony relevant and material to the issue of the disposition, including events occurring through the close of the evidentiary hearing, but no disposition may be made by the judicial authority until any mandated social study has been submitted to the judicial authority. Said study shall be marked as an exhibit subject to the right of any party to require that the author, if available, appear for cross-examination." Practice Book ยง 53a-9.

The court, after having considered all of the testimony and documentary evidence relating to the issue of disposition, and, which evidence includes events occurring through the close of the trial, makes the following findings by clear and convincing evidence:

The timeliness, nature and extent of</italic> <italic>services offered, provided and made</italic> <italic>available to the parent and the child by</italic> <italic>an agency to facilitate the reunion of the</italic> <italic>child with the parent.</italic></center>
Melissa's whereabouts have been unknown since January 2006 and therefore it was not possible for DCF to offer services to Melissa to facilitate the reunion of Maliki and Melissa. Services for respondent father were offered, however father was not cooperative with services. A substance abuse evaluation was scheduled for father at Wheeler Clinic, however father failed to attend despite having agreed to attend. A new appointment was scheduled for father, however he again failed to attend.

DCF has been unable to make reasonable efforts as to mother Melissa since her whereabouts have been unknown since January 2006 and have remained unknown through the date of trial. Specific steps were not ordered for father when pleas were entered by mother at the neglect hearing on January 6, 2006. Father failed to appear for the hearing and the court (Quinn, J.), defaulted him. DCF did however attempt to provide CT Page 19076 services to father but he failed to cooperate.

Specific steps for mother were ordered on January 6, 2006, however Melissa's whereabouts became unknown shortly after the court issued steps. She has therefore failed to comply with the court-ordered steps. Specific steps were not ordered for father on January 6, 2006 because he failed to appear for the hearing and was defaulted.

Mother and father maintained minimal contact with Maliki. He does not have positive feelings toward father. He has been speaking to respondent mother on the phone weekly since April 2007 and they talk for less than a minute. There is no credible evidence that Maliki has strong emotional ties to his mother. He refers to his biological mother as his "other mother." The clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that Maliki has strong emotional ties with his maternal aunt/foster mother and his maternal uncle who have provided the physical, emotional, educational support and quotidian nurturing he needs.

<center>                        <italic>5. The age of the child.</italic></center>
Maliki was born on April 11, 2003 and is four years and three months old. Maliki has been in the care of his maternal aunt since July 2005. He has been in foster care and placed with his maternal aunt since his commitment on January 6, 2006. Maternal aunt (foster mother) and maternal uncle plan to adopt him. Both are committed to Maliki and have demonstrated an ability to meet his needs. Foster care should be a strictly time-limited interval in the life of any child. The Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,42 U.S.C. ยง 670 et seq., as amended, envisages that after twelve months in foster care a child deserves a permanent home. Maliki has been in foster care for seventeen months. He deserves a permanent home with his maternal aunt CT Page 19077 and maternal uncle without further delay.

Mother Melissa has done nothing to adjust her circumstances to make it in the best interests of Maliki to be returned to her. Having recognized his inability to care for Maliki, and, that it is in Maliki's best interest, respondent father consented to a termination of his parental rights.

Nothing has prevented respondents from maintaining a meaningful relationship with Maliki. The lack of a meaningful relationship is not due to any unreasonable interference by DCF, foster mother, or any other third party. DCF has taken all reasonable steps to ascertain the whereabouts of mother Melissa.

<center>                            <italic>2. BEST INTERESTS</italic></center>
With respect to the best interests of the child as contemplated by General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(2), based upon all of the foregoing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the parental rights of respondent mother Melissa M. and respondent father Lewis B. is in the best interest of Maliki. Maliki is in a clean, safe, healthy and loving environment. He is developing appropriately and has no physical health problems. Maliki has bonded with his maternal aunt who is his relative foster mother and who is fully committed to him and who wants to adopt him. Maliki has also bonded with maternal uncle who also wants to adopt him. Maliki has a sense of permanency, consistency and stability with his maternal aunt and maternal uncle which is crucial for him right now.

Respondent mother's whereabouts have been unknown since January 2006 and therefore she cannot assume a responsible parental role for Maliki, CT Page 19078 and respondent father Lewis B., having recognized that he is unable to care for Maliki and that termination is in Maliki's best interest, has consented to a termination of his parental rights. In view of the fact that respondent mother, Melissa M. and respondent father, Lewis B. are not in a position to care for Maliki right now or at any reasonably foreseeable time in the future, termination of their parental rights is in Maliki's best interest.

In finding that termination of the respondents' parental rights would be in Maliki's best interest, the court has examined multiple relevant factors including his interest in sustained growth, development, well-being, stability and continuity of his environment; his length of stay in foster care; the nature of his relationship with his maternal aunt/foster mother, maternal uncle and biological parents; the degree of contact maintained with his biological parents; and his genetic bond to the respondents. <italic>In re Alexander C.</italic>, <cross_reference>60 Conn.App. 555</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>559</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>760 A.2d 532</cross_reference>
(2000); <italic>In re Shyina B.</italic>, <cross_reference>58 Conn.App. 159</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>167</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>752 A.2d 1139</cross_reference> (2000);<italic>In re Savanna M.</italic>, <cross_reference>55 Conn.App. 807</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>816</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>740 A.2d 484</cross_reference> (1999). The court has also balanced Maliki's intrinsic need for stability and permanency against the potential benefit of maintaining a connection with his biological parents. See <italic>Pamela B. v. Ment</italic>, <cross_reference>244 Conn. 296</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>314</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>709 A.2d 1089</cross_reference>
(1998) (child's physical and emotional well-being must be weighed against the interest in preserving family integrity). Under such scrutiny, the clear and convincing evidence in this matter establish that termination of respondents' parental rights is in Maliki's best interest.

With regard to permanency, the court considers the social studies and the testimony of the social worker which clearly demonstrate that Maliki has a strong bond with his maternal aunt/foster mother and maternal uncle who want to adopt him. Maliki is entitled to resolution, without delay, of the period of uncertainty as to the availability of respondents to serve as his parents by terminating respondents' parental rights. After considering Maliki's sense of time, his need for a secure and permanent environment, his need to avoid future placements, and the totality of the circumstances, the court concludes that termination of respondents' parental rights is in his best interest.

<center>                      <italic>C. REVIEW OF PERMANENCY PLAN</italic></center>
Pursuant to General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>46b-129</cross_reference>(k) and Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>35a-14</cross_reference>, on October 3, 2006 the petitioner filed a Motion to Review Permanency Plan and Maintain Commitment. In its motion, the petitioner requested the court to review and approve the plan for termination of parental rights and adoption of Maliki and maintain his commitment to the CT Page 19079 Department. The Department asserted in its motion that both were in Maliki's best interest. On November 16, 2006 at a hearing to review the permanency plan and maintain commitment, the court (Quinn, J.), found that it was in Maliki's best interest to maintain his commitment to the Department and so ordered. Respondent father objected to the permanency plan and the court consolidated the petitioner's Motion to Review Permanency Plan, father's objection and the no further efforts finding with the termination of parental rights trial.

At a hearing on the Motion for Review of Permanency Plan and to Maintain Commitment, the judicial authority shall determine by a fair preponderance of the evidence whether it is in the best interest of the child to maintain commitment. The party seeking to maintain the commitment has the burden of proof. In addition to determining whether to maintain the commitment, the judicial authority shall also determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether efforts have been made by DCF to reunify the child with the parent, whether DCF made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan, whether the proposed goal of the permanency plan is in the best interest of the child, and, whether by clear and convincing evidence efforts to reunify the child with the parent are still appropriate. DCF has the burden of proof in each determination to be made by the court. General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>46b-129</cross_reference>(k); Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>35a-14</cross_reference>.

Based upon the evidence introduced at the termination of the parental rights trial, including but not limited to, the social study and addendum submitted in support of the permanency plan of termination of parental rights and adoption, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:

1. The plan for termination of parental rights and adoption is in the best interest of Maliki and therefore approves the plan filed on October 3, 2006.

2. It is in Maliki's best interest to maintain his commitment and therefore the court grants DCF's Motion to Maintain the Commitment filed on October 3, 2006.

3. DCF made reasonable efforts to achieve the identified permanency plan of termination of parental rights and adoption.

The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

4. Continuing efforts to reunify Maliki with mother and father are not appropriate. CT Page 19080

The court overrules all objections to the permanency plans.

<center>                        <italic>V. CONCLUSION AND ORDERS</italic></center>
Based upon the aforementioned findings that have been made by clear and convincing evidence, and considering the seven factors set forth in the previous section, it is hereby <italic>ORDERED</italic> that the parental rights of respondent mother, Melissa M. because she has abandoned Maliki within the meaning of ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(A), and has failed to rehabilitate within the meaning of ยง <cross_reference>17a-112</cross_reference>(j)(3)(B)(i), and respondent father, Lewis B. because he has consented, be and hereby are terminated, and that the Commissioner of the Department of Children and Families is hereby appointed the statutory parent for the purpose of placing Maliki in adoption. A permanency plan shall be submitted within thirty days of this judgment, and such further reports shall be timely presented to the court as required by law.

Judgment may enter accordingly.

It is so <italic>ORDERED</italic> this July 31, 2007.
