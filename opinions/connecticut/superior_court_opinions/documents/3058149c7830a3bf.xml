</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The dispute between the main parties to this case extends back a number of years without any resolution on the horizon. The plaintiff R.S. Silver Enterprises Co., Inc. (Silver Enterprises) alleges in its complaint that the defendant Pascarella and Silver Enterprises entered into a "Participation Agreement" whereby Silver Enterprises invested $1,250,000 in a partnership now known as Riversedge Partners in 1997. Since that time, Silver Enterprises alleges that Riversedge and Pascarella as its managing partner have refused to recognize Silver Enterprise's status as a partner in Riversedge, have refused to provide any financial information about the partnership, have refused to provide any accounting and have excluded Silver Enterprises from any matters relating to the partnership. The complaint alleges breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks, <italic>inter alia</italic>, damages and a dissolution of Riversedge.

The defendants Pascarella and Riversedge move to dismiss the complaint on three somewhat related grounds. The grounds are that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action; second, that the matter arises out of the unauthorized conduct of business by Silver Enterprises, and third, that the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from pursuing this case.

"Pursuant to the rules of practice, a motion to dismiss is the appropriate motion for raising a lack of subject matter jurisdiction."

A.2d 90 (2003). "When a. . . court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light. . . In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the CT Page 11052 complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in manner most favorable to the pleader."

The thrust of the defendant's subject matter jurisdiction argument is that the named participant in the "Participation Agreement" was R.S. Silver  Co., a Connecticut corporation that was administratively dissolved in 1991 by the Secretary of the State. Apparently, few people knew of this dissolution and neither Robert Silver the corporation's principal, nor Pascarella, the corporation's attorney were aware. Nevertheless, the defendants contend that this action cannot be pursued by an entity that does not exist. The defendants further contend that the action taken to reinstate the corporate status on February 9, 2006 and to change the name to the present R.S. Silver Enterprise Co., Inc. is null and void because of General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-995</cross_reference> which states:

Sections <cross_reference>33-600</cross_reference> to <cross_reference>33-998</cross_reference>, inclusive, [the Connecticut Business Corporation Act] apply to all domestic corporations in existence on January 1, 1997. . .

The defendants argue that because Silver Enterprises was not in existence on January 1, 1997, it could not apply, as it did in 2006, for reinstatement pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-892</cross_reference>. This argument is not persuasive. First, General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-891</cross_reference> states that "[a] corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence. . ." Second, General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-892</cross_reference>(c) says that "[w]hen reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative dissolution never occurred." Third, the defendants' argument is directly contradicted by the amendment to Section <cross_reference>33-892</cross_reference> by the legislature in<cross_reference>Public Act 97-246</cross_reference>. That amendment deleted the words "under Section 33-890" from Section <cross_reference>33-892</cross_reference>, so that provision now reads "[a] corporation administratively dissolved may apply to the Secretary of the State for reinstatement . ." <cross_reference>P.A. 97-246</cross_reference>, Section 27(a). Prior to that amendment, the reinstatement language arguably might have applied only to corporations dissolved under the New Connecticut Business Corporation Act enacted between 1994 and 1997. The 1997 amendment made clear that this was not so, and any corporation previously dissolved could apply for reinstatement.

This court's position is substantially consistent with a Superior CT Page 11053 Court decision rendered earlier this year in <italic>Gillon v. Bysiewicz</italic>, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, CV 06 4009020 (February 21, 2007, Downey, J.). In that case, now on appeal with an Appellate Court Docket No. of AC 27879, the plaintiffs, represented by the same counsel representing Pascarella and Riversedge here, contended that the Secretary of the State had improperly reinstated R.S. Silver Co., Inc. The decision of Judge Downey relying on the briefs of the defendants therein dismissed the case.

The second argument of the defendants, that the claim of Silver Enterprises, based as it is on a "Participation Agreement" made in 1997, arises out of business which Silver Enterprises could not conduct because it was not a corporation at the time. Whatever the merits of this contention are in light of the doctrine of a <italic>de facto</italic> corporation, and in light of the provisions of General Statutes § <cross_reference>33-892</cross_reference>(c) quoted above, the defendants do not raise an issue properly determinable by a motion to dismiss, and the contention is rejected at this time.

Finally, the defendants contend that the Superior Court "has already decided it lacks jurisdiction to hear the claim" and the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents this court from entertaining this case. Def. Memorandum, No. 13, 2006, 8. This argument relies on a decision, also by Judge Downey, in another case between these warring parties<italic>R.S. Silver  Co. v. Pascarella</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, CV 03 0198172. In that case, which appears to be the lineal predecessor to this case, the court dismissed the complaint because at the time the complaint was filed, 2003, R.S. Silver Co., had been administratively dissolved and not reinstated. That is not the case at present, and therefore Judge Downey's decision does not act to collaterally estop Silver Enterprises from proceeding in this case, a circumstance which Judge Downey clearly foresaw as happening.<italic>Id.</italic>, Transcript September 11, 2006.
