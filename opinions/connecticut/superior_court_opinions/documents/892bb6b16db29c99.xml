<opinion_byline><unpublished>  ANGELA C. ROBINSON, Judge.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The Applicant, Settlement Funding, LLC d/b/a Peachtree Settlement Funding, hereby moves the Court pursuant to Conn. Practice Book ยง 17-4 to open the judgment in this matter so that the Applicant may withdraw the Application and the case in its entirety. In support hereof, the Applicant represents as follows:

1. By <italic>Application for Approval of Transfer of Structured Settlement</italic><italic>Payment Rights</italic> dated June 13, 2007 (the "Application"), the Applicant sought this Court's approval for the transfer of certain structured settlement payment rights pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>52-225g</cross_reference>, et seq. and Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>52-29</cross_reference>.

2. On or about July 19, 2007, the annuity owner, The St. Paul Travelers Companies ("Travelers") filed an objection to the Application.

3. A hearing was held on the Application on October 26, 2007.

4. On December 20, 2007, the Court (Robinson, J.) issued its Memorandum of Decision (the "Decision"), granting the Application, and entering judgment in favor of the Applicant.

5. On or about January 8, 2008, the Travelers appealed the Court's Decision to Connecticut Court of Appeals. The Travelers thereafter filed an amended appeal on January 25, 2008.

6. By this motion, the Applicant seeks an order of the court opening the Judgment, so that it can withdraw the Application and the case in its entirety. The law in Connecticut on the transfer of workers' compensation payments is not settled, and although Applicant is confident that the Decision would be affirmed on appeal, such result is far from certain and Applicant would be forced to incur substantial fees and costs with having to defend the appeal filed by the Travelers. CT Page 20652 Moreover, as a consequence of the stay pending appeal, the Applicant has been prevented from consummating the structured settlement transfer that is subject of the Application. The court approved the transfer, finding that it was in the best interests of David Mason, but unfortunately, the delay resulting from the appeal deprives Mr. Mason of the access to his money that he has an immediate need for, leaving the Applicant no other choice but to withdraw the Application.

WHEREFORE, on the basis of the foregoing, the Applicant seeks to open the Judgment in order to file a withdrawal of the Application in this matter.
