The defendant, Dollar Express, LLC seeks a summary judgment in this case, claiming that it is not the party liable for the plaintiff's injuries. Instead, it claims that the plaintiff's injuries occurred after a fall on premises owned and controlled by two individuals by the names of Manoj Patel and Meeta Patel (the Patels). The Patels are defendants in another action brought by the plaintiff, arising from the same facts, entitled <italic>Stefurak v. Patel</italic>, Docket No. NNI CV 05 5000094.

The court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact in dispute between the parties and, accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

"[S]ummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Smith v.</italic><italic>Greenwich</italic>, <cross_reference>278 Conn. 428</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>464</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>899 A.2d 563</cross_reference> (2006). "[I]n seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>Socha v. Bordeou</italic>, <cross_reference>277 Conn. 579</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>585</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>892 A.2d 422</cross_reference> (2006). "A material fact has been defined . . . as a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Buell</italic><italic>Industries, Inc. v. Greater New York Mutual Ins. Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>259 Conn. 527</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>556</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>791 A.2d 489</cross_reference> (2002). "In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court's function is not to decide issues of material fact, but CT Page 23245

rather to determine whether any such issues exist." <italic>Nolan v.</italic><italic>Borkowski</italic>, <cross_reference>206 Conn. 495</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>500</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>538</cross_reference> A.2d. 1031 (1988).

"As the party moving for summary judgment, the [movant] is required to support its motion with supporting documentation, including affidavits."<italic>Heyman Associates No. 1 v. Ins. Co. of Pennsylvania</italic>, <cross_reference>231 Conn. 756</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>796</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>653 A.2d 122</cross_reference> (1995). "Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto." Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>17-46</cross_reference>. "[Section <cross_reference>17-46</cross_reference>] sets forth three requirements necessary to permit the consideration of material contained in affidavits submitted in a summary judgment proceeding. The material must: (1) be based on 'personal knowledge'; (2) constitute facts that would be admissible at trial; and (3) affirmatively show that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit." <italic>Barrett v. Danbury Hospital</italic>, <cross_reference>232 Conn. 242</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>251</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>654 A.2d 748</cross_reference> (1995). "Documents in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment may be authenticated in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, a certified copy of a document or the addition of an affidavit by a person with personal knowledge that the offered evidence is a true and accurate representation of what its proponent claims it to be." <italic>New Haven v. Pantani</italic>, <cross_reference>89 Conn.App. 675</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>679</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>874 A.2d 849</cross_reference> (2005).

The defendant submitted two affidavits in support of its motion. Exhibit A is an affidavit of Zafar Farooqui, and Exhibit C is the affidavit of Manoj Patel and Meeta Patel. Although both affidavits are certified and meet the requirements to be considered in a motion for summary judgment, the affidavits do not support the conclusion that there is no issue of material fact regarding who controlled the store. Exhibit C, the affidavit of Manoj Patel and Meeta Patel, states: "We hereby acknowledge having purchase [sic] a One Hundred (100) percent interest in Dollar Express LLC." The affidavit goes on to state that Manoj Patel and Meeta Patel "are responsible for any potential or real liabilities that may have been incurred by Dollar Express LLC." Therefore, contrary to the defendant's assertion, this affidavit indicates that Manoj Patel and Meeta Patel bought Dollar Express LLC, not just the retail store, and thus Dollar Express LLC may have been the legal entity that was in control of the store at the time of the incident in question. The defendant has not produced any evidence that shows that Dollar Express LLC and the store were not the same legal entity. CT Page 23246 The affidavit of Zafar Farooqui, Exhibit A, contains only a conclusory

statement that Dollar Express LLC was not in control of the store at the time of the incident. A party's conclusory statements, "in the affidavit and elsewhere . . . do not constitute evidence sufficient to establish the existence of disputed material facts." <italic>Gupta v. New Britain General</italic><italic>Hospital</italic>, <cross_reference>239 Conn. 574</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>583</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>687 A.2d 111</cross_reference> (1996) ("The [party's] conclusory statements, in the affidavit and elsewhere, that he and the hospital had entered into an 'employment contract' do not constitute evidence sufficient to establish the existence of disputed material facts").<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

<center>                            <italic>B. Consolidation</italic></center>
At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the existence of a separate action against the Patels for the same injury was discussed, giving rise to the question of whether the court should consolidate, sua sponte, the cases of <italic>Stefurak v. Dollar Express LLC</italic>, Docket No. NNI CV 05 5000102 and <italic>Stefurak v. Patel</italic>, Docket No. NNI CV 05 5000094?

Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>9-5</cross_reference> entitled "Consolidation of Actions" provides: "(a) Whenever there are two or more separate actions which should be tried together, the judicial authority may, upon the motion of any party or upon its own motion, order that the actions be consolidated for trial." The decision to consolidate cases is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <italic>Alpha Crane Service Inc. v. Capitol Crane Co.</italic>,<cross_reference>6 Conn.App. 60</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>68</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>504 A.2d 1376</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>199 Conn. 808</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>508 A.2d 769</cross_reference> (1986). "Whether the actions arise out of the same transaction or involve identical parties are important factors in determining the propriety of the joinder or the consolidation of actions." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Mola v. Home Depot USA, Inc.</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, Docket No. CV 98 0167635 (April 7, 2000, Karazin, J.) (<cross_reference>27 Conn. L. Rptr. 60</cross_reference>, 61).

After verifying that <italic>Stefurak v. Patel</italic> arises out of the same set of facts, the court consolidates the cases. The issue of who was actually in control of the store is an important issue in both cases, and this question can best be answered if the cases are consolidated.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

<center>                             <italic>III. CONCLUSION</italic></center>
The defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. This case is consolidated with the case of <italic>Stefurak v. Patel</italic>, Docket No. NNI CV 05 5000094, sua sponte. CT Page 23247<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The court is aware that "[t]he existence of [a] genuine issue of material fact must be demonstrated by counter-affidavits and concrete

evidence . . . If the affidavits and the other supporting documents are inadequate, then the court is justified in granting the summary judgment, assuming that the movant has met his burden of proof." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>DeCorso v. Watchtower Bible  Tract</italic><italic>Society of New York, Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>78 Conn.App. 865</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>871</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829 A.2d 38</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>266 Conn. 931</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>837 A.2d 805</cross_reference> (2003). In this case, however, the defendant has not met his burden and therefore the burden does not shift to the plaintiff.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The defendant filed a motion to consolidate, dated May 8, 2006, which has not been claimed or heard by the court. It is motion number 110.</footnote_body>
