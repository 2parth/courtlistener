<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiffs, Town of East Haven (the town) and Michael Criscuolo (Criscuolo), attendees in permit proceedings before the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), brought by the Tweed-New Haven Airport Authority (Tweed), have appealed<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> to the Superior Court from an April 17, 2007 DEP decision issuing the permits to Tweed.

On November 6, 2000, Tweed applied to the DEP for permits and certifications to improve safety features at its major runway. (Return of Record, (ROR), Item App. 5.) The final version of the application was submitted in August 2006 and the matter was set for a public hearing. On June 25, 2001, the DEP commissioner granted the plaintiff Criscuolo intervenor status pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference>(a). (ROR, Item D.2.) Criscuolo is the chairman of the East Shore Conservation Commission, Inc.

During the course of the public hearing, the hearing officer considered a proposed alternative to the permits sought by Tweed, the "Engineering Materials Arresting System" or EMAS. While the Tweed permits involved extending the runway through filing wetlands, EMAS consists of interstitial concrete blocks joined together in a bed by epoxy and installed on top of a constructed paved surface capable of supporting aircraft and rescue/fire fighting vehicles. (Tweed Brief at page 18). EMAS is placed at the end of the runway, while the Tweed approach creates a "runway safety area" that is more lengthy and extensive.

The evidence before the hearing officer indicated that EMAS was inappropriate as an alternative. (ROR, Proposed Final Decision, Item A, p. 5.) It was not as safe as the Tweed approach, had environmental impacts of its own, and was more costly than that proposed by Tweed.

Also, during the course of the hearing, the town did not seek intervenor status. Regardless of the town's status, on December 13, CT Page 15897 2007, the town engineer was allowed by the hearing officer to give his opinion of the permit applications. The hearing officer admitted the engineer's testimony into evidence, but as to a report obtained by the town by Sterns  Wheler, LLC, the hearing officer stated that she would take the report merely for "general consideration." (ROR, Transcript, December 13, 2006, p. 129.)

A proposed final decision was issued on March 30, 2007. In that proposed decision, the hearing officer gave the following summary:

<block_quote>  1. The Tweed-New Haven Airport Authority (the applicant) has applied to the Department of Environmental Protection for various permits to conduct work at Tweed-New Haven Airport. In order to comply with Federal Aviation Administration requirements, the applicant proposes to create runway safety areas (RSAs) at each end of Runway 2/20 and to extend and rehabilitate Taxiway B. As a result of these activities and to compensate for unavoidable environmental impacts, the applicant would implement a plan to restore and enhance tidal wetlands.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. The DEP issued a tentative determination to approve these permit applications and staff has prepared draft permits that would authorize the proposed activities . . . A hearing was held in New Haven on December 6, 2006 for the receipt of public comment; the hearing was continued at the DEP in Hartford on December 12, 13 and 18. The parties to this proceeding are the applicant, DEP staff, and an intervening party, East Shore Conservation Association, Inc. (formerly East Haven/New Haven Committee for the Protection of Property Rights, Inc.), represented by its Chairman Michael Criscuolo.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. On February 22, 2007, the applicant and DEP staff jointly filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to the DEP Rules of Practice. Regs., Conn. State Agencies § <cross_reference>22a-3a-6</cross_reference>(x) . . . I have reviewed this submission and the administrative record, including documentary evidence and testimony presented during the hearing by the parties; I have also considered public comments and information presented before, at, or after the hearing.</block_quote>
CT Page 15898

<block_quote>  4. Following this review of the record and consideration of the facts and relevant law in this matter, I find that the applications comply with the applicable statutes and relevant provisions of the implementing regulations.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  5. If the regulated activities are conducted as proposed, adverse environmental impacts will be minimized to the greatest extent practicable while still allowing the applicant to meet the mandated goal of enhancing safety at the airport. The planned wetland mitigation and restoration program will compensate for unavoidable wetland impacts associated with this project.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  6. I therefore recommend issuance of all the draft permits, subject to the prerequisites and conditions set out below. (ROR, Item A, pp. 1-2.)</block_quote>

Regarding the town, the hearing officer mentioned only the following point:

<block_quote>  1. The Town of East Haven comments during the hearing that the applicant must obtain certain approvals from its inland wetlands commission for this project. This question is outside the scope of my jurisdiction in this case. However, permits issued by the DEP provide that nothing in the permit shall relieve the permittee of other obligations, including approvals required under applicable federal, state and local law. This provision is included in the draft permits for this project. (ROR, Item A, p. 6.)</block_quote>

After setting forth the evidence from the hearing, the hearing officer made the following conclusions:

<block_quote>  1. Adverse environmental impacts have been minimized to the greatest extent practicable while still allowing the applicant to accomplish the objective of enhancing safety at the airport. To compensate for unavoidable impacts, the applicant has proposed an extensive wetland restoration program, to be monitored by the DEP, which would restore approximately fifty-six acres of degraded tidal wetlands, enhancing CT Page 15899 their ecological and habitat value and re-creating the natural salt marsh environment.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. The intervening party [Criscuolo] did not demonstrate that the project would have, or is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state. General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference>(a).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. Although I am therefore not obliged to consider whether there are alternatives to the proposed activities, it is clear that the applicant did identify and assess numerous alternatives to the proposed activities and an alternative proposed by the DEP, the use of an Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS). There is more than sufficient evidence in the record that none of these alternatives, including EMAS, were found to be feasible or prudent. (ROR, Item A, p. 8.)</block_quote>

On April 17, 2007, the commissioner adopted the proposed final decision as the final decision. (ROR, Item A.) On May 1, 2007, the DEP issued final permits to Tweed. Criscuolo took an administrative appeal on June 12, 2007. On June 19, 2007, the town filed a notice of intervention in this appeal under § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference>(a), and the court granted this intervention as of right on January 31, 2008.

The sole issue raised by the town in the appeal is that the hearing officer made a procedural error under the Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>4-177</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>4-178</cross_reference> in accepting the Sterns  Wheler report "for general consideration" and not as full evidence.

As an intervenor who did not appeal from the final decision and only intervened under § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference>(a) in the appeal brought by Criscuolo, the town does not have standing to make this argument. An environmental intervenor is limited to those "environmental concerns that are within the jurisdiction of the particular administrative agency conducting the proceedings into which the party seeks to intervene." <italic>Nizzardo v. State</italic><italic>Traffic Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>259 Conn. 131</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>148</cross_reference> (2002). As the Supreme Court stated recently: "Although this court never expressly has concluded that standing under § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference> does not include standing to raise any related procedural issues, it is axiomatic that the statute encompasses substantive environmental issues only, and the court repeatedly has declined to consider whether procedural issues are covered." <italic>Pond View,</italic><italic>CT Page 15900</italic><italic>LLC v. Planning  Zoning Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>288 Conn. 143</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>151</cross_reference> (2008). On this basis, the town's appeal is found without merit on the ground of aggrievement.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

Criscuolo argues that the DEP erred in not more fully considering the EMAS alternative. This claim is reviewed under the "substantial evidence rule" as follows:

<block_quote>  Substantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. This substantial evidence standard is highly deferential and permits less judicial scrutiny than a clearly erroneous or weight of the evidence standard of review. The burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the agency's factual conclusions were not supported by the weight of substantial evidence on the whole record . . . Even as to questions of law, the court's ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.</block_quote>

A.2d (2001).

Criscuolo's appeal fails for two reasons. First he is incorrect that the DEP needed to consider the EMAS alternative. He cannot point to any evidence in the record that the permits would lead to unreasonable pollution or impairment of natural resources. See <italic>Paige v. Town Plan</italic><italic> Zoning Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>235 Conn. 448</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>462-63</cross_reference> A.2d (1995):

<block_quote>  By its plain terms, General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference>(b) requires the consideration of alternative plans <italic>only</italic>
where the commission first determines that it is  <italic>reasonably likely</italic> that the project would cause  <italic>unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction</italic> of the <italic>public trust in the natural resource at issue.</italic></block_quote>

(Emphasis in original.) CT Page 15901

The hearing officer found, contrary to Criscuolo's position, that the permits would not have the requisite impairment. (ROR, Item A, conclusion, point 2.) It is not enough to argue as does Criscuolo, that the size of the project alone satisfies this requirement. <italic>Waterbury v.</italic><italic>Washington</italic>, <cross_reference>260 Conn. 506</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>557</cross_reference> A.2d (2002) ("unreasonable" does not merely mean "something more than de minimis.")

Secondly, there is no question that the hearing officer considered the EMAS alternative. In her decision, she referenced the testimony of John Silva of the Federal Aviation Administration (ROR, December 12, 2006, transcript, pp. 52-57). He noted the safety, environmental and economic concerns that he had with the EMAS alternative. Expert Richard Domas regarded the EMAS structure a potential hazard to aircraft. (ROR, transcript, December 13, 2006, p. 38.) This is evidence that satisfies the substantial evidence rule.

The plaintiffs have not raised any other issues in this appeal and have not shown that the DEP decision to issue the permit was affected by an error of law or erroneous in light of the evidence on the record. § <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference>(j). Therefore the appeal is dismissed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The plaintiff Criscuolo applied for and received intervenor status in the DEP proceeding; the plaintiff town did not obtain intervenor status at the administrative hearing, but this court permitted its intervention under General Statutes § <cross_reference>22a-19</cross_reference> in Criscuolo's pending appeal.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The record shows that Criscuolo introduced no evidence and did not file proposed findings of fact/conclusions of law.</footnote_body>

She was not obliged to make use of it in her decision on the permits. The only requirement was that the hearing be fundamentally fair. <italic>Bancroft v.
