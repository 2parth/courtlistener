The plaintiff brings this action on behalf of his minor daughter, Carlyn Lenihan, against three defendants, the City of Bridgeport, Virginia Silano and Gerald Host.

On March 19, 2005, the City of Bridgeport offered dogs for sale at the North Shore Animal Adoption show, held in Fairfield. The plaintiff, Paul Lenihan, accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, attended the show.

In his complaint, the plaintiff alleges that his daughter was invited to pet a certain dog, a pit bull, at the suggestion of the defendant Gerald Host. When the child attempted to pet the dog, she was bitten on the face, right eye and head, causing lacerations of the eye socket, eyelid, eyelash and left cheek. The minor plaintiff required medical care and treatment, and claims to have suffered permanent scarring.

In the August 31, 2006 substituted complaint, four counts are pled. Count one is addressed to the City of Bridgeport, count two pertains to Virginia Silano, and counts three and four are directed to Gerald Host.

In count one, the plaintiff claims that the City of Bridgeport, acting through the Bridgeport Animal Shelter, had the care, custody and control of the pit bull which injured Carlyn Lenihan on March 19, 2005.

It is alleged that an "agent or employee" of the City of Bridgeport invited the child to pet the pit bull, prior to the attack. The plaintiff claims (paragraph 10), that the City of Bridgeport, acting through its agent of employee, was negligent in one or more of six ways, resulting in injury to the child.

Paragraph 13 of the first count claims "This action is prosecuted pursuant to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference> of the Connecticut General Statutes," That statute CT Page 4386 reads:

<block_quote>  . . . if any dog does any damage to either the body or property of an person, the owner or keeper . . . shall be liable for such damage, except when such damage has been occasioned to the body of a person who, at the time such damage was sustained, was committing a trespass or other tort, or was teasing, tormenting or abusing such dog.</block_quote>

The statute imposes strict liability on the owner or keeper of a dog that does any damage to the body or property of any person. <italic>Falby v.</italic><italic>Zarembski</italic>, <cross_reference>221 Conn. 14</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>19</cross_reference> (1992); <italic>Maccarone v. Hawley</italic>, <cross_reference>7 Conn.App. 19</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>24</cross_reference> (1986).

In counts one, two and three, which are addressed to the City of Bridgeport, Virginia Silano and Gerald Host respectively, allegations of negligent conduct are specified. However, all three counts also contain a reference to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference> of the General Statutes.

Count four makes no reference to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference>, C.G.S. This count alleges that Gerald Host acted with gross negligence and "recklessly" in permitting the seven-year-old to pet the pit bull.

The City of Bridgeport filed an answer and four special defenses on February 12, 2007. It also filed a cross claim against the defendant Gerald Host, alleging a common-law right of indemnification.

Three of the special defenses raise issues of governmental immunity and statutory immunity. The fourth seems to allege that any negligence of the City of Bridgeport was not a substantial factor in causing injury to Carlyn Lenihan, although no claim of comparative negligence has been asserted.

The defendant, Gerald Host, moves to strike the cross claim, arguing that it is insufficient as a matter of law.

<center>                  <italic>STANDARD OF REVIEW — MOTION TO STRIKE</italic></center>
The purpose of a motion to strike is to contest the legal sufficiency of the allegations contained in a complaint, to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <italic>Faulkner v. United Technologies Corp</italic>.,<cross_reference>240 Conn. 576</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>580</cross_reference> (1997); Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-39</cross_reference>.

CT Page 4387 A motion to strike assumes all well-pleaded facts. If facts, as deemed provable in a complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. <italic>Vacco v. Microsoft Corp.</italic>, <cross_reference>260 Conn. 59</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>64-65</cross_reference>
(2002). All facts must be construed in the manner most favorable to the non-moving party, in this case, the City of Bridgeport. <italic>Novametric</italic><italic>Medical Systems, Inc. v. BOC Group, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>224 Conn. 210</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>215</cross_reference> (1992);<italic>Gordon v. Bridgeport Housing Authority</italic>, <cross_reference>208 Conn. 161</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>170</cross_reference> (1988).

<center>            <italic>NO INDEMNIFICATION CLAIM IS PERMITTED PURSUANT TO</italic><italic>§ <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference> OF THE GENERAL STATUTES</italic></center>
In order to sustain a claim for indemnification at common law, a party must plead and prove the four-fold test first announced in <italic>Kaplan v.</italic><italic>Merberg Wrecking Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>152 Conn. 405</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>416</cross_reference> (1965).

Common-law indemnification requires proof that 1) the party against whom indemnification is sought was negligent, 2) that party's negligence, rather than the defendant's own passive negligence, was the direct, immediate cause of the incident and the resulting damages, 3) the other party was in control of the situation to the exclusion of the party seeking indemnification, and 4) the party seeking indemnification did not know of the other party's negligence, had no reason to anticipate it, and could reasonably rely upon the other party not to be negligent.<italic>Kaplan v. Merberg Wrecking Corp., supra</italic>, 416; <italic>Smith v. New Haven</italic>,<cross_reference>258 Conn. 56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>66</cross_reference> (2001).

Negligence by the owner or keeper of a dog is not required in order to establish a cause of action pursuant to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference>, C.G.S. The statute extends liability beyond that existing at common law, because it abrogates the doctrine of scienter, which required knowledge by the owner of a dog's ferocious or mischievous propensity. <italic>Stokes v.</italic><italic>Lyddy</italic>, <cross_reference>75 Conn.App. 252</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>266</cross_reference> (2003); <italic>Murphy v. Buonoto</italic>,<cross_reference>42 Conn.App. 239</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>248</cross_reference> (1996).

Therefore, no claim for indemnification arising out of liability imposed pursuant to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference>, C.G.S. can be maintained by the City of Bridgeport.

However, counts one, two and three can be read to allege a cause of action based upon common-law negligence, in addition to seeking recovery pursuant to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference>, C.G.S. A review of the pleadings does not reveal the filing of a request to revise designed to separate the common-law causes of action from those permitted under the statute.

CT Page 4388 Therefore, any claim of indemnification as to the common-law cause of action must be addressed.

In <italic>Blake v. Reeves,</italic> (CV05 4005750 S., J.D. of Stamford/Norwalk), 2007 Conn.Super Lexis (Nadeau, J.) [<cross_reference>42 Conn. L. Rptr. 602</cross_reference>], cited by the City of Bridgeport, the plaintiff brought a two-count complaint.

Count one sought recovery pursuant to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference>, C.G.S., while count two sought recovery under a common-law negligence theory.

A cross claim was filed by the dog's owner against a babysitter, who had been brought into the case as an apportionment defendant. The cross claim involved only the common-law negligence count.

The court in <italic>Blake</italic> permitted to cross claim as to the common-law negligence court, for which indemnification was appropriate. The count pled under the statute was not the subject of the claim for indemnification.

Because the operative pleading in this case could support both a § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference> C.G.S. claim, as well as a common-law negligence action against the City of Bridgeport, the motion to strike must be denied in part.

The question of whether a party was primarily negligent, and therefore is precluded from seeking indemnification from another party, is a question of fact. <italic>Weintraub v. Richard Dahn, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>188 Conn. 570</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>573-74</cross_reference>
(1982). The question of whether a party against whom indemnification is sought was in exclusive control of the situation, and whether the negligence was active or passive, also represent questions of fact, which cannot be determined on a motion to strike. <italic>Preferred Accident</italic><italic>Ins. Co. v. Musante, Berman  Steinberg Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>133 Conn. 536</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>543</cross_reference> (1947).

The motion to strike is GRANTED, to the extent that indemnification is sought in the event of a judgment against the City of Bridgeport pursuant to § <cross_reference>22-357</cross_reference> of the General Statutes.

The motion to strike is DENIED, to the extent that it seeks indemnification in the event of a judgment against the City of Bridgeport based upon common-law negligence.

The court has not considered the issue of whether indemnification would be appropriate, in a situation where liability is purely vicarious, or is the result of an agency relationship, in that some of the allegations of negligence in count one may relate to persons other than the defendant, Gerald Host.
