SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM OF DECISION

</unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>    KARAZIN, JUDGE. CT Page 5956

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>    This is supplemental to the Memorandum of Decision of April 14, 1993 following trial of the subject action.

Said decision is hereby supplemented as follows:

1. The maiden name of the defendant is restored to Gilda Suppa.

2. Prior Memorandum Order Number 6 is corrected to reflect that the first referenced Gateway account contains $3,500.00, not $35,000.00.

In all other respects the prior Judgment of this Court remains the same.

Karazin, Judge
