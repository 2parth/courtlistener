<opinion_byline><unpublished>  HOWARD T. OWENS, JUDGE TRIAL REFEREE.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff and the defendant, whose birth name was DelZio intermarried at Fairfield, Connecticut on June 23, 1984. The parties have been married approximately 20 years. There are five children of the marriage, four of whom are minors. Their names are Courtney, Jessica, Lauren and Alicia. The Court has the requisite jurisdiction. The marriage has broken down irretrievably and is hereby dissolved.

Both of the parties, who are 51 years old, are physicians. The wife has never practiced medicine primarily because she has had the awesome responsibility of bringing up their five children. The husband, who is a practicing oncologist, is in a three-member medical group partnership. Both of the parties have adequate parenting skills.

In 1995 the husband experienced legal difficulties that seriously affected his medical practice. These details need not be set forth. In any event, the family economy suffered considerably until the husband overcame his problems and reestablished himself as a highly successful physician and provider. The husband left the marital home in October of 2003. He claims his wife's housekeeping skills left much to be desired and she spent most of her time with the children and little time with him. Husband claims little sexual contact with the wife since 2001. The wife inherited approximately $150,000 from her mother and this was used for the benefit of the entire family when the husband was in the throes of expensive legal difficulties. The Court is not unmindful of this contribution when it was most needed.

There is some question as to whether or not Dr. Berard's relationship with Amy Dineen started after the marriage had broken down or was the primary cause of the breakdown. The wife CT Page 15742 has a history of depression and is being treated for same with medication. The depression has contributed to the condition of the home. She has no outside interests other than the children's activities and she's prone to excessive sleeping. She is working on her underlying medical problem that has probably been the basis for some of husband's complaints. She completed medical school and some residency but did not pursue her career. As an alternate she became the wife and mother of five. She also has taught sciences in secondary school in Connecticut and contemplates renewing her long expired teacher certification. With the limited availability of assets and four children in high school and grammar school the cause of the breakdown is probably not significant. In any event the cause for breakdown of the marriage lies primarily with the father.

1. The marriage shall be dissolved on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown.

2. The husband and wife shall share joint legal custody of the minor children and the wife shall have primary physical custody of the minor children. The husband will have a reasonable, liberal and flexible parenting plan with the children, including but not limited to alternating weekends, and mid-week visitation, and a sharing of holidays and vacations. A specific schedule regarding parenting times shall be discussed between the parties, and if they are unable to agree, the parties shall mediate parenting times with the children's therapist. When negotiating parenting times, the wishes of the minor children will be taken into consideration. The parties will cooperate with the children's therapist and will mediate, with his or her assistance, issues regarding the children, including but not limited to parenting times. The parties shall make every reasonable good faith effort to work together and shall confer and consult on all major issues concerning the children's health, education and welfare. The parties shall refrain from making any demeaning or disparaging remarks about the other parent or the parent's family, and the parents will endeavor to foster a feeling of affection and respect for the children with the other parent.

3. The husband shall pay to the wife the sum of $2,500.00 per week as unallocated alimony and child support until the wife's remarriage, or cohabitation, the death of either party or CT Page 15743 December 26, 2022.

By motion from either party on or about December 26, 2017, or sooner in the event of a significant change in circumstances, the parties may review the amount and duration of alimony based on circumstances in the place at the time. However, in no event shall alimony continue beyond December 26, 2022.

The aforementioned unallocated alimony/child support is a deviation from the State of Connecticut Child Support Guidelines, however, said deviation is fair and equitable, and an imposition of the guidelines would be unfair and inequitable, based on tax considerations, total family support, and other equitable factors.

The wife shall be entitled to earn up to $40,000.00 gross income annually before her earnings would be considered a substantial change in circumstances upon which to base a motion to modify the aforementioned unallocated alimony and support order.

Based on the plaintiff's pendente lite motion for modification, dated May 6, 2005, and based upon orders of the Court entered by Stipulation on November 3, 2004, wherein the terms of the stipulation and order of the court were in effect until January 1, 2005, at which time the parties were to renegotiate or re-litigate if necessary the issue of pendente lite support, alimony and payment of household expenses, the plaintiff's obligations pursuant to said orders are reduced by $500.00 per month, retroactive to January 1, 2005, allowing the plaintiff a total current credit for payments to the wife in the amount of $5,000.00. Said credit shall be applied by reducing the unallocated alimony and support payments due and payable to the wife as set forth, in the amount of $250.00 per month commencing January 1, 2006 until fully reduced.

There will be no alimony payments from the wife to the husband and both parties acknowledge that this provision is non-modifiable under any circumstances.

4. The parties shall, based on their financial ability, share equally in the cost of higher education for the minor children with the limitations as set forth in Connecticut General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>46b-56c</cross_reference>. The aforementioned obligation of the parties may be fulfilled by obtaining loans with the limitations as set forth CT Page 15744 above in Connecticut General Statutes, and the parties will make every reasonable good faith effort to cooperate with reference to applications for financial aid, applications for loans or scholarships, and the like. The obligation of the parties shall be further reduced by any scholarships or awards obtained by any of the minor children. The court shall retain jurisdiction to enter any other educational support order.

The parties shall also share equally in the private school tuition for the minor children, and if, and only if, the parents agree on the choice of school and whether or not any child shall attend private school. In the event that one parent sends a child or the children to private school, over the objection of the other parent, then that parent shall be solely responsible for the cost of tuition. The resources of the parties should best be reserved for college education particularly since both parties agree that the present public schools in the community where the children reside provides quality education.

The husband shall give to the wife the sum of $25,000 within 60 days from date of judgment and this sum should be used to reduce tuition expenses due and owing for the 2005 and 2006 school years and any prior balance due.

5. The plaintiff has received a cash bonus from his medical practice, on an annual basis, in December of each year. The plaintiff also receives an additional payment of contribution to a 401k or pension plan, which may also be taken as a cash bonus, after the payment of interest and penalties. The husband shall be entitled to keep and maintain the monies he will receive from the aforementioned bonuses, and pension contributions, without any claim or demand by the wife, until the accrued after tax and after penalty bonuses and pension distributions total the sum of $156,000.00 is paid to the plaintiff. The husband shall provide to the wife copies of all documentation and tax calculations regarding said bonuses, and pension distributions, upon receipt. After the limitation as set forth above, the husband will pay to the wife (33%) of the gross amount of any bonus and pension distribution as set forth above, as additional alimony, up through December 12, 2022. The wife will have no further claim or demand upon any bonus or pension distribution subsequent to December 12, 2022. The aforementioned provision with reference to the bonus and pension distribution is subject to modification upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances, but only after said bonuses and distributions totaling $156,000.00 have CT Page 15745 been received by the husband.

6. The husband shall quit claim to the wife all of his right, title and interest in the property known as 61 Maler Avenue in Shelton, Connecticut, and said property will remain hers, without any claim or demand from the husband. The wife will indemnify the husband and hold him harmless from any claims arising out of payment for ownership of said property. The wife will be solely responsible for, and will indemnify and hold the husband harmless for payments, which include but are limited to, real property taxes, utilities, any and all encumbrances, and all costs of repair or maintenance.

7. The husband shall be responsible for the tax liability for 2003 and 2004. The parties will file separately for the tax year 2005, and the husband will claim all the deductions for mortgage interest and taxes through December 31, 2005. The husband will also claim all of the children that are eligible, as exemptions and deductions on his 2005 tax returns. In tax year 2006, and for each year thereafter, the parties will equally share the exemptions and deductions for the children, for federal and state income tax purposes.

8. Each party will pay their own liabilities, as set forth on their respective financial affidavits, and each party will hold the other harmless and indemnify the other party from any claims or demand thereon.

9. Except as set forth herein, each party will keep those assets as appear on their respective financial affidavits, without any claim or demand by the other.

10. Each party shall keep those items of personal property, including any motor vehicles, currently in the name of either party, or in the possession of either party, without any claim or demand by the other and shall execute whatever documents are necessary.

11. Husband shall contribute $5,000 towards wife's costs and attorneys fees.

12. The husband will maintain the existing $1,000,000 term life insurance policy naming the children as equal beneficiaries on one-half of the death benefit available, and naming the wife as beneficiary on the remaining one-half death benefit available. CT Page 15746 The obligation to name the children as beneficiaries as set forth above will remain in place until the youngest child attains the age of 23. The obligation to name the wife as beneficiary on said insurance policy will remain in effect for so long as any alimony obligation exists.

13. The husband will continue to maintain the existing medical insurance for the benefit of the minor children. The parties will share equally in any uninsured and unreimbursed medical and dental expense for the minor children. However, neither party will incur any uninsured medical or dental expense, including orthodontia, for which the other party may be responsible if said expense is in excess of $250.00 except in the event of an emergency, without the prior written approval of the other party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.

14. The wife may avail herself of COBRA benefits that are available to her from the husband's employment, and the husband will co-operate with reference to same. If the wife does so avail herself of COBRA benefits, she will do so at her own expense.

15. Whatever interest the husband may have in Black Rock Turnpike Medical Group, P.C. shall remain his without any claim or demand by the wife.

16. Each party shall retain their respective bank accounts. CT Page 15747
