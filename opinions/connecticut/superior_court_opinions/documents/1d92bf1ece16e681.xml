</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This case arises from a motor vehicle accident on June 13, 1995. The plaintiff, who was an employee of the State of Connecticut, was operating a motor vehicle owned by the State. She alleges that, while stopped in response to traffic conditions, her vehicle was struck from behind and pushed into the car in front of it by a vehicle owned by Josette Serke and operated by Joseph Serke (hereinafter, "tortfeasor"). The plaintiff alleges that she suffered injuries in the accident. She also alleges that the full amount of the tortfeasor's liability insurance policy has been exhausted and paid out to her. The plaintiff made a claim under the underinsured motorist provision of her insurance policy. The defendant refused to pay, and this action ensued. Before the court is the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that there is no genuine issue of material fact because the plaintiff does not have a viable underinsured motorist claim. Specifically, the defendant claims that the plaintiff's suit was not filed with the applicable statute of limitations, accidents sustained while operating government vehicles are not covered by her policy, and the limits of the state's policy exceed the limits of the plaintiff's policy.

The following additional facts are material to the issue. The tortfeasor's insurer paid the policy limits ($20,000.00) on January 15, 1998. The state's UM protection does not exceed the $20,000.00 paid by the tortfeasor. The plaintiff has a $300,000.00 insurance policy with the defendant. The plaintiff's policy contains the following language relative to the coverage: "Underinsured motor vehicle means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type for which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or policies applicable at the CT Page 5879 time of accident is less than the fair, just and reasonable damages of the insured. " The policy is silent on the issue of a statute of limitations. The complaint was served on the Secretary of State on January 14, 2004.

"[S]ummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Lees v. Middlesex Ins. Co.,</italic><cross_reference>229 Conn. 842</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>849-50</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>643 A.2d 1282</cross_reference> (1994).

The defendant argues first that the plaintiff's suit claim was not instituted in a timely manner and must be dismissed. The defendant contends that the plaintiff had six years from the accident in which to commence suit. The defendant argues that a demand for arbitration was not made within 180 days of the exhaustion of the underlying liability coverage and therefore the statute of limitations was not tolled. The plaintiff counters that the six years runs from the date of the exhaustion of the underlying liability coverage. The court agrees with the plaintiff.

General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>52-576</cross_reference> provides, in pertinent part: "No action for an account, or on any simple or implied contract, or on any contract in writing, shall be brought but within six years after the right of action accrues . . . "Applied to a cause of action, the term to accrue means to arrive; to commence; to come into existence; to become a present enforceable demand."<italic>Prudential Property  Casualty Ins. Co. v. Perez-Henderson,</italic><cross_reference>49 Conn.App. 653</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>658</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>714 A.2d 1281</cross_reference> (1998), cert. denied,<cross_reference>247 Conn. 917</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>722 A.2d 807</cross_reference> (1998). "The true test (in determining when the cause or right of action is considered as having accrued) is to establish the time when the plaintiff first could have successfully maintained his action." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Engelman v. Connecticut General Life Ins. Co.,</italic><cross_reference>240 Conn. 287</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>294</cross_reference> n. 7, <cross_reference>690 A.2d 882</cross_reference> (1997). In this case the cause of action accrued on January 15, 1998.

In Connecticut, "[i]t is well settled that a civil action is brought on the date on which the writ of summons is served on the CT Page 5880 defendant." <italic>Feldmann v. Sebastian,</italic> <cross_reference>261 Conn. 721</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>729</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>805 A.2d 713</cross_reference> (2002). This suit was commenced on January 14, 2004, within the applicable period. The defendant's motion is denied on this ground.

The defendant next argues that the plaintiff is not entitled to bring an underinsured motorist action because she was operating a vehicle owned by the state, a governmental unit and a self-insurer. The defendant's endorsement PP 04 91 excludes any vehicle owned by a governmental unit from its definition of underinsured motor vehicle.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The facts indicate that it was the plaintiff, not the tortfeasor, who was operating the vehicle owned by the state. It is the tortfeasor's vehicle which is the underinsured vehicle, i.e., "a . . . vehicle . . . for which the sum of the limits of liability ($20,000.00 in this case) under . . . [the] polic[y] applicable at the time of accident is less than the fair, just and reasonable damages of the insured." Thus, the policy provision to which the defendant refers is inapplicable to the instant case. The motion must be denied on this ground.

Finally, the defendant argues that the State's liability policy exceeds the limits of the plaintiff's underinsured motorist coverage. The plaintiff correctly points out that the defendant has provided no documentation of the state's liability coverage. Beyond that fact, however, is the fact that the state's liability coverage, whatever it is, is inapplicable in this case. The only liability coverage which applies is that which covers the tortfeasor's vehicle. Moreover, the plaintiff attaches an arbitration decision wherein the panel found that the amount of underinsured motorist coverage available from the state does not exceed the amount paid by the tortfeasor. The motion is denied on this ground.

For the above-stated reasons, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.
