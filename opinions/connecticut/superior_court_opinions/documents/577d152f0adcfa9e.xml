<opinion_text><unpublished>  We start with the proposition that unmodifiable alimony provisions are enforceable under C.G.S. ยง <cross_reference>46b-86</cross_reference>. They are however not looked upon favorably by our courts. Nevertheless, a carefully worded nonmodifiable alimony clause will be enforced by our courts in accordance with the aforementioned C.G.S. ยง <cross_reference>46b-86</cross_reference>.

In the case at hand, the amount, if any, of alimony to be paid to the plaintiff, is set out in some detail in Article 2.1 of the Separation Agreement incorporated in the decree of dissolution.

Article 2.4 states that:

<block_quote>  <italic>the parties</italic> are expressly precluded from seeking a modification of the Husband's obligation under Article 2.1 as to the amount or the duration of alimony except as provided in Article 2.1. (Emphasis added.)</block_quote>

Article 2.4 unambiguously precludes alimony modification <italic>by</italic><italic>the parties</italic> except as outlined in Article 2.1. The definition of gross income to be applied to Article 2.1 is found in Article 2.2. Importantly, the agreement does not tell us whether the parties intended that <italic>the court</italic> was also precluded from modifying alimony. The court in <italic>Bronson v. Bronson,</italic><cross_reference>1 Conn.App. 337</cross_reference>, was faced with a similar situation with similar wording. That court found that nothing in the agreement prohibited modification <italic>by the court.</italic> Ambiguous orders of periodic alimony are treated as modifiable. <italic>Cummock v. Cummock,</italic> <cross_reference>180 Conn. 218</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>222-23</cross_reference>. The <italic>Bronson</italic> court continued that "the court has the power to modify the alimony payments and to grant relief in accordance with equitable principles." Pg. 339.

Where, as here, an agreement is incorporated by reference in CT Page 11858 the decree of dissolution, the decree should be construed by ascertaining the intent expressed in the language of the agreement. <italic>McDonnell v. McDonnell,</italic> <cross_reference>166 Conn. 146</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>150</cross_reference>.

The court having found grounds to deny the Motion to Strike, Post-Judgment, in the previous paragraphs need not answer the request of the plaintiff to modify the decree as to the definition of "gross yearly earned income" found in Article 2.2.

The Motion to Strike is denied.
