</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Plaintiff, Tam Jackson has filed the Complaint for Bill of Discovery, dated July 23, 2009, by which she seeks to obtain information about a screw which was left in her abdominal cavity during a hysterectomy at Yale New Haven Hospital on or about August 24, 2007. Specifically she wants to know, <italic>inter</italic><italic>alia</italic>, the name and model number of the product from which the screw separated; the name of the manufacturer; who purchased it; whether it was altered; and whether such an incident has occurred previously. The Complaint for Bill of Discovery posits that the information is necessary to a proper determination of negligence, and that there is no adequate remedy at law to obtain the requested information.

Defendants Yale New Haven Hospital and Masoud Azodi have filed a Motion to Strike plaintiff, Tam Jackson's Complaint for Bill of Discovery. In the motion the defendants cite the case of<italic>Berger v. Cuomo</italic>, <cross_reference>230 Conn. 1</cross_reference> (1994) for the proposition that plaintiff's Complaint for Bill of Discovery does not meet the recognized pre-requisites of the traditional bill inasmuch as this one does not allege facts sufficient to establish that what she "seeks to discover is material and necessary for proof of, or is needed to aid in proof or in defense of another action already brought or about to be brought," <italic>Berger</italic>, p. 6. Furthermore, this Bill does not "demonstrate by detailed facts that there is probable cause to bring a potential cause of action,"<italic>Berger</italic>, p. 7. Nor does this Bill "show that there is some describable sense of wrong," <italic>Berger</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>, in that there is no claim in the Bill that the screw caused her to suffer injury.

<center>                               Conclusion</center>
For the reasons that the prerequisites recognized in <italic>Berger v.</italic><italic>Cuomo</italic> are not present in plaintiff's Complaint for Bill of CT Page 17384 Discovery, dated July 23, 2009, the Motion to Strike is granted.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>
