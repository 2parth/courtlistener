<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff is the owner of property located at 20 Vista Avenue, Milford, Connecticut. On March 27, 2003, the plaintiff applied for a Zoning Permit for its premises at 20 Vista Avenue. The City of Milford approved the Application. On July 16, 2003, the decision was appealed to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals voted to overturn the Decision approving the zoning permit. The Board did not provide the plaintiff with notice prior to its September 9, 2003 hearing.

The plaintiff has established aggrievement.

The court finds that the plaintiff did not receive notice and remands the matter to the Board for purposes of providing plaintiff with Due Process; a fair hearing.
