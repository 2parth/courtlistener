<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                           <italic>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</italic></center>
The plaintiff, Robert Campbell, (hereinafter referred to as the "Plaintiff"), has brought this action against Charlotte Hungerford Hospital (hereinafter referred to as the "Hospital"), hospital employee Richard Hutchings (hereinafter referred to as "Hutchings") and ambulance driver Joseph Gadomski (hereinafter referred to as "Gadomski") for negligence and assault arising from a hospital visit.

On or about April 11, 2002, the plaintiff was admitted to the Hospital for treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning. Through his complaint, the plaintiff alleges the following facts.

While receiving treatment in the emergency room, the plaintiff was denied access to a telephone and subjected to verbal harassment and abuse. He was subjected to the use of four point restraints during which time he was physically struck by Hutchings and Gadomski multiple times about the face and head. The plaintiff alleges that the actions of these defendants caused his condition to worsen and is seeking money damages, punitive damages and costs.

This action was commenced on March 16, 2004. In the original complaint, the plaintiff pleaded four counts of negligence against the three defendants. Two of the defendants, the Hospital and Hutchings, subsequently filed a request to revise the complaint on April 7, 2004, seeking separation of the allegations against each defendant into separate counts and separation of the statutory violations and common-law causes of action. The plaintiff complied by filing a revised complaint on April 15, 2004. The defendants filed two additional requests to revise, to which the plaintiff complied with a second and third revision. CT Page 15825 The third revision, entitled "Second Revised Complaint," dated July 9, 2004, is now the operative pleading before the court.

In the second revised complaint, the plaintiff avers, in twenty counts, injuries caused by negligence and deliberate conduct on the part of the Hospital, Hutchings and Gadomski. On July 19, 2004, the Hospital and Hutchings filed a motion to strike counts one, two, five, six, seven, eight, ten, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and twenty of the plaintiff's complaint accompanied by a memorandum of law in support thereof. The plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition on August 20, 2004.

"The purpose of a motion to strike is to contest . . . the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaint . . . to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."

Because "[a] motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading . . . [it] requires no factual findings by the trial court." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Broadnax v. New Haven,</italic><cross_reference>270 Conn. 133</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>173</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>851 A.2d 1113</cross_reference> (2004). Furthermore, "[t]he modern trend, which is followed, in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically . . . Although essential allegations may not be supplied by conjecture or remote implication . . . the complaint must be read in its entirety in such a way as to give effect to the pleading with reference to the general theory upon which it proceeded, and do substantial justice between the parties."

(2003).

<center>                          <italic>Counts One  Ten</italic><footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference></center>
The defendants move to strike count one with respect to the Hospital and count ten with respect to Hutchings on the ground that the plaintiffs claim that the defendants breached a duty under General Statutes § <cross_reference>17a-546</cross_reference> by failing to permit the plaintiff to make a telephone call is legally insufficient.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> In support of their motion to strike, the defendants' argue that the plaintiff is barred from bringing a claim under the patients' bill of rights, General Statutes § CT Page 15826<cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference>, et seq. because the plaintiff fails to allege that he was a member of the class covered by the statute, namely, persons afflicted with mental illness or psychiatric disability. In addition, the defendants allege that § <cross_reference>17a-546</cross_reference> does not expressly provide for a private right of action. They further maintain that the plaintiff fails to allege that a statutory exception to §<cross_reference>17a-546</cross_reference> would not apply.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Finally, the defendants contend that the claims set forth in counts one and ten are legally insufficient because the plaintiff has failed to file a good faith certificate pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-190a</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

In his memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants' motion, the plaintiff counters that General Statutes § <cross_reference>17a-550</cross_reference>
explicitly provides for a private cause of action such as the subject claim inasmuch as it states that "[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation of sections <cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference> to <cross_reference>17a-549</cross_reference>, inclusive, may . . . bring a civil action for damages." He asserts that he is a "patient" covered by the patients' bill of rights as a "person being treated in a facility." General Statutes § <cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference>(b). He further argues that statutory exceptions to a cause of action need not be alleged in a complaint. Finally, the plaintiff counters that General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-190</cross_reference> is inapplicable in the present matter because he is alleging a violation of his statutory rights as a patient.

The patients' bill of rights, codified in General Statutes §§<cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference> through <cross_reference>17a-550</cross_reference>, "represents the breadth of the legislative concern for the fair treatment of <italic>mental</italic> patients." (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Wiseman v.</italic><italic>Armstrong,</italic> <cross_reference>269 Conn. 802</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>821-22</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>850 A.2d 114</cross_reference> (2004). "[T]he substantive provisions of the patients' bill of rights encompass state <italic>mental health facilities</italic> as well as private institutions." (Emphasis added.) <italic>Mahoney v. Lensink,</italic><cross_reference>213 Conn. 548</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>569 A.2d 518</cross_reference> (1990).

The plaintiff alleges in count one of the second revised complaint that the Hospital, by failing to permit the plaintiff to make a telephone call, was in violation of General Statutes §<cross_reference>17a-546</cross_reference>. Count ten alleges the same violation with regard to Hutchings. The factual allegations of both counts, however, fail to satisfy a statutory basis for bringing such a claim under the patients' bill of rights. General Statutes § <cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference>, limits the application of the patients' bill of rights to persons receiving treatment in "any inpatient or outpatient hospital, clinic, or other facility for the diagnosis, observation or treatment of CT Page 15827 persons with psychiatric disabilities." General Statutes §<cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference>(a). A "hospital, clinic, or other facility" as defined in this section "must be one for which the <italic>main purpose</italic> is diagnosis, observation or treatment" of persons with psychiatric disabilities. (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>Wiseman v. Armstrong, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>269 Conn. 810</cross_reference>. The plaintiff does not allege in counts one and ten that he was afflicted with, nor undergoing treatment for, any psychiatric disability. Furthermore, the plaintiff's application of the term "patient" to persons treated in <italic>any</italic> hospital or medical facility belies the legislative intent of the statute, which was "to remedy the then prevailing conditions at . . . <italic>mental</italic> health facilities." (Emphasis added.) <italic>Mahoney v. Lensink, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>213 Conn. 559</cross_reference>. Therefore, in the absence of factual allegations that he is a member of the protected class, the plaintiff cannot properly bring a cause of action under § <cross_reference>17a-546</cross_reference>. The defendants' motion to strike counts one and ten is granted on this ground. Accordingly, the court need not consider the defendants' alternate grounds for striking these counts.

<center>                          <italic>Counts Two  Thirteen</italic></center>
The defendants move to strike counts two and thirteen of the plaintiff's second revised complaint on the ground that the plaintiff fails to allege under which of the 28 subsections of General Statutes § <cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference> he was seeking relief. They argue that in count two with respect to the Hospital, the plaintiff fails to assert a factual basis on which any of the subsections of §<cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference> might apply. Likewise, they contend that count thirteen is devoid of specific factual allegations that would support a claim that Hutchings violated any subsection of § <cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference>. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's vague assertion in both counts that he was not treated "equally to other patients" provides insufficient facts to sustain a claim for relief under any subsection of § <cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference>.

The plaintiff counters that he has alleged sufficient facts in counts two and thirteen to state a legally cognizable action under § <cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference>(e), which provides a private cause of action for patients deprived of "a right or benefit created for the well being of patients."<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> The plaintiff argues that being denied the use of a telephone during his stay at the hospital deprived him of a right or benefit created for the well-being of patients. CT Page 15828

Counts two and thirteen fail to specify which, if any, of the 28 protections was violated by the defendants' conduct. However, even if the plaintiff did specify a specific subsection, counts two and thirteen must be striken nonetheless because the statute is inapplicable to the present case.

"General Statutes § <cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference> specifies 28 rights conferred on<italic>nursing home patients</italic> by the legislature."<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> <italic>Klimas v.</italic><italic>Connecticut Health Associates, Inc.,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV 99 0152955 (November 20, 2002, Holzberg, J.). The second revised complaint fails to provide any factual allegations to support a claim that Charlotte Hungerford Hospital is a "nursing home facility" or "chronic disease hospital" covered by § <cross_reference>19a-550</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> In the absence of facts in support of the plaintiff's claims in counts two and thirteen, the plaintiff has asserted mere conclusions of law. As the Supreme Court held in <italic>Novametrix Medical Systems, Inc. v.</italic><italic>BOC Group, Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>224 Conn. 210</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>215</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>618 A.2d 25</cross_reference> (1992), "[a] motion to strike is properly granted if the complaint alleges mere conclusions of law that are unsupported by the facts alleged." <italic>Id.</italic> The defendants' motion to strike counts two and thirteen is granted.

<center>                         <italic>Counts Five  Fourteen</italic></center>
The defendants move to strike count five with respect to the Hospital and count fourteen with respect to Hutchings on the ground that the plaintiff improperly alleges a violation of §<cross_reference>17a-540</cross_reference>, a definitions statute. In his memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants' motion to strike, the plaintiff concedes that there was an error in counts five and fourteen of the complaint. As such, the motion to strike counts five and fourteen is granted.

<center>                       <italic>Counts Six, Seven  Fifteen</italic></center>
The defendants move to strike count six with respect to the Hospital and count fifteen with respect to Hutchings on the ground that the plaintiff improperly alleges a violation of §<cross_reference>46a-150</cross_reference>, a definitions statute. In his memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants' motion to strike, the plaintiff concedes that there was an error in counts six and fifteen of the complaint. The same arguments are made by both parties relative to count seven, as well. As such, the motion to strike counts six, seven and fifteen is granted. CT Page 15829

<center>                         <italic>Counts Eight  Sixteen</italic></center>
The defendants move to strike count eight with respect to the Hospital and count sixteen with respect to Hutchings on the ground that the plaintiff failed to provide a good faith certificate pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-190a</cross_reference>. A certificate of good faith, the defendants assert, is required for any claim sounding in medical malpractice due to failure to provide proper medical care or medical negligence. The defendants allege that counts eight and sixteen sound in medical malpractice inasmuch as the claims were brought against both defendants in their capacity as medical professionals, alleging negligence of a specialized medical nature, arising from the medical relationship, and the negligence is substantially related to treatment involving the exercise of medical judgment.

In response to the defendants' motion, the plaintiff asserts that the claims do not sound in medical malpractice, and, therefore, do not require a certificate of good faith. The plaintiff contends that he has not alleged negligence in performing any medical procedure but rather that the defendants failed to provide him medical treatment "after being the cause of the plaintiff's peril." The plaintiff further argues that his claim may be characterized as a simple negligence claim rather than a medical malpractice claim because expert testimony is not required to establish the negligence of the defendants.

"The classification of a negligence claim as either medical malpractice or ordinary negligence requires a court to review closely the circumstances under which the alleged negligence occurred. Professional negligence or malpractice . . . [is] defined as the failure of one rendering professional services to exercise that degree of skill and learning commonly applied under all the circumstances in the community by the average prudent reputable member of the profession with the result of injury, loss, or damage to the recipient of those services . . . [T]he relevant considerations in determining whether a claim sounds in medical malpractice are whether (1) the defendants are sued in their capacities as medical professionals, (2) the alleged negligence is of a specialized medical nature that arises out of the medical professional-patient relationship and (3) the alleged negligence is substantially related to medical diagnosis or treatment and involved the exercise of medical judgment." (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Trimel v.</italic><italic>CT Page 15830</italic><italic>Lawrence  Memorial Hospital Rehabilitation Center,</italic><cross_reference>61 Conn.App. 353</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>357-58</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>764 A.2d 203</cross_reference>, appeal dismissed, <cross_reference>258 Conn. 711</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>784 A.2d 889</cross_reference> (2001); see <italic>Gold v. Greenwich Hospital Assn.,</italic><cross_reference>262 Conn. 248</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>254-55</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>811 A.2d 1266</cross_reference> (2002).

Based on the three-prong test set out in <italic>Trimel,</italic> counts eight and sixteen of the plaintiff's second revised complaint can be properly characterized as claims for medical malpractice rather than ordinary negligence. First, the defendants are medical professionals and are being sued in their capacity as such. Additionally, the complaint alleges that "the defendant Charlotte Hungerford Hospital was charged with the responsibility of providing safe medical and psychological care for the patients entrusted to their care." Likewise, the plaintiff alleges that "the defendant Richard Hutchings was charged with the responsibility of providing safe medical and psychological care for the patients entrusted to his care."

Second, the alleged negligence by the defendants is of a specialized medical nature and arises out of the professional-patient relationship. In his complaint, the plaintiff admits that the defendants' alleged acts of negligence occurred while the plaintiff was a patient at the hospital. The alleged negligent act of failing to treat the plaintiff for injuries sustained from an assault at the hospital was of a specialized medical nature in that it took place at the hospital while the plaintiff was undergoing treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning. The act also arises out of the medical professional-patient relationship because the Hospital and Hutchings were authorized to provide medical care to the plaintiff during his stay at the hospital.

Finally, the defendants' alleged negligence is substantially related to the plaintiff's medical treatment and involved the exercise of medical judgment. In count nine of the complaint, it is alleged that a physical assault on the plaintiff by a hospital employee caused him serious injuries, including "an orbital hemorrhage above the right iris of the right eye, bruises on the left arm, [and] bruising on the face in the area of the right eye." These injuries, which form the basis of the negligence claims, are substantially related to the plaintiff's medical treatment inasmuch as the alleged assault took place during the course of his hospital stay.

Additionally, notwithstanding the plaintiff's argument that no CT Page 15831 expert testimony is required to determine whether the plaintiff should have received medical treatment following the alleged assault, "[t]he characterization of a claim as ordinary negligence or medical malpractice does not turn on whether expert testimony is required." <italic>Trimel v. Lawrence  Memorial Hospital</italic><italic>Rehabilitation Center,</italic> <cross_reference>61 Conn.App. 360</cross_reference>. Accordingly, the plaintiff was required to provide a good faith certificate pursuant to General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-190a</cross_reference> for his claims sounding in medical malpractice against the Hospital and Hutchings. In the absence of such a certificate, the defendants' motion to strike counts eight and sixteen of the second revised complaint is granted.

<center>                              <italic>Count Twenty</italic></center>
The Hospital and Hutchings move to strike count twenty of the second revised complaint on the ground that the plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege that the misconduct of a hospital employee would subject the Hospital to liability on the basis of respondeat superior. The defendants argue in support of its motion that assault is not covered by the doctrine of respondeat superior because it is not an act performed within the scope or in furtherance of an employer's business. Further, the defendants contend that the plaintiff does not allege sufficient facts to determine whether the employee was attempting to "do the Hospital's bidding" or acting for his own benefit.

The plaintiff counters that an employer can be held responsible for any misconduct of an employee that occurs within the scope of employment. Count twenty alleges that an employee of the Hospital assaulted the plaintiff during his inpatient treatment at the Hospital. Inasmuch as the alleged assault took place during the course of his medical treatment, the plaintiff contends that the Hospital is "legally responsible for the acts of its employees pursuant to the common law theory of [r]espondeat [s]uperior."

"Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, [a] master is liable for the wilful torts of his servant committed within the scope of the servant's employment and in furtherance of his master's business . . . While a servant may be acting within the scope of his employment when his conduct is negligent, disobedient and unfaithful . . . that does not end the inquiry. Rather, the vital inquiry in this type of case is whether the servant on the occasion in question was engaged in a disobedient or unfaithful conducting of the master's business, or was engaged CT Page 15832 in an abandonment of the master's business . . . Unless [the employee] was actuated at least in part by a purpose to serve a principal, the principal is not liable." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Mullen v. Horton,</italic> <cross_reference>46 Conn.App. 759</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>764</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>700 A.2d 1377</cross_reference> (1997).

"When the servant is doing or attempting to do the very thing which he was directed to do, the master is liable, though the servant's method of doing it be wholly unauthorized or forbidden. If the servant's disobedience of instructions will exonerate the master, the proof, easily made, virtually does away with the maxim of respondeat superior . . . That the servant disobeyed the orders of the master is never a sufficient defense. It must be shown further that he ceased to act for the master and in the course of his employment." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)<italic>Id.</italic>

"The doctrine of respondeat superior focuses on the employee's conduct rather on the employer's knowledge or approval of the acts. If the employee acted with apparent authority in furtherance of employer business, the employer's consent or ratification of the misconduct is irrelevant . . . even an innocent employer must compensate an injured party." <italic>Glucksman</italic><italic>v. Walters,</italic> <cross_reference>38 Conn.App. 140</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>144-45</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>659 A.2d 1217</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>235 Conn. 914</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>665 A.2d 608</cross_reference> (1995).

Here, it is claimed that the alleged assault took place during the course of the plaintiff's hospital care. This assertion, however, does not present sufficient information to determine whether the employee was attempting to carry out his hospital duties or was acting for his own purposes at the time of the assault. The facts in the present case are similar to those in<italic>Brown v. Housing Authority,</italic> <cross_reference>23 Conn.App. 624</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>583 A.2d 643</cross_reference>
(1990), cert. denied, <cross_reference>217 Conn. 808</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>585 A.2d 1233</cross_reference> (1991). In that case, an assault took place during the time when an employee was driving a van owned by his employer. <italic>Id.</italic> The plaintiff in<italic>Brown</italic> did not allege that the employee was attempting to further the interests of his employer at the time of the incident in question, nor was an assault within the scope of his employment. <italic>Id.</italic> The court in that case held that the employee's "intentional, criminal acts were in no way connected to the [employer's] business." <italic>Id.,</italic> 628. "The mere fact that [the employee] was driving from one job site to another when the assault took place does not change this analysis. `In the course of his employment' means while engaged in the service of the CT Page 15833 master, and it is not synonymous with the phrase `during the period covered by his employment.'" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.</italic>

Similarly, in <italic>Gutierrez v. Thorne,</italic> <cross_reference>13 Conn.App. 493</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>537 A.2d 527</cross_reference> (1988), the court found that an employee at a community residential program was not acting within the scope of his employment when he sexually assaulted a mentally-retarded resident. The court found that there was no respondeat superior liability where the employee's criminal conduct had "no connection with the defendant's business of providing supervision and training to mentally retarded persons." <italic>Id.,</italic> 499. "Since there were no facts before the court from which it could conclude that [the employee] was furthering the defendant's interests, the defendant's nonliabiity under a respondeat superior theory was properly determined as a matter of law." <italic>Id.</italic>

It should be noted that the present case is distinguishable from such cases as <italic>Mullen v. Horton, Glucksman v. Walters,</italic> and<italic>Pelletier v. Bilbiles,</italic> in which employers were held liable for employee misconduct under different factual settings. The court in <italic>Mullen</italic> found that a priest's sexual relationship with the plaintiff during their pastoral-psychological counseling sessions was a "`misguided effort' at psychologically and spiritually counseling the plaintiff, rather than an abandonment of the counseling." <italic>Mullen v. Horton, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>46 Conn.App. 767</cross_reference>. Likewise, in <italic>Glucksman,</italic> the court found that a YMCA's employee's assault on a YMCA member during a basketball game exposed the employer to respondeat superior liability because the assault arose from the employee's responsibility to supervise such sports events. <italic>Glucksman v. Walters, supra,</italic><cross_reference>38 Conn.App. 148</cross_reference>. Lastly, in <italic>Pelletier,</italic> the court upheld a respondeat superior claim of liability on the basis that "the beating of an unruly customer . . . is an extremely forceful, although misguided, method of discouraging patrons . . . from causing disturbances on the premises in the future." <italic>Pelletier v.</italic><italic>Bilbiles,</italic> <cross_reference>154 Conn. 544</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>548</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>227 A.2d 251</cross_reference> (1967).

On the facts presented in this case, the hospital employee allegedly assaulted the plaintiff at some time during the course of the plaintiff's medical treatment. It is not, however, alleged that the employee was attempting to provide care to the plaintiff, rather than acting for his own benefit in committing the alleged assault. In fact the plaintiff alleges in his complaint that his injuries from carbon monoxide poisoning were CT Page 15834 exacerbated by the injuries he sustained due to the assault at the hospital. Accordingly, it is submitted that the Hospital cannot be liable for the alleged assault by an employee under the respondeat superior doctrine. The motion to strike count twenty is granted.

<center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
For the foregoing reasons, the court grants the defendants' motion to strike counts one, two, five, six, seven, eight, ten, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and twenty of the plaintiff's second revised complaint in that these counts fail to allege a legally cognizable cause of action.
