<opinion_text><unpublished>  In a memorandum of decision dated April 25, 2003, the court granted the motion of the plaintiff to disqualify defendants' counsel, Alan Neigher, on the basis of the plaintiff's representation that the plaintiff would be calling Attorney Neigher as a witness at trial.

On April 25, 2003, in response to the court's March 13, 2003 order to do so, the plaintiff provided the court with written notice of the plaintiff's intention to call Attorney Neigher as a witness.

Subsequent to the rendition of the above order, the defendants moved the court for permission to reargue the motion to disqualify. That motion was granted on June 6, 2003 and, after several continuances, the rehearing was conducted on October 14, 2003. The plaintiff was asked to provide the court with an evidentiary basis to support the relief sought in the motion to disqualify. On that date the plaintiff made an offer of proof as to the nature of the testimony which would be elicited from Attorney Neigher as a witness at trial.

The defendants were heard in opposition to the motion to disqualify and extensive reference was made to the defendants' memorandum of law regarding disqualification of counsel.

Having considered the offer of proof made by the plaintiff as to the nature and extent of the testimony which would be elicited from Attorney Neigher, were he to be called as a witness as trial, and having further considered the provisions of Section 3.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and also the case law cited by the defendants in their memorandum of law, the court hereby vacates its order of April 25, 2003, finding that the plaintiff has failed to provide the court with an evidentiary CT Page 14100 basis sufficient to warrant the disqualification of Attorney Neigher as defendants' counsel at trial.

Specific reference is made to the movant's "burden of proving facts which indicate disqualification is necessary." <italic>Roosevelt</italic><italic>Building Product Co., Inc. v.
