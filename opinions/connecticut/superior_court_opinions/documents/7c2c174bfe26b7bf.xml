</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  In this case, plaintiff Michael S. Bracken, Jr. ("Officer Bracken"), a 22-year member of the Windsor Locks (CT) Police Department, has sued Mrs. Barbara O'Charek, of 1 Avon Street, Windsor Locks, to recover money damages for personal injuries he claims to have suffered on the evening of November 20, 1997 when she kicked him in the chest as he was attempting to place her under arrest. In the First Count of her two-count Complaint dated November 17, 1999. Officer Bracken claims that Mrs. O'Charek's act of kicking him was wilful, wanton, malicious and intentional, and thus that she is liable to pay him both compensatory and punitive damages for his complained-of injuries and losses. In the Second Count of her Complaint, the plaintiff claims, in the alternative, that the defendant's challenged conduct was negligent, and thus that she is liable to pay him compensatory damages for his alleged injuries and losses, to wit: injuries to the lungs, including loss of lung capacity; coughing up blood; contusions and abrasions; extensive pain and suffering; severe nervous and emotional upset; shock; the need to expend money for medical care and treatment for the above-described injuries; and lost wages.

Upon the defendant's denial of or plea of insufficient knowledge upon which to admit or deny the essential allegations of the plaintiff's claims against her, this case was tried to this Court, without a jury, on January 27, 2004. After considering the testimony of the parties and their witnesses at trial, together with all the documentary evidence which was submitted for its review, the Court hereby makes the following findings of fact and conclusion of law:

<center>                            <italic>FINDINGS OF FACT</italic></center>
1. On the evening of November 20, 1997, while the plaintiff was CT Page 1207 on duty as a sworn member of the Windsor Locks (CT) Police Department, where he had worked since 1981, he was dispatched to the scene of a disturbance at 472 Litchfield Drive in Windsor Locks, where a female identified as the defendant's daughter, Ms. Stephanie O'Charek, had been heard screaming for help.

2. Upon his arrival at 472 Litchfield Drive, the plaintiff spoke with one of its residents, Mr. David Smith, who reported that after Ms. O'Charek had been heard screaming for someone to leave her alone, she approached his daughter, Ms. Jacqueline Smith, and her friend, Ms. Melanie Corey, who were sitting out front in a car, talking. When Ms. Smith asked Ms. O'Charek, who appeared to be bloody, if she was okay, Ms. O'Charek responded by attacking her and Ms. Corey, ripping off the former's necklace and tearing open the latter's shirt. At or about the time of this attack, Ms. O'Charek's parents, defendant Barbara O'Charek and her husband, Paul O'Charek, came across the street from their nearby residence at 1 Avon Street to subdue their daughter and drag her back home.

3. Upon the arrival of backup, in the persons of Detective Richard Post and Officer Jeffrey Angell, the plaintiff and Detective Post proceeded directly to 1 Avon Street, where they began to knock loudly on the front door.

4. When the loud knocking started, the defendant and her husband became upset and concerned. One consequence of the knocking was to upset the family dog, which ran wildly about the house until the defendant restrained it, at the cost of sustaining a severe bite to her left arm.

5. When Mr. O'Charek answered the door, he was confronted by the plaintiff and Detective Post, who told him that they wanted to see and speak to his daughter Stephanie, who reportedly had attacked two girls after herself being injured. Mr. O'Charek refused this request and stepped outside, closing the door behind him. When the officers pressed him further to let them see and speak to his daughter, informing him that he was interfering with a police investigation by refusing to do so, he thrust out his hands and told them that they might as well arrest him, which they promptly did, placing him in handcuffs in the back of one of their police cruisers.

6. With Mr. O'Charek under arrest, the plaintiff and Detective Post returned with Officer Angell to the front of 1 Avon Street CT Page 1208 with the intention of continuing their efforts to gain access to Stephanie O'Charek. The front door then opened and the defendant appeared in it, with paper towels wrapped around her left arm, which she held tightly to her chest. Upon seeing the defendant, the plaintiff believed that she too had been injured, for he also saw open wounds on the defendant's arm with blood dripping from them. When he asked her if she was okay, however, she stated that she was not injured.

7. The plaintiff then told the defendant, as he and Detective Post had previously told her husband, that they wanted to see and speak to her daughter Stephanie, whom they believed to have been injured, then involved in an altercation. At this request, the defendant slammed closed the front door, catching the plaintiff's foot between the door and the doorframe. Only by pushing back hard on the door could the plaintiff and Detective Post free the plaintiff's foot. Once the foot was so extricated, the door slammed shut and the defendant promptly deadbolted it.

8. Over the next few minutes, the three officers attempted to coax the defendant to cooperate with them. After verbally refusing to cooperate on more than one occasion, the defendant fell silent.

9. When it became apparent that Mrs. O'Charek would not communicate with them, the plaintiff and his back-up officers returned to the Windsor Locks police station with Mr. O'Charek and placed him in a holding cell to await processing. While he was there, a call came into the station from the defendant, asking for the "officer-in-charge." Upon taking the call, Detective Post spoke with the defendant, who told him that she would like to see her husband and, if he was ready, to bail him out. Though initially she was told that he was still being processed and that she could not see him, she was eventually told that she could come down to the station to wait for him.

10. Contemporaneously with telling the defendant that she could come to the police station to wait for her husband, the plaintiff and Detective Post decided that she too should be arrested for interfering with an officer, and that her arrival at the police station would give them the perfect opportunity to effect her arrest without causing a disturbance. The officers determined that upon her arrival they would escort her back into the detention area of the station, ostensibly to see her husband, and there they would arrest her once they had led her into the rear CT Page 1209 detention room.

11. Thus it was that upon the defendant's arrival at the police station, she was promptly ushered into the detention area and escorted, as planned, to the rear detention room, where the events at issue in this lawsuit then unfolded.

12. The plaintiff testified at trial that upon reaching the door to the rear detention room, the defendant took one step inside, saw that her husband was not there as promised, realized that she too was about to be arrested, and forced her way back into the corridor, where she lay down on the floor, flailing her arms and yelling that the officers had lied to her. When she refused the plaintiff's order to get off the floor, he and Detective Post, who had observed the foregoing events, picked her up — the plaintiff by her shoulders, Detective Post by her feet — and carried her into the detention room. Detective Post confirmed this sequence of events in his testimony.

13. Once the defendant was inside the detention room, she again fell to the floor, flailed her arms and refused to be subdued. As the plaintiff bent over her attempting to quiet her, she pulled back both of her legs, then kicked out hard at his chest, knocking him backwards and causing him great pain. Then, after complaining that the officers were going to cause her to have a heart attack, she lay still on the floor as if she had passed out. The police then called for EMTs, who arrived shortly thereafter, restrained the defendant when she became combative with them, and removed her to an ambulance for transportation to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Detective Post confirmed this part of the sequence of events as well.

14. For her part, the defendant testified that upon the arrest of her husband, she telephoned the police department to ask if she could see him and determine when she could post bail for his release. She recalls that in the middle of her conversation with Detective Post, who first told her not to come to the police station because it would take a long time before he would be ready for release, he had a muffled conversation with a third person — by implication the plaintiff — then told her that she could immediately come down to the station and wait in the lobby. Having never been told by the officers at her front door that she was violating the law by not coming to the door or letting them in to see her daughter, she had no idea that by going to the police station she too might be arrested. CT Page 1210

15. The plaintiff reports that when she arrived at the police station, she was met in the front hallway, told she could see her husband in the back, then ushered directly there. On reaching the door to the rear detention room, she recalls, the plaintiff and Detective Post shoved her from behind, pushed her inside the room, then slammed the door behind her. At this, she claims, she was terribly upset, started to hyperventilate, and passed out on the floor of the detention room. The very next thing she claims to recall is waking up in the detention room, with ambulance people there and all the officers and ambulance personnel attempting to restrain her. The plaintiff, she testified, was sitting on her feet, Detective Post was pulling her right hand, and two EMTs were sitting on her head and shoulders. By their efforts, she claims, she was restrained and brought to St. Francis Hospital. The defendant claimed that she didn't "recall" striking the plaintiff because she "was unconscious."

16. This Court has no doubt at all that, in the course of the defendant's arrest at the Windsor Locks police station, she struck the plaintiff in the chest with both of her feet. This conclusion is supported not only by the testimony of the plaintiff and Detective Post, which the defendant, who claims she was unconscious, has not even attempted to contradict, but by the nature of the plaintiff's injuries and the immediacy and severity of the consequences thereof. To begin with, the plaintiff complained at once of pain in his ribs which became more severe with deep breathing, and explained to his treaters at St. Francis Hospital, whom he saw within hours of the defendant's arrest, that the cause of the pain was a kick in the chest which he had sustained "while attempting to restrain a person in custody." Exhibit 2. In the next week, moreover, though an examination of his ribs showed no sign of fracture; Exhibit 4; he continued to experience pain and discomfort in the area of the reported injury and had brief episodes of coughing up blood. Exhibit 3. Because all of these facts support the plaintiff's corroborated account of the defendant kicking him in the chest, the Court finds that that is exactly what she did.

17. The significant question that remains to be answered is with what mental state, if any, did the defendant kick the plaintiff and cause his above-described injuries. At trial, as in his First Count, the plaintiff claimed that the kick was administered intentionally, as evidenced both by the extremely forceful, highly directional nature of the kick itself and by the CT Page 1211 special circumstances in which it occurred. The kick, he testified, began by the cocking of the defendant's legs and was carried out by the simultaneous thrusting of both legs upward and outward, directly at his chest. It occurred, he adds, in circumstances where the defendant was refusing his orders to get up off the floor, where she had dropped, not in an unconscious swoon, but in a desperate act of violent resistance to his and Detective Post's efforts to restrain her. According to the plaintiff and Detective Post, who personally witnessed it, the kick was not merely a chance occurrence, as might have occurred by accident in the course of a fitful flailing of arms and legs, but a purposeful act.

18. The defendant, of course, did not comment on the mental state with which she struck the plaintiff except to disclaim any recollection of so doing after she claims to have hyperventilated and fallen unconscious.

19. The defendant is a diabetic, whose blood sugar, as measured at the hospital when she was brought there, was abnormal. She testified that when her blood sugar is abnormally high, it sometimes affects how she thinks and does things. The defendant does not take insulin for her diabetes, and in fact strongly objected to the proposal that she be injected with it at the emergency room when she was brought there.

20. The defendant also suffers from anxiety attacks, which she claims to experience when she is afraid. The primary consequence of such attacks is allegedly hyperventilation, which causes her to pass out. On the evening in question, the plaintiff claims that she suffered an anxiety attack, with resulting hyperventilation and unconsciousness, when the plaintiff and Detective Post attempted to shove her into the detention room.

21. The Court finds, on the basis of all the evidence, that the defendant was conscious when she kicked the plaintiff, and that she did so intentionally, in the sense that it was her conscious purpose in so doing to resist his efforts to pull her off the detention room floor. She was certainly afraid and angry at that time, as without any warning she had been seized by the officers for the purpose of arresting her after intentionally misleading her to believe that she was about to see her husband Such upsettedness, through readily understandable in the circumstances as she perceived them, gave her a clear and distinct purpose for using force against the plaintiff that shows her conduct to have CT Page 1212 been intentional, not merely accidental, as she has suggested.

22. In addition, the Court finds that the defendant's combative behavior after the arrival of the EMTs is consistent with that of one who never lost consciousness, or with it her physical strength, but instead faked a swoon to scare off the officers for fear they might cause her to have a heart attack. The fact that the defendant resumed her violent resistance to the police and the EMTs as soon as the latter arrived lends strong support to this conclusion, as does the result of the EMTs' test upon her for loss of consciousness, which yielded a negative result. The test, which is described in the police report; Exhibit 7; consists of dropping the limp arm of a seemingly unconscious person onto the person's face. If the person is truly unconscious, the arm will remain where it falls. If the person is not unconscious, the arm will routinely "fall" off the face. When so tested, the defendant's limp arm "fell" off her face, indicating that she was merely faking unconsciousness. <italic>Id.</italic>

23. Finally, though the defendant's alleged fear continued long after she was brought away in the ambulance, then later returned to the police station, she never again hyperventilated, lost consciousness or became irrational in her behavior despite her high blood sugar In conclusion, the Court finds that the defendant kicked the plaintiff in the chest both consciously and intentionally, and that she thereby proximately caused him to suffer the injuries he complained of in his testimony, including chest pain, shortness of breath and coughing up blood. Fortunately, none of these injuries has proven to be permanent.

24. As a direct and proximate result of the above-described injuries, the plaintiff suffered the following economic losses:

<block_quote>  a. lost regular wages of $2,991.48 for four (4) weeks of work, at $787.87 per week, which the plaintiff was unable to put in which convalescing from his injuries.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  b. lost overtime pay of $987.12 at the rate of $29.91 per hour, for thirty-two (32) hours of overtime which the plaintiff was unable to put in while convalescing from his injuries.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  c. medical bills of $410 for reasonable and necessary medical care and treatment provided to him for his CT Page 1213 injuries.</block_quote>

<center>                            <italic>CONCLUSION OF LAW</italic></center>
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby finds by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant intentionally kicked the plaintiff while the plaintiff was attempting to restrain her after luring her, on the false pretense of seeing her recently incarcerated husband, into the detention area of the Windsor Locks police station. As a direct and proximate result of the defendant's kick, the plaintiff endured a week of coughing up blood and a month of chest pain and shortness of breath plus accompanying concern about his own physical condition, but happily no permanent physical or emotional injuries. As a direct and proximate result of these injuries the plaintiff lost four (4) weeks of work, including eight (8) hours per week of overtime pay, and incurred $410 in medical expenses. On the basis of these injuries and losses, the Court awards the plaintiff economic damages of $4,388.60 plus noneconomic damages of $2,500.00.

The Court concludes, however, that this is not an appropriate case in which to award punitive damages, for such damages should properly be reserved for cases in which they can serve the purpose of deterring such conduct in the future — typically, where the defendant's conduct arose from hatred or ill will towards the plaintiff and where it took place without substantial provocation. See <italic>Petrocelli v. Catapano,</italic> <cross_reference>107 Conn. 122</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>123</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>139 A. 634</cross_reference> (1927). Here, it is apparent that the defendant's conduct, though intentional, was not the product of hatred or ill will, but rather of panic which gripped her by surprise as she was tricked by false pretenses to come to the police station and enter the detention area in search of her husband The defendant had no prior criminal record, much less a record of assaultive behavior. She was justifiably panicked by the situation the plaintiff and his fellow officers put her in, even though she was not legally justified in resisting their efforts to arrest her. See generally, General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-23</cross_reference>. The officers' own conduct unnecessarily provoked the reaction which ultimately resulted in the plaintiff's injuries and losses.

<center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
Against this background, and for all the reasons previously stated, the Court hereby ORDERS that judgment enter for the CT Page 1214 plaintiff, on the First Count of his Complaint, as follows:

<block_quote>  Economic damages       $4,388.60 Non-economic damages    2,500.00 Punitive damages          + 0.00 Total damages          $6,888.60</block_quote>

The plaintiff's Second Count, which it pursued in the alternative, is hereby DISMISSED.

IT IS SO ORDERED this 28th day of January 2004.
