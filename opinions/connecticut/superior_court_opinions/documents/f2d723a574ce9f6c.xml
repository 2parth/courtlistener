MEMORANDUM OF DECISION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

</unpublished></opinion_text>
<opinion_byline><unpublished>    HURLEY, J.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>    After a hearing and review of briefs, affidavits and applicable deposition testimony, the court has determined that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the continuing treatment of the plaintiff by the defendant.

Both sides rely on the case of Connell v. Colwell,<cross_reference>214 Conn. 242</cross_reference> (1990) in support of their respective positions. The facts in this case are in dispute as to when the defendant last treated the plaintiff and whether or not there was a continuing cause of treatment or special relationship which would toll the statute of, limitations.

Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

HURLEY, J.
