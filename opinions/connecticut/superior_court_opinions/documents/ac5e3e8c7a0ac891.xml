</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff, Eleanor Reiner, doing business as Intertown Realty, commenced this declaratory judgment action against the defendants, the department of consumer protection and the Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-29</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The plaintiff alleges that she does business as a real estate property management and leasing company. She also alleges that the attorney general informed her in a letter and in meetings that a paragraph of her lease agreements with her tenants and her advertising practices may violate General Statutes §<cross_reference>42-110b</cross_reference>,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), and § -110b-23 (sic)<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants took issue with paragraph six of the lease in which the plaintiff states that a tenant's rent may be increased to cover tax and utility increases, and with her advertisements, which stated that utilities are included in rental prices. The plaintiff further alleges that a controversy has arisen between the parties, that she has no adequate remedy at law, that the Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear her declaratory judgment claim pursuant to § <cross_reference>52-29</cross_reference>, and that any resort to the administrative procedures would be futile. She requests that the court issue a judgment declaring that the challenged paragraph of her lease is valid, and that her advertisements do not violate CUTPA or regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.

Before the court is the defendants' motion to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that the plaintiff has not exhausted her administrative remedies and that the case is not ripe because no case or controversy existed between the state and the plaintiff at the time she filed the action. Issues implicating a court's subject matter jurisdiction include doctrines of justiciability including CT Page 207 ripeness; <italic>Office of the Governor v. Select Committee of</italic><italic>Inquiry,</italic> <cross_reference>271 Conn. 540</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>569</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>858 A.2d 709</cross_reference> (2004); and exhaustion of administrative remedies. <italic>D'Eramo v. Smith,</italic> <cross_reference>273 Conn. 610</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>616</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>872 A.2d 408</cross_reference> (2005).

The defendants argue that the plaintiff's action lacks justiciability because the dispute was not ripe for adjudication at the time the action was filed. Justiciability "requires (1) that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute . . . (2) that the interests of the parties be adverse . . . (3) that the matter in controversy be capable of being adjudicated by judicial power . . . and (4) that the determination of the controversy will result in practical relief to the complainant." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Office</italic><italic>of the Governor v. Select Committee of Inquiry, supra,</italic><cross_reference>271 Conn. 568-69</cross_reference>. The ripeness requirement is designed "to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties. <italic>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,</italic><cross_reference>387 U.S. 136</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>148-49</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S.Ct. 1507</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>18 L.Ed.2d 681</cross_reference> (1967)." <italic>Nizzardo v.</italic><italic>State Traffic Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>259 Conn. 131</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>144-45</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>788 A.2d 1158</cross_reference>
(2002).

The plaintiff's claim is ripe because her supporting affidavit evidences a controversy between the parties. In her affidavit the plaintiff attests that on or about April 19, 2005, she was served with and submitted a copy of a four-count complaint in <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Reiner,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 05 4011103, in which the state alleges that the same portion of the plaintiff's lease and her advertisements, as well as her other practices violate CUTPA. Thus, as of April 19, 2005, a controversy exists between the parties regarding the plaintiff's alleged CUTPA violations. Even though the controversy may not have existed at the time the plaintiff commenced this action, the case is ripe. As the Supreme Court stated in the context of appeals, "ripeness is peculiarly a question of timing, it is the situation <italic>now</italic> rather than the situation at the time of the . . . decision [under review] that must govern." (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Labbe v. Hartford</italic><italic>Pension Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>239 Conn. 168</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>184</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>682 A.2d 490</cross_reference> (1996); see also <italic>Buckley v. Valeo,</italic> <cross_reference>96 S.Ct. 612</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>424 U.S. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>114</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>46 L.Ed.2d 659</cross_reference> (1976). CT Page 208

The defendants also ground their motion to dismiss on the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. "Under our exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine, a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an action that seeks a remedy that could be provided through an administrative proceeding, unless and until that remedy has been sought in the administrative forum . . . In the absence of exhaustion of that remedy, the action must be dismissed." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>D'Eramo v. Smith, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>273 Conn. 616</cross_reference>.

"The doctrine of exhaustion is grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency's findings and conclusions . . . The doctrine . . . furthers the salutary goals of relieving the courts of the burden of deciding questions entrusted to an agency . . . in advance of possible judicial review . . . Most important, a favorable outcome will render review by the court unnecessary [because] as the United States Supreme Court has noted: A complaining party may be successful in vindicating his rights in the administrative process. If he is required to pursue his administrative remedies, the courts may never have to intervene . . . Thus, [t]he two part rationale for the exhaustion doctrine is: (1) to effectuate the legislative intent that the issue in question be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board's judgment . . . and (2) to relieve courts of the burden of prematurely deciding questions that may be resolved satisfactorily though the administrative process . . . Moreover, judicial review may be hindered by the failure of the litigant to allow the agency to make a factual record, or to exercise discretion or apply its expertise . . . [N]otions of administrative autonomy require that the agency be given a chance to discover and correct its own errors . . . [I]t is possible that frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes could weaken the effectiveness of an agency by encouraging people to ignore its procedures." (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Johnson v. Statewide Grievance-Committee,</italic><cross_reference>248 Conn. 87</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>95-96</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>726 A.2d 1154</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1999</cross_reference> Conn. (1999).

"[O]ur case law makes clear that court rules, such as Practice Book <cross_reference>17-55</cross_reference>(3), and broad statutory grants of jurisdiction, such as § <cross_reference>52-29</cross_reference>, are not intended to circumvent the well established CT Page 209 principles of exhaustion." <italic>River Bend Associates, Inc. v.</italic><italic>Simsbury Water Pollution Control Authority,</italic> <cross_reference>262 Conn. 84</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>106</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>809 A.2d 492</cross_reference> (2002). "[Section] <cross_reference>52-29</cross_reference>, granting declaratory judgment jurisdiction to the Superior Court, does not qualify as the type of separate statutory authorization . . . that allows for a complete bypassing of an administrative agency with undeniable jurisdiction over the subject matter . . ." (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Id.,</italic> 105.

Here, the defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to pursue the appropriate administrative remedy offered under § <cross_reference>21a-1-10</cross_reference> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Section<cross_reference>21a-1-10</cross_reference>(a), which applies to the department of consumer protection, provides in relevant part: "Any interested person may present a request for a declaratory ruling from the department regarding the applicability of any statute or regulation administered by the department to any practice described in such request . . . The ruling will be made by the department within a reasonable time after the submission of the request and a copy of such ruling will be mailed to the petitioner." Additionally, subsection (b) provides: "Within 30 days following the receipt of a petition, the commissioner shall determine whether to deny or to grant it. If he denies the petition, he shall notify the petitioner of his decision in writing. If the petition is granted, the commissioner shall make a ruling and send it to the petitioner. Any such ruling shall have the same effect as a final decision in a contested case."

"Where a statutory requirement of exhaustion is not explicit, courts are guided by [legislative] intent in determining whether application of the doctrine would be consistent with the statutory scheme . . . Consequently, [t]he requirement of exhaustion may arise from explicit statutory language or from an administrative scheme providing for agency relief." (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Johnson v. Statewide</italic><italic>Grievance Committee, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>248 Conn. 96-97</cross_reference>.

Although it does not appear that our courts have construed or discussed § <cross_reference>21a-1-10</cross_reference>, courts have decided that General Statutes §<cross_reference>4-176</cross_reference>, when coupled with similar agency regulations that allow an aggrieved party to petition a commissioner for a declaratory ruling and for judicial review of that ruling, provide the party with an adequate administrative remedy if they enable the party to seek the same remedy she seeks in Superior Court and they supply a mechanism for judicial review of the administrative CT Page 210 declaratory ruling. <italic>Housing Authority v. Papandrea,</italic><cross_reference>222 Conn. 414</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>610 A.2d 637</cross_reference> (1992). Section <cross_reference>4-176</cross_reference> provides: "(a) Any person may petition an agency, or an agency may on its own motion initiate a proceeding, for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation, or the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes, a regulation, or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency. (b) Each agency shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that provide for (1) the form and content of petitions for declaratory rulings, (2) the filing procedure for such petitions and (3) the procedural rights of persons with respect to the petitions." Because the statute and the regulations enacted thereunder provide an adequate administrative process designed to handle declaratory rulings, our Supreme Court has found that a trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction if the plaintiff failed to exhaust such administrative remedies. <italic>Id.</italic>

In the present case, both the statute and the regulation create exhaustion hurdles. It appears that the department adopted § 21-1-10 pursuant to the requirement of § <cross_reference>4-176</cross_reference>(b) that it adopt regulations establishing a procedure for obtaining declaratory rulings. The regulation, like the regulation at issue in <italic>Housing</italic><italic>Authority v. Papandrea,</italic> allows a party to petition the commission for a declaratory ruling regarding the "applicability of any statute or regulation issued by the department . . ." Regs., Conn. State Agencies § 21-1-10. Although the regulation does not expressly provide for judicial review of the ruling, such review is available under General Statutes <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference>, in that the regulation states that it "shall have the same effect as a final decision in a contested case" and § <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference> provides in relevant part: "A person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision may appeal to the Superior Court . . ." Thus, the plaintiff could have filed a petition for a declaratory ruling pursuant to § 21-1-10 asking the department to determine her rights with regard to whether her lease and advertisement practices violate CUTPA or the department's regulations. Had the plaintiff received an adverse ruling, she would have a clear right to appeal to the court pursuant to § <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference>. Therefore, because the available administrative procedure provides the plaintiff with a mechanism for attaining the remedy that she seeks, and because the plaintiff could have appealed any adverse declaratory ruling to the Superior Court pursuant to § <cross_reference>4-183</cross_reference>, the plaintiff was required to seek such a ruling before seeking CT Page 211 redress in this court. <italic>Housing Authority v. Papandrea, supra,</italic><cross_reference>222 Conn. 414</cross_reference>; see also <italic>Polymer Resources, Ltd. v. Keeney,</italic><cross_reference>227 Conn. 545</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>630 A.2d 1394</cross_reference> (1993).

The plaintiff, however, counters that any resort to the administrative process would have been futile because the attorney general, as the top enforcement officer of the department of consumer protection, had already charged and convicted the defendant in the court of public opinion thereby creating an unfair bias. "One of the limited exceptions to the exhaustion rule arises when recourse to the administrative remedy would be demonstrably futile or inadequate . . . It is well established that [a]n administrative remedy is futile or inadequate if the agency is without authority to grant the requested relief . . . It is futile to seek a remedy only when such action <italic>could not</italic> result in a favorable decision and<italic>invariably</italic> would result in further judicial proceedings." (Citations omitted; emphasis in the original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Neiman v. Yale University,</italic> <cross_reference>270 Conn. 244</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>258-59</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>851 A.2d 1165</cross_reference> (2004).

"[F]utility is more than a mere allegation that the administrative agency might not grant the relief requested. In most instances . . . the failure to exhaust an administrative remedy is permissible only when the administrative remedy would be useless." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Johnson v.</italic><italic>Statewide Grievance Committee, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>248 Conn. 104</cross_reference>. "[U]tilizing administrative remedies is not futile for purposes of the futility exception even when the decision maker has indicated that it will rule against the grievant." <italic>Neiman v.</italic><italic>Yale University, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>270 Conn. 259</cross_reference>.

Here, the administrative remedy is useful and not futile. Pursuant to § <cross_reference>4-176</cross_reference> and § 21-1-10, the department has the authority to grant a declaratory ruling which would provide the plaintiff with the same relief she requests from this court. As stated previously, this remedy could provide the plaintiff with a declaration of her rights and a mechanism for judicial review of the department's decision. A declaratory ruling from the department would be useful to both the court and the plaintiff, in that a ruling favoring the plaintiff's position would provide the court with the agency's position and application of its expertise and it would dispense the plaintiff's need to resort to the judicial process. It is noted that the conflict between the plaintiff and the attorney general about the lease provision CT Page 212 arose as early as November 26, 2004, if not before. A request to the department for a declaratory ruling then would have provided the agency with the opportunity to apply its expertise to the conflict, and a request to the department now will afford the agency an opportunity to provide the court with the department's position; and to reconsider or correct a mistaken position, notwithstanding the pendency of the action brought by the state.

Furthermore, the plaintiff's contention, that the futility exception should apply because the attorney general has allegedly indicated a bias against her assumes that any bias the attorney general holds automatically transfers to the department. It ignores the fact that the department and the attorney general are two separate entities. See General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>21a-1</cross_reference>,<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>
3-125,<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> and § <cross_reference>21a-1-10</cross_reference>(b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. Section <cross_reference>21a-1</cross_reference> specifically places the department under the direction and supervision of the commissioner of consumer protection, not the attorney general.

Section <cross_reference>21a-1-10</cross_reference>(b) of the department's regulations states that the commissioner shall make the declaratory ruling. There is no indication that the attorney general has anything to do with the process of providing the plaintiff with an administrative declaratory ruling remedy. Furthermore, although § <cross_reference>3-125</cross_reference> states, "[the Attorney General] shall advise or give his opinion to the head of any executive department or any state board or commission upon any question of law submitted to him"; even if the department asked the attorney general for his opinion, the statute does not provide that his opinion would be binding on the department's proceeding and pertains to questions of law and not of fact.

"Because of the policy behind the exhaustion doctrine, [the court] construe[s] the [futility or inadequacy] exceptions narrowly." <italic>Stepney, LLC v. Fairfield,</italic> <cross_reference>263 Conn. 558</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>565</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>821 A.2d 725</cross_reference> (2003). "[T]here is a presumption . . . that administrative board members acting in an adjudicative capacity are not biased . . . To overcome the presumption, the plaintiff . . . must demonstrate <italic>actual bias,</italic> rather than <italic>mere potential</italic><italic>bias</italic> . . . unless the circumstances indicate a probability of such bias too high to be constitutionally tolerable." (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>OG</italic><italic>Industries, Inc. v. Planning  Zoning Commission,</italic> <cross_reference>232 Conn. 419</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>429</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>655 A.2d 1121</cross_reference> (1995). Finally, this presumption and the distinction between the department and the attorney general CT Page 213 indicates that the plaintiff's reliance on <italic>Clisham v. Board of</italic><italic>Police Commissioners, supra,</italic> <cross_reference>223 Conn. 354</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>613 A.2d 254</cross_reference>, to support her argument is misplaced. In <italic>Clisham,</italic> the court determined that the plaintiff's right to due process was violated because the actual bias and prejudice of the members of the board that were reviewing the plaintiff's conduct fueled their own decision to dismiss the plaintiff. In the present case, construing the futility exception narrowly, the plaintiff has not demonstrated actual bias by the department.

<center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
Because the plaintiff was required to seek a declaratory ruling before seeking redress in this court but failed to do so, she has not exhausted her administrative remedies, and the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Therefore, the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted.
