</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This is an application to vacate an arbitration award brought by the Connecticut State Employees Association, on behalf of Bryan Sousa, an employee of the Department of Environmental Protection. The defendant State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection terminated the employee, Bryan Sousa for his alleged failure to report to work on account of two separate five-day periods of absence and for what were alleged to be offensive comments. The union and the defendant (DEP) are parties to a written collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for arbitration of disputes between the parties. Pursuant to the agreement the union filed for arbitration over the dismissal from state service of Bryan Sousa.

The parties stipulated to the following unrestricted submission to the arbitrator:

<block_quote>  Was the termination of the grievant's employment from state service pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>5-240</cross_reference> and § <cross_reference>5-248</cross_reference> for just cause?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  If not, what shall the remedy be consistent with the contract?</block_quote>

The award of the arbitrator was as follows:

<block_quote>  The termination of Bryan Sousa's employment from state service pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. §  <cross_reference>5-240</cross_reference> and § <cross_reference>5-248</cross_reference> was for just cause.</block_quote>

The State has filed a cross application to confirm the arbitration award. The arbitrator has filed a very complete and thoughtful decision and award containing seventy-three pages. The union bases its application to vacate on three grounds. (1) Violation of Section CT Page 10488<cross_reference>52-418</cross_reference>(a)(4) claiming that the award of the arbitrator exceeded its powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award was not made. (2) The award does not draw its essence from the contract and (3) The award violates public policy and/or is in manifest disregard of the law and the common law.

In its cross application to confirm the arbitration award, the State maintained that the award conforms to the unrestricted submission.

Each party has filed a memorandum of law. The union has attached to its memo four exhibits. (1) Termination letter, (2) Letter from Dr. Marcia Trape to Sandra Katie, Personnel Officer of the DEP, (3) Copy of Governor's Executive Order No. 16, (4) Copy of the DEP's telecommuting program. The file contains a complete copy of the arbitrator's decision and award.

Relevant legal principles to this case are contained in a brief summary of the recent case of <italic>Enfield v. AFSCME, Council 4, Local</italic><italic>1029</italic>, <cross_reference>100 Conn.App. 470</cross_reference> (2007). Citations and quotation marks are omitted.

<block_quote>  The Standard of Review relative to arbitration awards depends on the nature of the challenge. With a voluntary unrestricted submission to an arbitrator. . . the Court may only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission. . . In making such a comparison when the submission is unrestricted, the Court will not review the evidence or legal questions involved, but is bound by the arbitrator's legal and factual determinations. . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Certain conditions do exist, however, under which we conduct a more searching review of arbitral awards. In <italic>Garrity v. McCaskey</italic>, <cross_reference>223 Conn. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>6</cross_reference>
(1992), our Supreme Court reiterated that there are three grounds for vacating an award when the submission is unrestricted. These grounds arise when the award (1) rules on the constitutionality of a statute, (2) violates clear public policy or (3) contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of Conn. Gen. Stat. § <cross_reference>52-418</cross_reference>.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  When a challenge to a voluntary arbitration award CT Page 10489 rendered pursuant to an unrestricted submission raises a legitimate and colorful claim of violation of public policy, the question of whether the award violates public policy requires de novo judicial review. . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  The public policy exception applies only when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy. . . A challenge that an award is in contradiction of public policy is premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a Court to enforce such a contract between them. . . When a challenge to the arbitrator's authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the Court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator's decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award. . . Accordingly, the public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] Court's refusal to enforce an arbitrator's interpretation of [collective bargaining agreement] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests. . . The party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Both parties agree that the submission in this case is unrestricted.</block_quote>

The union relies upon Governor Rowland's Executive Order No. 16 and on Title One of the American's with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)<cross_reference>42 U.S.C. §§ 12101</cross_reference>-<cross_reference>17</cross_reference> (1994), establishing a public policy ensuring that all employees in state government should have a safe, secure work place free from intimidation and harassment. As can be seen from the very detailed decision and award of the arbitrator, all pertinent facts, arguments and evidence were considered by the arbitrator in arriving at the award. In CT Page 10490 the opinion of the Court the award does not violate either of the two public policy principles raised by the union. The arbitrator reached a legally justifiable conclusion. "The public policy exception applies only when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy." <italic>State v. New England Health Care Employees, Dist.</italic> 1199,<cross_reference>265 Conn. 771</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>783</cross_reference> (2003).

"Our Supreme Court has determined that in reviewing questions of fact in arbitration proceedings, a reviewing Court must determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the arbitrator's findings of fact and whether the conclusions drawn from these facts are reasonable. . . The limited scrutiny with which we review and arbitration panel's findings of fact dictates that it is neither the function of the Trial Court. . . to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the arbitration panel." (Citations omitted.)<italic>Board of Police Commissioners v. Stanley</italic>, <cross_reference>92 Conn.App. 723</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>733-34</cross_reference>
(2005).

Even in the context of de novo review we defer to the arbitrators' factual determination, <italic>Groton v. United Steel Workers of America</italic>,<cross_reference>254 Conn. 52</cross_reference> (2000).

The Court may examine an arbitrator's memorandum to determine whether the arbitrator was faithful to the obligation under the submission, but, unless the arbitrator's memorandum reveals patent infidelity to the obligation under the submission, the result reached by the award and not the memorandum controls. <italic>City of New Britain v. Board of Mediation and</italic><italic>Arbitration</italic>, <cross_reference>178 Conn. 557</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>562</cross_reference> (1979). When the parties submitted the grievance to arbitration, they delegated to the arbitrator by the submission agreement, the power to answer and award on the issue. By agreeing to an unlimited submission, the parties authorize the arbitrator to exercise her own judgment and discretion in rendering an award. "Since the global, unrestricted submission granted ample authority for the answer it can not now be said that the arbitrator exceeded her authority." <italic>Board of Education v. Bridgeport Education</italic><italic>Association</italic>, <cross_reference>183 Conn. 287</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>293-94</cross_reference> (1977). The union cannot now complain that the arbitrator exceeded her power when it agreed to and voluntarily joined in the request as submitted to and decided by the arbitrator.<italic>Board of Education v. Waterbury Teacher's Association</italic>, <cross_reference>174 Conn. 123</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>128-29</cross_reference> (1977).

"Every reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the award and of the arbitrators' acts and proceedings. Hence, the burden rests on the party attacking the award to produce evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it. . . Thus in deciding whether CT Page 10491 arbitrators have exceeded their powers, as the phrase is used in §<cross_reference>52-418</cross_reference>(d),<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> the Court need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission. . . the submission in the present case was unrestricted and the parties thereby empower the arbitrators to decide both factual and legal disputes. . . moreover, the parties by the unrestricted submission relieve the arbitrators of the obligation to follow strict rules of law and evidence in reaching their decision." <italic>Norwich R.C. Diocese Corporation v. So.</italic><italic>N.E. Contracting Company</italic>, <cross_reference>164 Conn. 472</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>476</cross_reference>, 77 (1973). In the opinion of this Court the award conforms to the submission.

The application to vacate the award is denied.

The State's cross-application to confirm the arbitration award is granted.
