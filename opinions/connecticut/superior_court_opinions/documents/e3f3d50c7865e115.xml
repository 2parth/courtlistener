<center>                                 BACKGROUND</center>
On April 26, 2007, and May 31, 2007, the defendant Brocros Realty Corporation (Brocros) executed two mortgages and notes to the named plaintiff for real property located in the City of Waterbury. The first note in the principal amount of Two Million Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,850,000.00) was a blanket mortgage on property located at 889 Woodtick Road, 911 Woodtick Road, 923 Woodtick Road, 25 Sharon Road and 31 Sharon Road.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> This property is known as the Huntington Court Apartments a 60-unit apartment complex. The second note dated May 31, 2007 executed by Brocros in the amount of Four Million Seven Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($4,725,000.00) was for a mortgage on property located at 1129 Wolcott Street which is known as the Wyndham Court Apartments an 84-unit apartment complex. On April 29, 2009, the named plaintiff commenced foreclosure proceedings on both of these notes and mortgages due to the defendant's default for payment. The parties agree that the last mortgage payment was made in November 2008. On June 2, 2009, Astoria assigned to Woodtick Mews LLC, the note and Mortgage on the Woodtick and Sharon Road Property.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> On June 9, 2009, Astoria assigned the second note on the Wolcott Street property to Juda J. Epstein, Trustee, who subsequently assigned this note and mortgage to Wyndham Court, LLC on July 14, 2009.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> On July 17, 2009, the substituted plaintiffs, Wyndham Court, LLC and Woodtick Mews LLC, filed a joint motion pursuant to Practice Book Section 21-20 et seq., for a receiver of rents to be appointed. The court heard evidence and argument on this motion on August 11, 2009.

<center>                                  ARGUMENT</center>
The plaintiffs claim in their motion for the appointment of a receiver CT Page 14505 that the security of said parties will be jeopardized if 1) the tenants are permitted to maintain the premises for an extended period of time without payments of rents and 2) any equity in the property is speedily diminishing. Their main argument is that 1) there is presently negative equity in both properties 2) that the property taxes are not being paid on either property further diminishing the value 3) and waste is being committed on the property. The defendant objects to the appointment of a receiver. The defendant claims the reasons for the default are twofold. First the real property taxes due to the City of Waterbury have doubled since their purchase of the properties in 2007 and a turnover in the tenants which occurred as a result of rental increases to bring the rents in line with current market prices. The defendant argues that other than the nonpayment of the mortgages and the July 1, 2009 property tax bills, the properties are being properly maintained. The rents are being collected, the properties are properly insured, and that all repairs and maintenance to sustain the value of the properties is being performed.

The criteria upon which a motion for an appointment of a receiver of rents is set forth in <italic>Antonio v. Johnson</italic>, <cross_reference>113 Conn.App. 72</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>77</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>967 A.2d 261</cross_reference>, (2009), where the Connecticut Appellate Court stated at pages 77-78, "An action of foreclosure is peculiarly equitable and the court may entertain all questions which are necessary to be determined in order that complete justice may be done between the parties." <italic>Hartford</italic><italic>Federal Savings  Loan Ass'n. v. Tucker</italic>, <cross_reference>196 Conn. 172</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>175</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>491 A.2d 1084</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>474 U.S. 920</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>106 S.Ct. 250</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>88 L.Ed.2d 258</cross_reference>
(1985). "The application for a receiver is addressed to the sound legal discretion of the court, to be exercised with due regard to the relevant statutes and rules, and such exercise is not to be disturbed lightly nor unless abuse of discretion or other material error appears." <italic>Chatfield</italic><italic>Co. v. Coffey Laundries, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>111 Conn. 497</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>501</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>150 A. 511</cross_reference>, (1930). Our courts have considered a number of equitable factors when deciding whether to appoint a receiver of rents, including: (1) whether waste or loss is occurring; <italic>Hartford Federal Savings  Loan Ass'n. v. Tucker,</italic><italic>supra</italic>, <cross_reference>196 Conn. 175</cross_reference>; (2) the risk to the foreclosing party that he will recover less than the full amount of his debt, that is, whether the deficiency is certain or only threatened; e.g., <italic>Prudential Ins. Co. of</italic><italic>America v. Calabrese</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV-95-0127550-S (August 11, 1995) Page 78 (15 Conn. L. Rptr. 13); and (3) whether there are provisions in lending documents that allow or require the appointment of a receiver in the event of the mortgagor's default; <italic>Jewett City Savings Bank v. Weiss</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Windham, Docket No. CV-96-0053937-S (November 21, 1996) (holding that when mortgage deed permits appointment of receiver and there is likely deficiency after foreclosure, court may grant motion to appoint receiver); see also <italic>Cross v. O'Neil</italic>, Superior Court, judicial CT Page 14506 district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-02-0189033-S (December 6, 2002) (33 Conn. L. Rptr. 449); <italic>Webster Bank, N.A. v. Belinda Co.</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV-05-4004042-S (February 16, 2006).

The evidence presented by the plaintiffs shows that the present debt on the Wyndham Court property including the July 1, 2009, property taxes (which as of 8/11/09 have not been paid) is Five Million Six Hundred Fifty-Two thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-One Dollars and sixty-three cents ($5,652,871.63) and the appraised value is Five Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,300,000.00). The debt due and owing on Huntington Court including the unpaid July 1, 2009 property taxes, is Three Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Five dollars and ninety-five cents ($3,350,995.95); appraised value of this property is Three Million Three Hundred Twelve Thousand Five Hundred dollars ($3,312,500.00).<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

The question though, for the court to decide is whether or not waste is being committed to the properties and would an appointment of a receiver, an extraordinary remedy, which has a cost factor would improve the situation on the properties. In this regard the court heard no evidence that the properties are not being properly maintained or that they have fallen into disrepair. The evidence presented to the court is that the properties are being maintained, the rents are being collected, the utility bills are current and the occupancy rate is excellent.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>
As for the unpaid real property taxes, there was testimony that an arrangement had been made with the Waterbury Tax Collector to bring the taxes current by October 31, 2009. In addition, the defendant has hired an experienced property manager as a consultant to review the procedures in place and to rectify any problems.

The court finds based upon the documentary evidence and testimony presented that the appointment of a receiver is not warranted at this time. Though there may be negative equity in both properties at this time, the court finds the evidence presented is insufficient to show the properties are deteriorating or that waste is occurring. The plaintiffs should simply pursue their foreclosure action. The substituted plaintiffs' motion for an appointment of a receiver is denied.
