</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The original complaint in this action was brought by Midland Credit Management Corporation to collect monies allegedly owing on a credit card account. A request to amend the complaint has been filed; in the proposed amended complaint it is stated that on a date before the commencement of litigation the credit card account was sold by Midland Credit to MRC Receivables Corporation and all rights in connection with the account were thereby assigned to MRC Receivables. In other words, the amendment seeks to add MRC Receivables as the proper party. The amended complaint, in other respects, does not change, add to, or subtract from the allegations of the original complaint regarding the debt allegedly owed. To the original complaint and before the request to amend the defendant had filed a counterclaim against the original plaintiff, Midland Credit, under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.

The defendant has now filed an objection to the motion to amend and a motion to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction; it is said that Midland Credit, because it was not the owner of the debt when suit was first brought has no standing and "the complaint is without jurisdiction and must be dismissed." It is the court's opinion that merely because the words "standing" and "jurisdiction" are put in issue that does not dictate a common sense application of our rules should not be relied upon which in turn define the ambit of these general concepts.

The relevant practice book section is § 9-20 which says "when any action has been commenced in the name of the wrong party as plaintiff, the judicial authority may, if satisfied that it was so commenced through mistake and that it is necessary for the determination of the real matter in dispute so to do, allow any other person to be substituted or added as plaintiff." To quote the commentary to this rule in Connecticut Practice, Horton 
CT Page 7291 Knox p. 393: "This section prevents the failure of an action when the wrong person is named as plaintiff. If a motion is granted to substitute the correct plaintiff the motion relates back to commencement of the suit." <italic>FDIC v. Retirement Management Group,</italic><italic>Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>31 Conn. App. 80</cross_reference> . . . This section applies to the assignee when the assignor improperly brought the action, <italic>U.S. Trust Co.</italic><italic>v. DiGhello,</italic> <cross_reference>179 Conn. 246</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>247</cross_reference>, note 1 . . . (1979), or to an assignor when the assignee improperly brought the action. <italic>Bowen</italic><italic>v. National Life Association,</italic> <cross_reference>63 Conn. 460</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>474-77</cross_reference> . . . (1893).<italic>Bowen</italic> is especially important because it allowed the substitution of the correct plaintiff after the statute of limitations has run." The Retirement Management case is especially interesting since it cites a federal case to the following effect . . . "See also <italic>Health Research Group v.</italic><italic>Kennedy,</italic> <cross_reference>82 F.R.D. 21</cross_reference> (D.D.C., 1979) (substitution of real party in interest as plaintiff permitted to cure lack of standing of original plaintiff)." <cross_reference>31 Conn. App. at p. 85</cross_reference>. <italic>Goodrich v.</italic><italic>Alfred,</italic> <cross_reference>72 Conn. 257</cross_reference> (1899), does not contradict this approach. At page 260 the court said: "Had Beulah Shanley brought this suit, that part of the common counts relative to sales would have been an appropriate general statement of the nature of her demand; but it was not an appropriate general statement of the right of one to whom she had assigned her claim and of the violation of this right by a refusal to make payment to him . . . The defect in the proceedings inhered in their origin and was substantial." — So far so good for the defendant. But at p. 261 the court notes: "It is to be observed that no motion was made for a change in parties." Perhaps even more to the point is the comment that the plaintiff in <italic>Goodrich</italic> "could not be helped out by allowing him to file a supplemental complaint for a wrong of which his original complaint contained no suggestion." <italic>Id.</italic> p. 260, cf. along these lines, the case of <italic>Johndrow v. State,</italic><cross_reference>24 Conn. App. 719</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>722</cross_reference>, see especially footnote 1 which is like the<italic>Goodrich</italic> case insofar as the just quoted comment is concerned. The original complaint in this matter asserted a cause of action specifying an identifiable alleged debt under a credit card agreement and claiming an exact sum purportedly due and owing. The requirements of due process notice certainly do not require the actual service of process.

Nor would the addition of the proper party present the problem discussed in <italic>The Cadle Company v. Schlictmanet,</italic> <cross_reference>338 F.3d 2003</cross_reference>
(CA 1, 2003). The nature of the underlying claim and the defenses to this discrete claim qua claim will not be changed and the counterclaim will still be viable against the party who now CT Page 7292 claims it is not the proper party in interest. In fact the only basis to overrule any objection to the addition of the new party and to deny the dismissal would have to be in the context of the continued viability of the counterclaim which Midland Credit appears to recognize.

In other words, Midland Credit by its attempt to add what it characterizes as the proper party in interest cannot insulate itself from the consequences of having brought the suit initially under the representation that it did so by mistake. That is, the "mistake" in bringing the original suit in behalf of Midland Credit may not have been so innocent according to the plaintiff But it can still be characterized as a "mistake" in Practice Book<cross_reference>9-20</cross_reference> terms in the sense that the original claim is not really viable with Midland Credit as plaintiff since it does not own the debt.

In any event if Practice Book <cross_reference>9-20</cross_reference> does not apply here when would it? And as long as the counterclaim is not rendered a nullity by the addition of MRC Receivables Corporation the court need not add to any confusion to the rules on substitution and addition of parties by embellishing the definition of "mistake" as used in the rule.

The objection to the request to amend the complaint and the motion to dismiss are denied.
