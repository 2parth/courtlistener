<opinion_text><unpublished>  The court has reviewed the record certified to it by the Board of Review, the defendant's memorandum of law, the plaintiff's pleading and has considered the plaintiff's remarks that he made at the short calendar of July 12, 2001. The decision of the Board of Review follows reasonably from the facts found and correctly applies the law to those facts. The decision is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law. The decision is affirmed. The appeal is dismissed

BY THE COURT,
