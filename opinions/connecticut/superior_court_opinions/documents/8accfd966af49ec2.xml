<opinion_text><unpublished>  This is an action involving a motor vehicle collision on May 25, 2007. The plaintiff, Michelle Howard, has alleged in her complaint that at the time of the collision, the other vehicle was being operated by the defendant Leilany Gonzalez and was owned by the defendant Evelyn Gombos.

The defendant, Evelyn Gombos, has moved this court for a summary judgment arguing that there are no genuine issues of material fact that Gombos did not own the motor vehicle allegedly driven by the defendant Gonzalez. Additionally, she argues that even if her ownership of the vehicle at the time of the collision was established, summary judgment should enter on her behalf because there is no genuine issue of material fact that she was not related to the named driver, Gonzalez, nor was Gonzalez ever her agent, servant or employee.

To establish her claims, Gombos has provided the court with her own affidavit that those facts are true and accurate.

The plaintiff has objected to the relief sought in the motion for summary judgment and argues that the movant has failed to meet her burden of showing that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to ownership or as to Gonzalez's permission and/or authorization to operate the vehicle.

"Practice Book . . . [ยง 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . . . In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<italic>Miles v. Foley</italic>, <cross_reference>253 Conn. 381</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>385-86</cross_reference> (2000).

In opposing a motion for summary judgment, a party is not required to CT Page 17186 present evidence necessary to prevail at trial, only evidence sufficient to raise issues of fact. <italic>Vaillancourt v. Latifi</italic>, <cross_reference>81 Conn.App. 541</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>544</cross_reference>
(2004).

As noted, the plaintiff has alleged in her complaint that on May 25, 2007, the date of the collision, the other vehicle was driven by the defendant Leilany Gonzalez and was owned by the defendant Evelyn Gombos.

To establish her claim that she was not the owner of the vehicle on that date, Gombos has filed an affidavit in which she swears that she was not the owner on the date in question, having sold the vehicle to Renaldo Morales "in February 2007."

The movant goes on to argue that even if she had owned the vehicle on that date, she was not related to the operator, Gonzalez, nor was Gonzalez using the vehicle as Gombos' agent, servant or employee. Those facts are also set forth in Gombos' affidavit in support of her motion. For those reasons she argues that she can not be held liable to the plaintiff pursuant to either ยง <cross_reference>52-182</cross_reference>, C.G.S. or ยง <cross_reference>52-183</cross_reference>, C.G.S.

The plaintiff has objected to the relief in the motion for summary judgment. She argues that evidence exists, and/or can be produced for trial, which contradicts Gombos' denial of ownership.

Specifically, she is prepared to prove that on the date of the accident, May 25, 2007, the vehicle in question was listed as a covered vehicle on Gombos' insurance policy. She also is prepared to prove that as of February 14, 2008, more than eight months after the date of the collision, the Department of Motor Vehicles still listed the vehicle as registered to Gombos.

The plaintiff also cites what she describes as deficiencies in the alleged bill of sale from Gombos to Renaldo Morales, which Gombos relies upon to evidence the fact that she sold the car prior to the collision. Those deficiencies include the lack of a date of sale on the bill of sale and the lack of other essential information such as the address of the seller and the address of the buyer.

The plaintiff also argues that the sworn statement of Gombos that Gonzalez is not her relative and that Gonzalez is and was not ever her agent, servant or employee, unsupported by any documentary or other corroborative evidence is not sufficient to meet her burden in overcoming the statutory presumption that Gonzalez was using her car with permission and/or authorization.

Having considered the concerns raised by the plaintiff in her objection, the court finds that the movant has failed to adequately establish that no genuine issues of fact exist as to either her ownership of the car or as to Gonzalez's presumed permitted use of the car at the time of the collision.

For those reasons, the motion for summary judgment is hereby denied.
