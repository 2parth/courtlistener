</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This action involves breach of warranty claims asserted by the plaintiff with respect to a 2000 Freightliner Truck purchased by the plaintiff on December 8, 1999. The defendants originally included New England Truck Sales and Service, Inc. ("New England"), a Freightliner dealer located in Branford which sold the truck to plaintiff, Freightliner Corporation ("Freightliner"), the manufacturer of the truck and Eaton Corporation ("Eaton"), the manufacturer of the transmission installed in the truck. The court (Gilardi, J.), granted motions for summary judgment in favor of New England and Freightliner, leaving Eaton as the sole remaining defendant. The case was tried to the court on October 22 and 23, 2008. Following conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence the court granted Eaton's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's fourth count (claiming unjust enrichment) and fifth count (claiming violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act — CUTPA), pursuant to Practice Book § <cross_reference>15-5</cross_reference> for failure to make out a prima facie case. The court denied Eaton's motion to dismiss the sixth count, the sole remaining count alleging breach of warranty by Eaton.

The evidence established the following facts. The Freightliner truck was purchased by the plaintiff on December 8, 1999 as a new vehicle. Financing for the purchase of the truck was provided by Newcourt Small Business Lending Corp. ("Newcourt"). The manufacturer of the engine, Cummins, and the manufacturer of the transmission installed in the truck, Eaton, issued original equipment warranties to the plaintiff as purchaser. The basic Eaton warranty covered the transmission for three years or 300,000 miles. The plaintiff also purchased an extended warranty from Eaton extending the warranty to five years or 500,000 miles. After the plaintiff purchased the truck, it was driven by her uncle for commercial freight hauling.

In late September 2001, the truck broke down in Pennsylvania while being driven by the plaintiff's uncle. The truck was towed to the nearest Freightliner repair facility, Horwith Trucks, Inc., in Northhampton, CT Page 20370 Pennsylvania. The engine and the transmission were partially disassembled by Horwith in order to assess the truck's condition and to provide the plaintiff an estimate of repair costs. At the plaintiff's request, Horwith notified Cummins and Eaton in case the repairs might be covered by warranty. The truck had 262,001 miles on the odometer when it broke down. Since less than three years had elapsed since the purchase, the transmission was covered by Eaton's basic warranty.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

The truck was inspected at Horwith by representatives of both Cummins and Eaton. Both Cummins and Eaton found that the repairs would not be covered by their respective warranties. The Eaton inspection was conducted by Todd Sipos, Eaton's territorial sales and service manager. Sipos prepared a report dated October 1, 2001 (ex. 7) which, in relevant part, stated the following:

<block_quote>  The transmission was involved as well as the engine main thrust bearings for the crankshaft and the clutch . . . The engine had picked up a large amount of end play due to the lack of free play in the clutch. The thrust bearings were badly worn. The clutch was inspected next and found that it was a Meritor and the disks were discolored, also found that the wear pads on the release bearing had dimples indicating that the fork was in constant contact with the bearing, . . . Next I inspected the transmission, the inputshaft was broken in the spline area indicating a tortional (sic) type/shock type failure not covered under warranty. The inputshaft bearing was also failed due to the excessive end play that it experienced that bearing is a ball bearing and does not normally get the end play from the system. The transmission main case was also damaged due to the failure as was the gearing inside from secondary damage of the bearing failure. This failure was not coved (sic) under the warranty and is the customers to deal with.</block_quote>

The plaintiff received an estimate of $10,315.68 from Horwith as the cost of the repair of the truck. (Ex. 3.) The estimate did not state that the repairs were required because of any defect in the materials or workmanship of the transmission. The plaintiff did not have sufficient funds to pay for the repairs. Without the income from the operation of the truck the plaintiff was unable to make monthly payments to Newcourt.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
The truck remained with Horwith until 2003 when it was repossessed and sold by Newcourt. Subsequently Newcourt brought an action against the plaintiff seeking a deficiency judgment. That matter was settled in 2007 CT Page 20371 when the plaintiff and Newcourt agreed that a judgment in the amount of $86,250.82 could enter in favor of Newcourt against the plaintiff. Newcourt agreed to accept $25,000 in full settlement of the judgment, provided payment was made by May 1, 2008. The plaintiff was unable to pay Newcourt as promised and consequently owes Newcourt the entire balance of the judgment.

The basic Eaton warranty (ex. 10) includes the following relevant provisions:

Failures must be the result of verified and actual defects in material and/or workmanship and have occurred within the time and mileage limitations of the warranty coverage.

COVERAGE IS NOT PROVIDED FOR THE FOLLOWING FAILURES OR EXPENSES:

1. General Exclusions — A. Failures resulting from abuse, neglect, or accidents (i.e. Shockload or Spin out) . . . C. Failures due to excessive vibration from engine, clutch or drivelines. Failure due to improper driveline angles. D. Abnormal wear caused by driver such as clutch snubbing, fork wear, and twisted or broken shafts . . .

In support of her claim the plaintiff called Robert H. Bruneau as an expert witness. Bruneau is a truck mechanic with twenty-six years experience and is the owner of both a truck repair garage and an automobile repair garage. The court found Bruneau to be entirely credible. Bruneau testified that the damages to the Eaton transmission could not have been caused by lack of free play in the clutch as suggested in the report prepared by Todd Sipos on behalf of Eaton. Bruneau claimed that a clutch would fail before it could cause the type of damage described in the report. However, Bruneau was unable to determine the cause of the failure of the transmission. He included torsional shock caused by driver error in his list of possible causes.

The defendant's sole witness was Todd Sipos. Sipos testified that he has over twenty years experience with Eaton and has received extensive training regarding transmissions and their failure. He testified that he agreed with Bruneau that the misalignment of the clutch in the plaintiff's truck could not have caused the failure of the transmission. He pointed out that his report had summarized his conclusion that the failure was a torsional shock failure not covered by warranty. Sipos explained that a torsional shock can occur when the transmission is subject to high levels of torsion. Such levels can occur when a drive fails to disengage the clutch when the truck spins out or skids or engages in a rapid deceleration. He noted that the damage to the CT Page 20372 inputshaft was a break at a 45 degree angle which was consistent with inappropriately high levels of torsional stress. He testified that the actual failure of the transmission may have occurred some time after the incident which inflicted the high torsional stress on the transmission. The stress would cause the hard outer casing of the inputshaft to crack, exposing the softer inner part of the shaft to stress. Eventually this would lead the shaft to break and cause the remaining damage to the transmission. Sipos did not subject the inputshaft to any tests. He claimed that if the part had been defective, it would have failed long before reaching 250,000 miles of use. Sipos conceded that he did not include any reference to driver abuse or negligent in his October 1, 2001 report. However, he claimed that the reference to torsional shock failure in the report demonstrates that his assessment of the cause of the damage has remained consistent.

The plaintiff claims that the warranty issued by the defendant is an "adhesion contract" and that accordingly the defendant has the burden of proving that the damage to the transmission was caused by an exception to the coverage of the warranty. The plaintiff relies on <italic>Splicer-Young v.</italic><italic>American Fidelity Ins. Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>2 Conn.App. 282</cross_reference> (1995) which involved the question of whether the driver of an automobile was covered by the liability provisions of an insurance policy issued to the parents of driver. The car was owned by the driver's brother who resided in Massachusetts. The driver resided with his parents in Connecticut. The parents' policy provided liability coverage for "non-owned automobiles." That term was defined in the policy as "an automobile . . . not owned by or furnished for the regular use of either the named insured or any relative . . ." The defendant filed a special defense claiming that the automobile driven in the collision had been furnished by the driver's brother for his regular use. The trial court set aside a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, agreeing with the defendant insurance company, that the plaintiff had not presented evidence to show whether the automobile was, in fact, furnished to the driver for his regular use. The Appellate Court reversed the trial court and reinstated the verdict stating:

<block_quote>  [I]t has become the established law of this State that one instituting an action upon an insurance policy is only obliged to allege in his complaint, in general terms, that the various conditions precedent stated in the policy have been fulfilled; that it is then incumbent upon the defendant, by way of special defense, to set up such failures to comply with such conditions as it proposes to claim; that the burden CT Page 20373 rests upon the plaintiff to prove compliance with the conditions so put in issue, but that, as to other conditions precedent, compliance is presumed . . .</block_quote>

<italic>Id.</italic>, 285

The plaintiff claims that the provisions of General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-260</cross_reference>, governing extended warranties, render such warranties the legal equivalent of insurance policies. In particular, the plaintiff relies on the requirement that extended warranties covered by the statute, be filed with the Insurance Commissioner.

The court finds that plaintiff's arguments to be without merit. General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-260</cross_reference>(a)(1)(A) expressly excludes from the scope of the statute, extended warranties issued by manufacturers. The extended warranty issued to the plaintiff is such a warranty. Moreover, it is clear that the plaintiff's claim cannot be brought under the provisions of any extended warranty. Since the plaintiff's truck had only logged 262,001 miles at the time of the transmission failure, the transmission was still covered by the terms of the basic warranty which would not be within the scope of the statute under any circumstances.

Written warranties issued to a purchaser which are limited to defects in workmanship and materials and exclude product failures unconnected with imperfections in the product itself are not considered to be contracts of insurance. Am.Jur.2d, Insurance § 22. The court finds that the plaintiff has the burden of proving Eaton's breach of its warranty.

The terms of the basic warranty obligated the defendant to repair the transmission if failed due to defects in materials or workmanship. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the transmission failure was caused by such defects. The plaintiff offered no evidence from anyone who had inspected the transmission following its failure. The plaintiff can properly rely upon circumstantial evidence and logical inferences to prove her case. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not sustained her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure of her truck's transmission was the result of defects in workmanship or materials. Accordingly, the court finds the issues for the defendant, Eaton Corporation. Judgment may enter in accordance with this decision.

</unpublished></opinion_text><unpublished><footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the operative warranty was the extended warranty. The evidence showed that the coverage of the basic warranty and the extended warranty were identical. The parties agreed that the court could consider the allegations of the sixth count CT Page 20374 as amended to conform with the proof, insofar as the designation of the warranty was concerned.</footnote_body>
