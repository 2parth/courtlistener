</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The petitioner, Harlin Green, entered a guilty plea to two counts of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, a violation of General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-70</cross_reference>(a)(1) and received twenty (20) years incarceration concurrent with each other (two (2) years minimum), and two counts of Conspiracy to Commit Sexual Assault in the First Degree, a violation of General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-48</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>53a-70</cross_reference>(a)(1) and received seven (7) years incarceration (two (2) years minimum) concurrent with each other and consecutive to the two previous counts. The total effective sentence is twenty-seven (27) years incarceration. It is from this sentence the petitioner seeks review.

On May 22, 2002 Hartford Police were dispatched to Meadow Street on the report of a sexual assault. The female victim stated that she was walking down Wethersfield Avenue when a car approached her and the driver asked her for a cigarette. A male passenger then grabbed her and put a gun to her neck and forced her into the car. The male passenger and driver asked her to comply but she refused and they handcuffed her and undressed her and sexually assaulted her then tossed her out of the car. She was taken to the hospital.

On June 3, 2002 a police officer came upon Gregory Johnson in the midst of a sexual assault. Green was also involved and he admitted that the pair had sexually assaulted a black female a month earlier. The victim stated that she was forced to have sex with Green, and that he acted as a lookout when Johnson assaulted her.

Counsel for the petitioner agrees there is no excuse for what happened. However, he argues that the petitioner has a lower intellect than the co-defendant. Counsel agrees he was participating, but was not the prime mover. Counsel addresses his client's prior criminal history which reflects he is not this type of person. Counsel believes his client's sentence should be reduced because of the disparity in the two participants' levels of intelligence. CT Page 17766

Counsel for the state counters these remarks by pointing out the particular brutal nature of these crimes. The victims were raped at gunpoint by two individuals at the same time. These were not isolated incidents which argues against the petitioner's lack of intellect. It seems clear the two defendants acted together.

Pursuant to Connecticut Practice Book § <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq., the Sentence Review Division is limited in the scope of its review. The Division is to determine whether the sentence imposed "should be modified because it is inappropriate or disproportionate in light of the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, the protection of the public interest and the deterrent, rehabilitative, isolative and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended."

The Division is without authority to modify a sentence except in accordance with the provisions of the Connecticut Practice Book § <cross_reference>43-28</cross_reference>
et seq., and Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>51-194</cross_reference> et seq.

The facts as put forth seem more like violent serial rapists caught in the act of their violence. This was not an isolated event which argues against the petitioner being a less willing actor. The sentencing court agreed and indicated on its remarks that regardless of the defendant's intellect, anyone would know this was wrong.

There is no question these were serious violent crimes which will in all likelihood have long lasting psychological effects on the victims. In reviewing the record as a whole, the Division finds that the sentencing Court's actions were in accordance with the parameters of Connecticut Practice Book § <cross_reference>43-23</cross_reference> et seq.

The sentence imposed was neither inappropriate or disproportionate.

The sentence is <italic>AFFIRMED.</italic>
