</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   There is no evidence before this Court that the provisions of <bold>Section 1164 of the General Statutes</bold><page_number>Page 388</page_number>
have been complied with. This section required this appellant, as one claiming exemption from taxation, to file a report during the time prescribed by law for the filing of assessment lists next succeeding the acquiring of property not theretofore made exempt by the provisions of <bold>Section 1163.</bold>

</opinion_text>   This reason alone requires the dismissal of the appeal, which is hereby ordered.
