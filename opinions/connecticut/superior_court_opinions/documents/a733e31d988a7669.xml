<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiffs seek damages for alleged violations of their civil rights under the federal and state constitutions, assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress from six New Britain police officers, the chief of police and the city, itself. The alleged conduct giving rise to the lawsuit occurred during the execution of a search warrant at the residence of the plaintiffs in New Britain on June 10, 2004.

The defendants have moved for summary judgment on certain of the claims made by the plaintiffs. Their motion is supported by affidavits as to the events surrounding execution of the warrant, as is the opposition of the plaintiffs, and these affidavits reveal that there are many classic jury questions to be resolved. Nevertheless, the defendants argue that there are certain counts of the complaint on which summary judgment should be granted, at least in part.

For example, the defendants cite federal law to the effect that detaining and even handcuffing occupants of a premises while a search is being conducted are not violations of their constitutional rights. See<italic>Michigan v. Summers</italic>, <cross_reference>452 U.S. 692</cross_reference> (1981); <italic>Muehler v. Mena</italic>, <cross_reference>544 U.S. 93</cross_reference>
(2005). The plaintiffs do not quarrel with this law. They point out, however, that much more than detaining and handcuffing the plaintiffs is alleged in their complaint, which claims that extreme force amounting to assault and battery was used by the defendant officers in their execution of the warrant. They cite numerous federal cases to the effect that the whole course of police conduct in executing a warrant is subject to review when a civil rights violation is alleged. See, e.g., <italic>Tarpley v.</italic><italic>Greene</italic>, <cross_reference>684 F.2d 1</cross_reference> (D.C. Cir. 1982). At oral argument on the motion counsel for the defendants acknowledged that certain of the conduct alleged in the complaint would go forward to trial, and that her intent was to obtain partial summary judgment on the particular allegations of detention and handcuffing.

"Although there is some conflict among the Superior Court judges on this issue, the majority rule . . . is that Connecticut procedure does not allow entry of summary judgment on one part or allegation of a cause of action when the ruling will not dispose of an entire claim, and therefore, will not allow entry of judgment on that claim." <italic>Bridgeport</italic><italic>Harbor Place I v. Ganim</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Complex Litigation Docket No. X06 CV 04 0184523, 2007 Ct.Super. 16838, 16841 (Oct. 5, 2007). Even courts which have held that summary judgment may enter on part of a claim within a single count have demanded that "final judgment can be entered with respect to that part of the claim and it can be severed from the remainder of the claim." See, e.g., <italic>Pelletier</italic><italic>v. Sordoni/Skanska Construction Co.</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Complex Litigation Docket No. X06 CV 95 0155184, 2005 Ct.Super. 8032, 8035 [39 Conn. L. Rptr.] (May 5, 2005).

This court cannot enter judgment on any of the counts in the complaint even if it agrees with the defendants on their claims of law as to detention and handcuffing. And, it sees no way to sever those allegations from the others in the complaint any more than, in a case arising out of a motor vehicle collision, it could sever one of several allegations of negligence and enter summary judgment on that allegation, leaving others still to be litigated.

The purpose of summary judgment is to obviate the time and cost of litigation when the facts are undisputed and the law is clear. Granting summary judgment on one of several allegations supporting a cause of action does not serve that end because the cause of action remains to be litigated. That does not mean the defendants are without a vehicle to preclude litigation of issues as to which the law is clear. Prior to trial they may file a motion in limine or a motion to preclude evidence and argument as to those issues and secure a ruling from the court at that time.

Counts two and nine seek recovery from the city of New Britain because, it is alleged, the violations of the plaintiffs' rights were caused by "policies and customs" of the city exhibiting "deliberate indifference" to the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The city seeks summary judgment on these counts, claiming an absence of evidence that the plaintiffs' alleged injuries were caused by policies or customs of the city.

The complaint alleges, however, the <italic>absence</italic> of policies adopted by the city or the police department covering how police officers should CT Page 1536 conduct themselves in executing a search warrant and the <italic>absence</italic> of training for supervisors as to how to control the conduct of officers subject to their oversight, both generally and in the execution of search warrants. The U.S. Supreme Court has explicitly held that the <italic>absence</italic> of training "may fairly be said to represent a policy for which the city is responsible, and for which the city may be held liable if it actually causes injury." <italic>City of Canton v. Harris</italic>, <cross_reference>489 U.S. 378</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>390</cross_reference> (1989). At the summary judgment stage the burden is on the defendants to show that there is no question as to the material fact whether such policies and training existed, and the city has failed to meet that burden.

Similarly, the defendant police chief seeks summary judgment on the counts directed to him because he was not present during the execution of the search warrant. There are, however, numerous bases on which a supervisor may be held liable for the conduct of his subordinates in violating constitutional rights even when he did not participate personally in the violation. See, e.g., <italic>Colon v. Coughlin</italic>, <cross_reference>58 F.3d 865</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>873</cross_reference>
(2d Cir. 1999). In this complaint the chief is alleged to be liable because, like the city, he had failed to put in place policies concerning the execution of warrants and the training of supervisors and other officers, and the absence of those policies led to the violation of the plaintiffs' rights. This claim, if proven, could bring the chief within the ambit of cases like <italic>Colon</italic>, <italic>supra</italic>.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> At this stage of the proceedings the burden is on the chief, as the party moving for summary judgment, to demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to the material fact of the existence of policies and training which the complaint claims are absent and which caused the plaintiffs' injuries, and he has offered nothing to do so. "On a motion by the defendant for summary judgment the burden is on the defendant to negate each claim as framed by the complaint . . . [I]t is only once the defendant's burden . . . is met that the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists justifying a trial. Accordingly, [w]hen documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue."

Finally, the defendants seek summary judgment on false arrest and malicious prosecution claims of the plaintiff Rosa E. Baez. A review of the complaint reveals no such claims; so, this issue is moot.

For all the reasons previously stated, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED. CT Page 1537

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> At oral argument the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on these policy-related claims against the city and the chief without expert testimony, and no expert has been disclosed by the plaintiffs. This claim was not briefed by the defendants, however, and, therefore, will not be considered by the court.</footnote_body>
