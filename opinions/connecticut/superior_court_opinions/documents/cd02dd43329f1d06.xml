<block_quote>  3.  Both parties shall inform the other, reasonably in advance, of the child's major social and educational activities and appointments, so that both parties may participate where possible and appropriate, and each shall further advise the other of the child's emergency situations, illnesses and life problems which may occur when the child is with him or her.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  4.  Both the husband and the wife shall have the right to attend school and public events in which the child participates which are related to the child, such as games and practices, school programs, parent/teacher conferences, church events, recitals, etc., and neither shall do anything to interfere with said right.

<block_quote>  5.  If the Plaintiff shall desire to remove the minor child to a permanent residence outside of Stamford, CT, he shall notify the wife of such intention and shall advise her of the new location of the intended home.

<block_quote>  9.  Both parties shall exert every reasonable effort to maintain free access, including telephone access, unhampered contact between the minor child and each of the parents, and to foster a feeling of affection between the minor child in both parents.

In 2000, and subsequent even-numbered years, the husband will have the child for the same "Thanksgiving vacation" and the wife on Christmas Eve commencing 8:30 PM though Christmas Day at 8 PM.

<block_quote>  13. Neither party shall discuss the court's decision in this matter with the child other than to tell him what the court has ordered. Neither parent shall discuss any other matter relating to the legal aspects of this case with the child.</block_quote>
