<opinion_text><unpublished>  The purpose of a motion to strike is to contest the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint and to challenge whether they state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <italic>Peter-Michael, Inc. v. Sea Shell</italic><italic>Associates</italic>, <cross_reference>244 Conn. 269</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>270</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>709 A.2d 558</cross_reference> (1998). In this matter, the defendant Darlene Meeks moves to strike the count of the plaintiff's complaint that alleges recklessness, on the grounds that the claim is insufficiently pleaded. The plaintiff Helayne Slodzinski opposes the motion.

In Count Two of her complaint the plaintiff alleges that she was driving east on Hawthorne Street in Manchester and that the defendant was driving west. At the intersection with Laurel Street the defendant attempted to make a left turn and a collision between the two vehicles occurred, injuring the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant "operated said vehicle with deliberate and/or reckless disregard," substantially causing the plaintiff's damages because the defendant violated Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>14-218a</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>14-222</cross_reference>. The two statutes, read together, prohibit the operation of a car "at such a rate of speed as to endanger the life of any person . . ." Further, the plaintiff claims entitlement to double or treble damages under Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>14-295</cross_reference> which permits such a claim if the plaintiff can prove a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. ยง <cross_reference>14-218a</cross_reference> or <cross_reference>14-222</cross_reference>.

The defendant claims that the plaintiff has not pleaded anything in Count Two other than ordinary negligence, as indeed the plaintiff has done expressly in Count One. The defendant argues that the only substantive difference in Count Two is the addition of the word "reckless," and that this is legally insufficient. But in determining the legal sufficiency of Count Two, the question is not how similar it CT Page 7632 is to Count One. Rather the question is whether Count Two can stand on its own as sounding in recklessness. Reading the allegations in Count Two in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, <italic>Faulkner v. United</italic><italic>Technologies Corp.</italic>, <cross_reference>240 Conn. 576</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>580</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>693 A.2d 293</cross_reference> (1997), Count Two can so stand. The essential allegation in Count Two is that the speed of the defendant in making the left turn was <italic>so</italic> fast as to be life-threatening. This may or may not turn out to be provable. But, as pleaded, the recklessness count is legally sufficient, as is the accompanying claim for double or treble damages.

Accordingly the Motion to Strike is denied.
