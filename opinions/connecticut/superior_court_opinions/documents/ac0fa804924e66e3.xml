<opinion_text><unpublished>  The parties' marriage was dissolved on December 5, 2007. The judgment provided, in part, that the defendant pay child support to the plaintiff in the amount of $181.00 per week. The plaintiff filed the instant contempt motion based on arrearage due as of December 4, 2008. The parties made oral arguments and have submitted briefs on the issues.

At the time of the dissolution of the parties' marriage, they had a joint account at Wachovia Bank. The subject account has been used to pay the bills of both of the parties, and has included deposits by the defendant, with the plaintiff's approval, for the child support payment due under the terms of the judgment.

The defendant initially claimed that he had overpaid his child support to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,295.04. The plaintiff disputed this alleged overpayment, and the defendant then reduced his overpayment claim to $488.91. The plaintiff again disputed the amount, claiming that the defendant neglected to include in his calculations sums paid out of the joint account for his bills, including amounts for his 2007 vehicle taxes, room and board. The defendant then claimed that the room and board payments, which were made to his landlord, his former mother-in-law, should not have been paid.

Further, the plaintiff claims in her instant contempt motion that the defendant is also three weeks delinquent for the period from December 5, 2008 through February 27, 2009, in the total sum of $543.00.

The defendant, in his contempt motion dated December 15, 2008, alleges that the plaintiff failed to transfer her interest in the ownership of a certain 2003 Cadillac, which was held in joint ownership, pursuant to the terms of the dissolution decree and judgment, thereby forcing the defendant to make city tax payments of the vehicle in the amount of $574.96. The parties made oral arguments and have submitted briefs on CT Page 6021 the issues.

The undersigned, having heard the arguments of counsel and reviewed the parties' briefs, and written evidentiary submissions does hereby find as follows:

The plaintiff's motion for contempt, dated December 4, 2008, is hereby granted. The undersigned finds non-compliance with a valid court order of child support payment as detailed above. The court finds the contempt to be willful. The court finds a total arrearage due to the plaintiff in the amount of $2,816.59. The undersigned also awards the plaintiff attorneys fees in the amount of $1,000, for a total amount due of $3,816.59. The defendant is ordered to pay the amount due to the plaintiff by June 1, 2009.

The defendant's motion for contempt, dated December 15, 2008 is hereby granted. The undersigned finds non-compliance with a valid court order to transfer the plaintiff's interest in the 2003 Cadillac. The court finds the contempt to be willful. The court finds that the defendant is due the sum of $574.96, which sum may be deducted from the total amount due from the defendant to the plaintiff as indicated above. The court also orders that the plaintiff transfer her interest in the 2003 Cadillac to the defendant by April 24, 2009.
