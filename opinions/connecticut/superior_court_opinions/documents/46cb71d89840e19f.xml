The function of a motion to strike is to test the legal sufficiency of a pleading. Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>10-39</cross_reference>; <italic>Ferryman v. Groton</italic>, <cross_reference>212 Conn. 138</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>142</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>561 A.2d 432</cross_reference> (1989); <italic>Mingachos v. CBS, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>196 Conn. 91</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>108</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>491 A.2d 368</cross_reference> (1985). In deciding a motion to strike the trial court must consider as true the factual allegations, but not the legal conclusions set forth in the complaint. <italic>Liljedahl Bros., Inc. v. Grigsby</italic>,<cross_reference>215 Conn. 345</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>348</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>576 A.2d 149</cross_reference> (1990); <italic>Blancato v. Feldspar Corp.</italic>, <cross_reference>203 Conn. 34</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>36</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>522 A.2d 1235</cross_reference> (1987). The court should view the facts in a broad fashion, not strictly limited to the allegations, but also including the facts necessarily implied by and fairly provable under them.<italic>Dennison v. Klotz</italic>, <cross_reference>12 Conn.App. 570</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>577</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>532 A.2d 1311</cross_reference> (1987), cert. denied, <cross_reference>206 Conn. 803</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>535 A.2d 1317</cross_reference> (1988). In ruling on a motion to strike, the court must take as admitted all well-pled facts, and those CT Page 17770 necessarily implied thereby, and construe them in the manner most favorable to the pleader. <italic>Norwich v. Silverberg</italic>, <cross_reference>200 Conn. 367</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>370</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>511 A.2d 336</cross_reference> (1986).

A motion to strike is an appropriate means of presenting to the court legal issues at the onset of litigation. <italic>Gordon v. Bridgeport Housing</italic><italic>Authority</italic>, <cross_reference>208 Conn. 161</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>170</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>544 A.2d 1185</cross_reference> (1988).

<italic>AS TO COUNT ONE-</italic>Magnuson-Moss Federal Trade Commission Act: "If a consumer finally prevails in any action brought under . . . this subsection, he may be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of cost and expenses (including attorneys fees based on actual time expended) determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the plaintiff for or in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action, unless the court in its discretion shall determine that such an award of attorneys fees would be inappropriate." <italic>Chrysler Corporation v.</italic><italic>Maiocco</italic>, <cross_reference>209 Conn. 579</cross_reference> (1989) <cross_reference>552 A.2d 1207</cross_reference>, and<cross_reference>15 U.S.C.S. Section 2310</cross_reference>(d)(2) (2007). Therefore, the Motion to Strike is denied as to Count One.

<italic>AS TO COUNT TWO</italic>-Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code: The plaintiff seeks relief under the CUCC. The Defendant claims that the plaintiff has never revoked acceptance. This is a question of fact for the trier of fact to decide therefore, the Motion to Strike as to Count Two is denied.

<italic>AS TO COUNT THREE-</italic>Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act:

Under Connecticut General Statues Section 42-100g(d) "In any action brought by a person under this section, the court may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery . . ." The plaintiff would be entitled to recover the items claimed in their prayer for relief Therefore, the therefore, the Motion to Strike as to Court Three is denied.
