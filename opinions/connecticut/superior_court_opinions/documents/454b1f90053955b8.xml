</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  This matter was tried to the court May 8-9, 2007, with post-trial briefs submitted to the court thereafter. After considering the evidence and arguments of the parties, the court issues this memorandum of decision.

As the trier of fact, the court must resolve issues of credibility. See <italic>State v. Nowell</italic>, <cross_reference>262 Conn. 686</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>695</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>817</cross_reference> A.2d 76(2003); <italic>Lacic v.</italic><italic>Thomas</italic>, <cross_reference>78 Conn.App. 406</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>409-10</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829 A.2d 1</cross_reference>, cert. denied,<cross_reference>266 Conn. 922</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>835 A.2d 472</cross_reference> (2003).

The court finds the following facts and credits the following evidence.

The plaintiff, Federal Hill Builders, LLC, is a general construction contractor. The defendant, Hossein Tehrani, trustee of the Hossein Tehrani revocable trust, is the owner of a certain piece or parcel of land, with the buildings thereon, located in Goshen, CT. On February 12, 2005, the parties entered into a written contract for the construction of a single-family house on the defendant's land in Goshen, CT. It is apparent that the parties, both in the making of the contract as well as their initial dealings with each other, made every attempt to work together and accommodate each other while addressing the various issues that arose in the early stages of construction of the defendant's house. Unfortunately, however, perhaps due to differing expectations or certain breakdowns in communication, the parties ultimately did not see eye-to-eye on how the plaintiff was going about the construction of the house. As a result, the plaintiff was fired by the defendant, and this CT Page 14459 litigation ensued.

On July 27, 2005, the plaintiff filed a mechanics lien in the amount of $83,805.26. There was a hearing on this matter on October 13, 2005, at which time the court, Pickard, J., ordered the lien reduced to $73,805.26. On December 6, 2005, the plaintiff sought to foreclose on the mechanics lien.

On July 24, 2006, the defendant filed an answer and special defenses as well as two counterclaims. The matter was ultimately tried to the court and at the conclusion of the trial the parties submitted their final adjusted claims to the court. The plaintiff submitted an adjusted claim seeking $65,478.24 and the defendant submitted a counterclaim for $14,167.99.

This case centers around certain disputes of fact as to what amount the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the work performed on the defendant's land prior to being fired. To the extent that the plaintiff performed workmanlike work, there should be some recovery. The plaintiff is not, however, entitled to recover for the work that was not done in a workmanlike manner nor work that needed to be corrected, rather than just completed. There were several exhibits submitted by the defendant indicating either the approximate value of certain work done by the plaintiff or amounts that the defendant had to spend to "fix" certain aspects of the job. Not all of these expenditures, however, were to "fix" faulty work, but rather, some were done to complete work that the plaintiff had started. These items, had the plaintiff been permitted to finish the job, would have had to be done by the plaintiff at his own cost. The fact that the plaintiff did not get a chance to finish these items because the defendant fired him does not mean he should have to bear the burden of paying for them. Additionally, some items, such as the driveway, may have experienced deterioration in the time between when the plaintiff was fired and when the defendant found someone else to finish the job. Erosion or other variables may have contributed to the "fixes" that the defendant claims were needed when the job was resumed. The plaintiff, again, should not have to bear this burden. Taking all of these things into account, the court, in its discretion, awards the plaintiff the following amounts:<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

$3,734.91 for driveway material

$5,280.00 for concrete labor

$4,751.00 for concrete material

CT Page 14460

$11,000.00 for excavation of the driveway and site work

$2,256.63 for equipment rental (lull)

$10,500.00 for labor-framing

$291.30 for copying blueprints

$2,174.00 for permit fees

$4,000.00 for general contractor fee

Totaling: $43,987.84

Additionally, during trial, the defendant represented that there were certain expenses originally claimed by the plaintiff that the defendant had either already paid or had made arrangements to pay and, therefore, the plaintiff would incur no additional costs. The plaintiff agreed that these items would not be part of his adjusted claims, provided the defendant agreed to indemnify the plaintiff should any claims arise from these items. Specifically, the defendant agreed to indemnify the plaintiff for any claims relating to: (1) the $3,500.00 to Sherman Palmer for tree and brush cutting; and (2) the $790.00 to Ronald McCarthy for surveying. Additionally, the defendant represented on the record that he has paid Mountain Top Trucking $5,271.93 for driveway material. The plaintiff's adjusted claim for driveway material from Mountain Top Trucking was $5,594.86 (on which the court awarded the plaintiff $3,734.91). The defendant agreed on the record to indemnify the plaintiff should Mountain Top Trucking make any claim against the plaintiff for any portion of the $5,271.93 which the defendant represented he has paid.

As to the defendants' counterclaims, the court awards the following:

$2,835.00 for repairs to the lower level and garage

$1,562.99 for structural changes to the foundation

Totaling: $4,397.99

In addition to his claim, the plaintiff has moved for attorneys fees in the amount of $11,871.95. "Connecticut case law follows the general rule, frequently referred to as the American Rule, that attorneys fees are not allowed to the prevailing party as an element of damages unless such recovery is allowed by statute or contract." (Internal quotation CT Page 14461 marks omitted.) <italic>Florian v. Lenge</italic>, <cross_reference>91 Conn.App. 268</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>283</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>880 A.2d 985</cross_reference>
(2005). The plaintiff seeks attorneys fees pursuant to General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>52-249</cross_reference>(a).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Section <cross_reference>52-249</cross_reference>(a) was discussed in <italic>A  A Mason, LLC v.</italic><italic>Montagno Construction, Inc.</italic>, Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 01 0809850 (May 10, 2005, Satter, J.T.R.) (49 Conn.Sup. 405). In <italic>Montagno</italic>, the court examined the legislative history of ยง <cross_reference>52-249</cross_reference>(a) and found that it "sheds no light on the meaning of the phrase `hearing as to the form of judgment or the limitation of the time for redemption.' " <italic>Id.</italic>, 410. Thus, in looking at the words of the statute and foreclosures in general, the court found that ยง <cross_reference>52-249</cross_reference>(a) permits attorneys fees when there is a hearing on a foreclosure action as to the form of judgment only as it relates to either a strict foreclosure or foreclosure by sale. <italic>Id.</italic>, 411. <italic>Montagno</italic> found, and this court agrees, that "[t]here is no provision in [ยง <cross_reference>52-249</cross_reference>(a)] that attorneys fees are to be allowed for the trial of the underlying action." <italic>Id.</italic> As such, the plaintiff's claim for attorneys fees is denied.

<center>                               <italic>Conclusion</italic></center>
For the foregoing reasons, and based on the foregoing calculations, the court finds as follows: the plaintiff is entitled to damages in the amount of $43,987.84, offset by the amount that the defendant is entitled to under his counterclaim of $4,397.99. Therefore, the defendant is awarded $39,589.85. Each party is to pay their own attorneys fees.

So Ordered.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> These amounts are only broken apart to make it easier for the parties to see how much, if any, was awarded under each claim from the plaintiff and, as such, are itemized in the same order and manner as the parties presented the claims in their adjusted post-trial briefs.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Section <cross_reference>52-249</cross_reference>(a) provides in relevant part that: "(a) The plaintiff in any action of foreclosure of a mortgage or lien, upon obtaining judgment of foreclosure, when there has been a hearing as to the form of judgment or the limitation of time for redemption, shall be allowed the same costs, including a reasonable attorneys fee, as if there had been a hearing on an issue of fact. The same costs and fees shall be recoverable as part of the judgment in any action upon a bond which has been substituted for a mechanic's lien."</footnote_body>
