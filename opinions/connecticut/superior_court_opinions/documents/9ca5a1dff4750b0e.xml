<opinion_text><unpublished>  Before the court is the motion to strike filed by the defendant, Connecticut Light  Power Company, on September 29, 2003.

As a preliminary matter, on October 14, 2003, the plaintiff, Timber Trails Associates, filed a request for leave to file an amended complaint pursuant to Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-60</cross_reference>, to which the defendant did not object. The court recognizes that the plaintiff filed its request for leave to amend after the defendant filed its motion to strike. Having not filed an objection to the plaintiff's request for leave to amend its complaint, the defendant has consented to the amendment. Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-60</cross_reference>. Moreover, because the defendant has "[failed] to plead further" in response to the amended complaint, the court will apply the defendant's motion to strike "so far as possible" to the plaintiff's amended complaint. Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-61</cross_reference>.

The plaintiff filed a six-count amended complaint against the defendant seeking damages resulting from the defendant's alleged trespass upon the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff asserts claims for trespass (count one); injunctive relief (count two); negligent destruction of trees and erection of poles and utility lines (count three); slander of title (count four); a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-110a</cross_reference> et seq. (count five); and unjust enrichment (count six).

The plaintiff alleges the following in its amended complaint. The plaintiff, a Connecticut partnership, is the owner of real property located in Sherman and New Fairfield, Connecticut.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The defendant has two express easements granting it certain rights with regard to the plaintiff's property. The defendant entered upon a portion of the plaintiff's CT Page 3524 property, which is not within the areas described in either of the defendant's easements, and clear-cut a strip of the plaintiff's property, destroying and carrying away trees, timber and shrubbery. The defendant then erected utility poles and lines for electrical services upon that portion of the plaintiff's property. Thereafter, the plaintiff contacted the defendant and advised the defendant that it was trespassing upon the plaintiff's property "without any right or authority to do so, and without the consent of [the plaintiff]." (Amended Complaint, Count 4, ¶ 10.) In response, the defendant informed the plaintiff that it had the right to enter upon that portion of the property and cut down, destroy and remove trees, timber and shrubbery and that it had a right to erect and maintain poles and utility lines thereon. The plaintiff sent a letter dated July 10, 2002 to the defendant's claims department informing the defendant that neither easement "granted [the defendant] any such rights on [the plaintiff's] land." (Amended Complaint, Count 4, ¶ 12.) The defendant continues to maintain poles and utility lines on the plaintiff's property without its consent.

On September 29, 2003, the defendant filed a motion to strike counts three (violation of General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-560</cross_reference>), five (slander of title) and six (violation of CUTPA) of the original complaint and a memorandum of law in support thereof. On October 14, 2003, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant's motion to strike. The court notes that in its amended complaint, the plaintiff has withdrawn the count seeking damages pursuant to § <cross_reference>52-560</cross_reference> (count three in the original complaint). The court will therefore apply the motion to strike "so far as possible"; Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-61</cross_reference>; to the slander of title claim and the claim alleging a violation of CUTPA, now counts four and five of the amended complaint.

<center>                      <italic>Count Four (Slander of Title)</italic></center>
Count four incorporates paragraphs one through thirteen of count one and further alleges that the statement made by the defendant — that it had the right to enter upon the plaintiff's property, cut down, destroy and remove trees and erect and maintain utility poles thereon — "impugned [the plaintiff's] title to . . . its property . . . and was naturally to be interpreted as disparaging and casting doubt upon [the plaintiff's] title to that property and was so understood." (Amended Complaint, Count 4, ¶ 14.) The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant's statement was false and the defendant "knew the statement was false, or demonstrated a reckless disregard for its truth." (Amended Complaint, Count 4, ¶ 15.) The plaintiff further alleges that the defendant's statement was communicated to a third party and that the statement brings the plaintiff's "title to its land into question and thereby impairs the marketability and possibility for development" of the plaintiff's property. (Amended Complaint, Count 4, ¶ 17.)

The defendant moves to strike count four on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to allege the requisite elements for a slander of title claim. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not pleaded that the statement, which gives rise to the slander of title claim, was in writing. The defendant also argues that "the facts as alleged do not allow for an inference of malice in [the defendant) stating that it had the right to perform the acts that it is alleged to have committed." (Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion to Strike, p. 6.) In opposition, the plaintiff argues that in a slander of title cause of action the statement may be either written or oral. The plaintiff also argues that it has sufficiently alleged malice on the part of the defendant.

"A cause of action for slander of title consists of the uttering or publication of a false statement derogatory to the plaintiff's title, with malice, causing special damages as a result of diminished value of the plaintiff's property in the eyes of third parties. The publication must be false, and the CT Page 3526 plaintiff must have an estate or interest in the property slandered. Pecuniary damages must be shown in order to prevail on such a claim." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Elm Street</italic><italic>Builders, Inc. v. Enterprise Park Condominium Assn., Inc.,</italic><cross_reference>63 Conn. App. 657</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>669-70</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>778 A.2d 237</cross_reference> (2001). The defendant's claim that the plaintiff must plead that the alleged false communication was written, and not oral, is without merit. "In the law of defamation, `slander' connotes oral and `libel' written communication but . . . `slander of title' [is] used without regard to the manner of publication." <italic>QSP, Inc. v. Aetna</italic><italic>Casualty  Surety Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>256 Conn. 343</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>359</cross_reference> n. 15, <cross_reference>773 A.2d 906</cross_reference>
(2001).

The defendant also moves to strike the slander of title claim arguing that "the facts as alleged do not allow for an inference of malice on [the defendant's] part." (Defendant's Memorandum, p. 1.) To satisfy the element of malice, the plaintiff must allege that the defendant made the statement "`with knowledge that [it was] false or with a reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the facts stated' . . ." <italic>Chase Manhattan Bank Mortgage Corp.</italic><italic>v. Saraceni,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Danbury, Docket No. CV 99 0335972 (March 8, 2000, Moraghan, J.) (<cross_reference>26 Conn. L. Rptr. 577</cross_reference>, 579), quoting <italic>Moriarty v. Lippe,</italic> <cross_reference>162 Conn. 371</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>387</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>294 A.2d 326</cross_reference> (1972).

A review of count four reveals that the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that the statement made by the defendant was made with malice. As noted above, the plaintiff alleges that the statement made by the defendant "was false, and [the defendant] knew the statement was false, or demonstrated a reckless disregard for its truth." (Amended Complaint, Count 4, ¶ 15.) "[I]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Bhinder v. Sun Co., supra,</italic> <cross_reference>263 Conn. 366</cross_reference>. The defendant's motion to strike count four of the amended complaint is therefore denied.

<center>                           <italic>COUNT FIVE (CUTPA)</italic></center>
Count five incorporates paragraphs one through thirteen of count one and further alleges that the plaintiff is in the business of owning, managing and developing real property and the defendant is in the business of distributing and selling electricity. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant's conduct, i.e., trespassing upon the plaintiff's property, cutting CT Page 3527 trees, timber and shrubs and erecting poles and utility lines, constitutes a violation of CUTPA because these actions are "immoral, oppressive, unscrupulous and have caused substantial injury to [the plaintiff]." (Amended Complaint, Count 5, ¶ 16.) The plaintiff further alleges that the defendant's conduct "impaired the value and marketability of its land . . ." (Amended Complaint, Count 5, ¶ 18.) The defendant moves to strike count five on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts to support a violation of CUTPA. The defendant argues that count five is legally insufficient because the plaintiff is not within the class of consumers, competitors, or other business persons whose interests CUTPA was enacted to protect. The defendant also contends that count five does not satisfy the cigarette rule because the plaintiff fails to allege facts to support its allegation that the defendant's conduct was immoral, oppressive or unscrupulous.

The plaintiff argues in opposition that it has sufficiently pleaded a CUTPA violation because it has alleged that "[a]s a business entity [it] has . . . been harmed by the [d]efendant's tortious conduct . . . [and] [t]he [d]efendant's wrongdoing interferes with fair and open competition in the marketplace . . ." (Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Defendant's Motion to Strike, p. 13.) The plaintiff also argues that the defendant's conduct was "immoral, oppressive and unscrupulous to an extent necessary to satisfy CUTPA . . ." (Plaintiff's Memorandum, p. 15.)

General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-110b</cross_reference>(a) provides: "No person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce." "`Trade' and `commerce' means the advertising, the sale or rent or lease, the offering for sale or rent or lease, or the distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value in this state." General Statutes § <cross_reference>42-110a</cross_reference>(4).

"CUTPA is remedial in character . . . and must be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Fitzpatrick v.</italic><italic>Scalzi,</italic> <cross_reference>72 Conn. App. 779</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>785</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>806 A.2d 593</cross_reference> (2002). Although "CUTPA imposes no requirement of a consumer relationship";<italic>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. v. Larsen,</italic> <cross_reference>232 Conn. 480</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>496</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>656 A.2d 1009</cross_reference> (1995); "it strains credulity to conclude that CUTPA is so formless as to provide redress to any person, for any CT Page 3528 ascertainable harm, caused by any person in the conduct of any `trade' or `commerce.'" <italic>Jackson v. R.G. Whipple, Inc.,</italic><cross_reference>225 Conn. 705</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>725-26</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>627 A.2d 374</cross_reference> (1993).

"[CUTPA] . . . gives protection to wronged competitors and consumers but not to the world at large or any individual who might be injured by the activities of a business entity no matter what relationship the individual had with that business, even no relationship at all." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Mather</italic><italic>v. Birken Manufacturing Co.,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 96 0564862 (December 8, 1998, Hennessey, J.) (<cross_reference>23 Conn. L. Rptr. 443</cross_reference>, 449). "To ensure fair competition, CUTPA gives protection to business persons `who have that type of a commercial relationship to the alleged wrongdoer which is such that the latter's unfair and deceptive acts might deleteriously affect fair competition in a particular marketplace.' . . . Moreover, `[t]he act [was not] meant to protect any individual or business who happened to be harmed no matter what the context or relationship between the wrongdoer and the claimant.'" (Citation omitted.) <italic>Id.,</italic> quoting <italic>Connecticut</italic><italic>Water Co. v. Thomaston,</italic> Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV 94 0535590 (November 6, 1996, Corradino, J.).

In <italic>Connecticut Water Co. v. Thomaston, supra,</italic> Superior Court, Docket No. CV 94 0535590, the plaintiff brought suit seeking damages for the contamination of its well field, which was located below property owned by the defendant town. The plaintiff alleged that the property was used by the town as a maintenance garage and that there were gasoline tanks below the surface that leaked. <italic>Id.</italic> The gasoline tanks were allegedly installed, maintained, owned and filled by the defendant Standard Cycle and Auto Company (SCASCO). <italic>Id.</italic> SCASCO moved to strike the CUTPA claim brought against it on the ground that it failed to allege "the necessary business and/or consumer relationship between the plaintiff . . . and SCASCO." <italic>Id.</italic> The plaintiff argued in opposition that <italic>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. v. Larsen, supra,</italic><cross_reference>232 Conn. 496</cross_reference>, recognized "three categories of plaintiff [that] have standing to bring a claim under CUTPA: (1) consumers; (2) competitors; and (3) other business persons affected by the unfair or deceptive act" and that "its complaint alleges it is a business person affected by SCASCO's `unfair conduct.'"<italic>Connecticut Water Co. v. Thomaston, supra,</italic> Superior Court, Docket No. CV 94 0535590. CT Page 3529

In granting SCASCO's motion to strike the CUTPA claim, the court, Corradino, J., noted: "[T]he use of this `other business person' language was not intended to expand the operation of . . . CUTPA beyond the original [purpose] of [the act] — the preservation of fair competitive markets and the direct protection of consumers which was the whole aim of the legislative endeavor in the first place. Thus, when <italic>Larsen</italic> said CUTPA did not depend on a consumer relationship but was also designed to protect competitors and other business people it meant that protecting those underlined entities was necessary to ensure fair competition. The latter goal requires giving protection to direct competitors but also at times to business people who have that type of a commercial relationship to the alleged wrongdoer which is such that the [latter is] unfair."<italic>Id.</italic> "The broader class sought to be protected against unfair trade practices beyond consumers are competitors or other business people harmed in the competitive market place who thereby lose business that should have otherwise been theirs as a result of their hard work and fair dealing. The act [was not] meant to protect any individual or business who happened to be harmed no matter what the context or relationship between the wrongdoer and the claimant." <italic>Id.</italic>

In the present case, the plaintiff, like the plaintiff in<italic>Connecticut Water Co. v. Thomaston,</italic> has failed to alleged a legally sufficient CUTPA violation. "[Construing] the facts in the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff"; (internal quotation marks omitted) <italic>Faulkner v. United Technologies Corp.,</italic><italic>supra,</italic> <cross_reference>240 Conn. 580</cross_reference>; the court agrees with the defendant that, as pleaded, the plaintiff is not within the class of consumers, competitors, or other business persons whose interests CUTPA was enacted to protect. In count five, the plaintiff alleges that it is in the business of owning, managing and developing real property and that the defendant is in the business of distributing and selling electricity. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendant's conduct, i.e., trespassing upon the plaintiff's property, cutting trees, timber and shrubs and erecting poles and utility lines, constitutes a violation of CUTPA. These allegations do not bring the plaintiff's claim within the purview of CUTPA. As Judge Corradino noted in<italic>Connecticut Water Co. v. Thomaston, supra,</italic> Superior Court, Docket No. CV 94 0535590, in addition to protecting consumers against unfair trade practices, CUTPA also protects "competitors or other business people harmed in the competitive marketplace who thereby lose business that should have otherwise been theirs CT Page 3530 as a result of their hard work and fair dealing. The act [was not] meant to protect any individual or business who happened to be harmed no matter what the context or relationship between the wrongdoer and the claimant."

Based on the foregoing, the defendant's motion to strike count five of the amended complaint is granted. Because the plaintiff's claim is not within the purview of CUTPA, the court need not decide whether the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that the defendant's conduct was immoral, oppressive or unscrupulous.

Accordingly, the court denies the defendant's motion to strike count four (slander of title) of the plaintiff's amended complaint and grants the defendant's motion to strike count five (CUTPA) of the amended complaint.
