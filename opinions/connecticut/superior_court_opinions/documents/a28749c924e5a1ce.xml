<opinion_text><unpublished>  The respondent moves to dismiss the first count of the Amended Petition dated July 1, 2005 pursuant to Connecticut Practice Book (CPB) ยง <cross_reference>23-29</cross_reference>(3) and <cross_reference>23-29</cross_reference>(2).

The respondent asserts that the petitioner filed a previous habeas corpus petition regarding the same convictions under Docket Number CV 96-0384649 in the District of New Haven which on January 10, 1997 was dismissed; the instant petition fails to state new facts or proffer new evidence not available in the previous action and finally that petitioner has abused the writ when the instant claims could have been raised in the previous petition. <italic>Jasello v. Manson,</italic> <cross_reference>12 Conn.App. 268</cross_reference>
at page 271, the court held:

<block_quote>  Decisions concerning abuse of the writ are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. "theirs is the major responsibility, for the just and sound administration of collateral remedies, and theirs must be the judgment as to whether a second or successive application shall be denied without consideration of the merits." The petitioner bears a heavy burden on appeal to show that the trial court abused its broad discretion. Further, on appeal of a habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner must show a miscarriage of justice beyond a mere error that might have entitled him to relief on direct appeal. (Internal quotations omitted; citations omitted.)</block_quote>

Petitioner argues when alleging abuse of the writ that the state bears the burden of showing the prior history of the case (see transcript of decision Sullivan, J.) dated January 10, 1997 at page 56) "that the petitioner states his pleas were not made knowing]y and voluntarily and he CT Page 13560 alleges that his counsel, trial counsel attorney Klein, was ineffective, Attorney Klein, having replaced his prior counsel, Attorney Gold about four months prior to his trial commencing"; the court found after hearing the evidence in this matter the petitioner failed to sustain his burden of proof on either prong of the test laid down in <italic>Strickland v.</italic><italic>Washington,</italic> <cross_reference>466 U.S. 668</cross_reference>. The burden then shifts to petitioner to disprove abuse of the writ by showing either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice <italic>McClesky v. Zaut,</italic> <cross_reference>499 US 467</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>494-95</cross_reference>
(1991). The court finds that the petitioner has failed to meet his burden.

The petitioner has just reworded the claims as ineffective assistance of counsel in the First Count without any new claims that could have been made before and essentially are raising the same grounds that could have been made before in the previous petition.

Accordingly, the court grants the motion to dismiss the First Count of the petition dated July 1, 2005.
