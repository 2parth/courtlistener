<opinion_text><unpublished>  This is an action commenced by the plaintiff wife by complaint dated August 25, 1999 and made returnable to this court on September 21, 1999 seeking a dissolution of marriage on the grounds of an irretrievable breakdown. Additionally, the plaintiff seeks an equitable division of the parties' real and personal property, alimony, attorneys fees and such other relief as the court may deem just and equitable.

The defendant appeared by counsel and filed an answer and cross complaint seeking a dissolution of marriage, an equitable division of the parties' real and personal property, alimony, attorneys fees, such other relief as the court deems just and equitable and transfer of plaintiff's interest in 79 Willington Avenue, Stafford Springs, Ct. and in 74 Crooked S. Road, Stafford, Ct.

On June 10th, 11th and June 12th, 2003, this matter was tried to the court having been previously claimed to the limited contested list. The parties were represented throughout the proceedings by counsel. Testimony was received from the plaintiff, the defendant and a number of witnesses. From the testimony and evidence produced at the trial and after assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the court finds the following to have been proven.

The parties were intermarried on March 8, 1986 in Stafford Springs, Connecticut. There were no minor children issue of this marriage and no children were born to the wife since the date of this marriage. Neither party is receiving any state, federal or local assistance. The parties have resided in this state for more than one year immediately prior to the date of the complaint. The court finds that it has jurisdiction over the parties and the marriage.

Based upon a review of the exhibits as well as the testimony at trial, the court finds the following additional facts. CT Page 8172

The plaintiff is 50 years old. She received an Associates Degree in nursing from the Greater Hartford Community College in 1978 and is a licensed Registered Nurse. In addition, the plaintiff also received a B. A. degree in Business Administration from the Eastern Connecticut College in 1989.

Prior to her marriage to the defendant in 1986, the plaintiff resided with the defendant at the defendant's residence at 79 Willington Avenue, in Stafford, Ct. She presently resides in said residence. The plaintiff also has a son from another relationship that had lived with the parties until he moved out just before his 16th birthday to live with his grandparents.

The plaintiff is employed as a medical examiner in the workers' compensation department of the Travelers Property Casualty Company. From said employment, she grosses $1239.00 and nets $726.00 a week. She has been employed at the Travelers since 1989.

Testimony was given by the plaintiff that during the marriage, the defendant subjected her to verbal, mental and physical abuse. She testified that the defendant threatened her life and made unusual sexual requests upon her. The plaintiff also claims to have been sexually assaulted by the defendant during the marriage. It is also claimed by the plaintiff that her son was physically and mentally abused by the defendant during her marriage which ultimately led to her son leaving the marital residence. Testimony was also given by the plaintiff that the defendant had affairs during the marriage including one that occurred in May of 1999 while on a vacation in Mexico. The plaintiff characterized the defendant as a person with a very bad temper who was unreasonably controlling of her.

Despite the problems she had with the defendant, the plaintiff testified that she greatly valued her marital vows and desired to save the marriage. Accordingly, she endured the abuse until she made the decision to file for the divorce. The parties separated in June of 2000.

The defendant husband is 52 years old. His education includes high school and two years of technical school. He is employed at New England Mechanical Services as a HVAC technician grossing $1090.00 and netting $708.00 a week. He also nets $10.00 per week from odd jobs.

The defendant is now residing in a room at property owned by a friend as well as staying at 74 Crooked S. Road in Stafford, Ct.

It was testified by the defendant that the parties' marital home at 79 CT Page 8173 Willington Avenue, Stafford, Ct. was purchased by him prior to his marriage. He paid approximately $22,500.00 for the property as well as other expenses that totaled approximately $6,000.00. The property was secured by a mortgage that was paid monthly by both the parties until it was fully paid off in 1999.

The defendant denies that he mistreated the plaintiff. He further denies that he abused the plaintiff's son although he admits that the son clearly was a cause of friction between the parties. While he admits that he asked the plaintiff to experiment sexually with him, he denies that he forced her into any sexual activity stating that at times she was receptive to his requests and at times she was not. He denies any abuse of alcohol. The defendant also denied he was involved in any affairs during the marriage.

Mr. Rieder attributes the breakdown of the marriage to the normal problems that married couples experience. He acknowledges that he should have been more responsive to his wife, less argumentative and should have spent more time at home. The difficulties experienced by the plaintiff's son also contributed to the breakdown of the marriage according to the defendant.

The parties presented the court with written stipulations as to the real estate and specific personal property. The stipulation in regard to the real estate provided that 74 Crooked S. Road was worth $121,000.00 and that the husband would receive said property as a partial property settlement. In addition, 79 Willington Avenue was valued at $120,000.00 and was to be given to the wife as a partial property settlement. The court orders are in accordance with the stipulations.

The defendant admits having given his sister $45,000.00 as a gift prior to the dissolution of marriage action being filed. He believed that his sister was suffering from serious health problems and he wanted to assist her.

The defendant also paid his sister during the pendency of the dissolution action rent of $1500.00 per month even though he acknowledges that during a portion of the rental period he was still living with the plaintiff. The checking account that the rent was deposited into was in the name of his sister and the defendant.

On March 5, 1996, the defendant received a workers' compensation award of $16,605.00 as a result of an injury to his right arm.

In June of 2000, the defendant inherited a gross amount of $111,000.00 CT Page 8174 from the estate of his mother and after taxes claims to have netted approximately $86,000.00. The plaintiff disputes the amount of funds remaining from the estate settlement believing it to be a lesser amount.

The court finds that this has been a marriage of seventeen years. Both parties made consistent and significant financial contributions to the marriage. In addition, both parties are in good health and are capable of supporting themselves.

The breakdown of the marriage can be attributed to multiple causes. The difficulties that the parties faced in balancing a family that included the plaintiff's son from another relationship contributed to the demise of this marriage. The court also recognizes that both parties clearly had differences in values that also contributed to the breakdown of the marriage. Neither party is solely responsible for the above two factors. Conflicting testimony was given concerning the defendant's alleged infidelity and the court is unable to make a finding in regards thereto. However, the court also finds that the greater share of the responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage lies with the defendant. The defendant's controlling nature and his temper created stresses that the marriage was unable to endure.
