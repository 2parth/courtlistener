<opinion_text><unpublished>  The complaint in this matter alleges the following facts. Frank Kalakay and Mae Parson had a long-term relationship, during which they deposited money in jointly owned bank accounts. Parson executed a power of attorney prior to her death that designated Joan Everlith, the defendant, her nephew's wife, as her attorney-in-fact. The power of attorney granted her the authority to make deposits and withdrawals from those joint accounts. Between the execution of the power of attorney and Parson's death, the defendant withdrew money from the joint accounts. The defendant claims that she withdrew the money and deposited it into a checking account which she used for the benefit of Parson while she was alive. The plaintiff the estate of Frank Kalakay, claims that the defendant, who was a beneficiary under Parson's will, used the money for her own interests by converting the funds so that it would go to Parson's, probate estate and not to the plaintiff.

The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment dated July 15, 2005, in which she argues that no genuine issue of fact exists because she used the money exactly as she was directed to by Parson. The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion on August 4, 2005. Both parties also filed exhibits supporting their positions.

"Summary judgment is a method of resolving litigation when pleadings, affidavits, and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law . . . The motion for summary judgment is designed to eliminate the delay and expense of litigating an issue when there is no real issue to be tried." (Citations omitted.) <italic>Wilson v.

"As the party moving for summary judgment, the [movant] is required to support its motion with supporting documentation, including affidavits." <italic>Heyman Associates No. 1</italic><italic>v. Ins.

Likewise, "[t]he existence of the genuine issue of material fact must be demonstrated by counteraffidavits and concrete evidence."

In this case, there exists a genuine issue of fact regarding the amount of money withdrawn, where the withdrawn money went and for what purpose it was used. The plaintiff contends the money was allocated for the defendant's own benefit while the defendant contends it was used for the benefit of Parson. In addition, affidavits, copies of bank books, and other documents supporting the motion for summary judgment and the objection may not fully account for all of the withdrawn money. Therefore, because a genuine issue of material fact exists, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied. CT Page 14064-fd
