</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiffs, Norman and Jan Bryn instituted suit against Roger Bryn by complaint dated March 14, 2003. The plaintiffs are the brother and father respectively of the defendant, Roger Bryn. In the initial complaint as well as the amended complaint of April 23, 2003, the plaintiffs allege since 1984, the defendant, Roger Bryn, has subjected them to numerous instances of criminal misconduct including outbursts resulting in damage to the Bryn family residence at 29 Sundance Drive, Greenwich, CT, as well as personal threats and assaults on both plaintiffs. Specifically, they also allege that the defendant was expelled from the family home due to his obsessive, threatening and violent conduct. They allege he has made numerous attempts to enter this residence despite being told to stay off the premises. The trial testimony referred to the following episodes. He made a practice of making harassing and threatening phone calls to the plaintiffs' residence. On December 5, 1988, they allege the defendant was arrested for breach of peace stemming from the June 17, 1986 incident. On September 2, 1990, it is alleged that the defendant attacked his father, plaintiff Jan Bryn, and repeated this assault as the father attempted to enter the residence at 29 Sundance Drive. The plaintiffs allege he threatened to kill his mother at her work place resulting in a temporary restraining order being issued. There is an allegation that the defendant impersonated his brother when driving and being stopped for operating an unregistered motor vehicle. This allegation was not proven. On November 22, 1991, the defendant was arrested for violation of probation and on April 15, 1992, he pled guilty to this charge. On July 3, 1994, he was arrested for violation of probation CT Page 13865 allegedly for harassing his mother. On June 13, 1996, he stalked, harassed and threatened his father. On July 17, 1999, the plaintiff brother was threatened and assaulted by the defendant and again in July of 2000, the brother was attacked by the defendant in Cos Cob, CT. On December 18, 2000, it is alleged the defendant threatened to kill his father and an arrest followed this incident. There is a further allegation on May 3, 2001, that the defendant threatened to blow up the Old Greenwich Elementary School resulting in his arrest on June 8, 2001. On December 3, 2001, the defendant was sentenced to incarceration for the pending charges against him. In May 2002, it is alleged he intended to get a gun and would "rot in jail" for killing Norman Bryn, blaming the latter for the death of a sister. In September of 2002, the defendant allegedly stalked the brother, Norman, on the Metro-North railroad. In November of 2002, the defendant relocated to Florida, and after he threatened to kill his father, he was ordered to return to Connecticut by the probation department.

In addition to the aforementioned abusive, threatening and violent behavior by the defendant as alleged by his brother and father, Norman, testified that he drew graffiti of a cartoonish nature at the Old Greenwich Railroad Station involving threatening behavior toward Norman. The graffiti consisted of a bullet in his head and referring to the plaintiff as fatball (a name referred to Norman from his youth). On July 11, 2005, the plaintiff, Norman Bryn, testified that a confrontation occurred at a movie theatre, at which point the defendant shouted "why don't you fight me." Another episode occurred on September 24, 2003 in the park when the defendant confronted his mother and Norman when the defendant approached them in violation of the restraining order, at which time he was shouting profanities. Norman, in testifying as to the aforementioned graffiti, stated that he recognized his brother's handwriting. He submitted photographs of the graffiti, Exhibits 3 through 7 wherein statements were made referring to "fatball," Jeffrey Dahmer, thief, a hole in head, FU, and "I live to murder fatball." Finally, on July 11, 2005, at the Old Greenwich Station in the area of or on the utility box, graffiti was CT Page 13866 alleged to have been written against Norman by the defendant. The plaintiffs admitted into evidence numerous letters written by the defendant and submitted these letters for examination to their handwriting expert, Peggy Kahn, together with photos of the graffiti for a determination as to whether the graffiti was done by the defendant. The plaintiffs also called as witnesses, the following individuals: Detective Anthony Fiscella of the Greenwich Police Department, Peter Guglielmo, a clinical social worker for the Dubois Center in Stamford; Attorney Michael Columbo, a former state's attorney in this judicial district; Mrs. Nanette Bryn, mother of Norman and Roger and the former wife of Jan Bryn; and Peggy Kahn of Norwalk who testified as a handwriting expert and the defendant. Detective Fiscella testified that he had been appointed as a liaison between the Greenwich Police Department and the Bryn family. He testified that as a result of numerous complaints from the Bryn family against Roger Bryn and request for their assistance and safety, he prepared with the approval of his department, a flyer about Roger Bryn which was disseminated to the entire Greenwich Police force. The flyer consisted of a two-page document with background about Roger Bryn and the family disputes with the second page showing facial poses of Roger similar to a wanted poster. He further testified that his department had prepared such flyers in the past. The mother, Nanette Bryn, testified as to the ill feelings between her family and her son, Roger, over many years and she corroborated portions of Norman Bryn's testimony regarding threats made by Roger. Attorney Columbo testified that during his tenure as state's attorney he prosecuted Roger Bryn and specifically concerning the reason for termination of his probation based on the defendant's relocation to Florida. Peter Guglielmo testified as to his position as a clinical social worker at the Dubois Center in Stamford. He testified that he saw the defendant frequently except when he was residing in Florida. He also disclosed two occasions when he had to divulge confidential statements made by the defendant to him. The first incident was on or about May 1, 2003 when the defendant at the center made a statement in which he said he was going to kill his brother and father. On the same day, the defendant said he would call the police and taunt them and then he would kill CT Page 13867 himself. The second incident took place on July 20, 2005 while walking with the defendant to the Stamford Superior Court for a hearing. The defendant, who was agitated, made a threatening remark about Attorney Gazin and that he would body slam him. The defendant was called as a witness by the plaintiffs, at which time the letters written by the defendant were stipulated to by both counsel and admitted into evidence. He (Roger) testified as to his mental condition and that he had been taking anti-depressant medication since 1993. He admitted being upset with his brother, Norman, although he denied threatening to kill him. He testified that he didn't recognize the graffiti and that his medication did affect his memory. In fact, he testified that he never authored the graffiti at the Old Greenwich station and was seeing it for the first time at trial. He admitted that the family had told him to stay away from them. He testified he is prepared to stay away from Norman, his father and family if they do not want him to be with them. Some of the harassment and threats alleged, the defendant admitted. They are: screaming and yelling at his father at the bank although denying that he pushed his father. In the courthouse, he remembers having words with his father in the bathroom. As to the June 1996 incident, he recalls bumping into his father but denied chasing him. Again, on December 16, 2000, he admitted the phone call where he threatened to kill Norman but he claims he was intoxicated at that time. In May of 2003, he recalls making statements to the social worker but he could not recall what he said on that occasion. He claimed also that Norman has persecuted him for the last twenty years. With respect to the 1999 train incident he claimed everything happened so fast and all he remembers was that his brother was on top of him at the door of the train or adjoining platform.

Peggy Kahn, the handwriting expert, confirmed that Roger was the author of the graffiti at the Old Greenwich railroad station. She clearly pointed out several identifying characteristics in the graffiti which she identified as consistent with the defendant's writing style. For example, the exclamation points, underlining, reference to "fatball," the letter "A," the letter "M" and other characteristics of Roger's handwriting. This court is clearly satisfied that the CT Page 13868 defendant authored the referenced graffiti.

As to the defendant's care and presentation of evidence, he called Michael Stanford, a friend and fellow caddy, who had worked with the defendant. He testified as to the 1999 railroad station incident. He recalled that the train had stopped at Old Greenwich. He saw Norman walk over to Roger and a conversation ensued. Then Norman was yelling at Roger and they began tussling on the platform and he pulled Roger away. No one was hurt in this incident.

During the course of the defendant's testimony, he indicated he was objecting to and opposed to the request for the injunction. He felt it would jeopardize his future and employment. He recited the response generated by the flyer after it was issued. He testified to an incident on the train when a conductor recognized him, had the train stopped, the Greenwich police were notified and he was taken off the train, handcuffed by the police and ultimately released after about twenty minutes when there was no warrant against him. This situation caused him considerable embarrassment.

The court, having heard all of the evidence, is satisfied that the evidence bears out many of the plaintiffs' complaint resulting from the defendant's action and conduct toward them. As stated above, the court is also satisfied that the defendant authored the graffiti at the Old Greenwich railroad station.

"A party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law. The allegations and proof are conditions precedent to the granting of an injunction. These elements are so crucial that a party's failure to allege and prove them is sufficient grounds for sustaining the refusal to grant an injunction, even where a court's conclusions on the merits are erroneous." (Citations omitted; internal quotations omitted.) <italic>Bristol Resource Recovery Facility v.</italic><italic>Bristol,</italic> No. CV 92 0453461, Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain (June 30, 1995, Parker, J.) Here, the plaintiffs have failed to prove these critical allegations, those of irreparable harm and lack of an CT Page 13869 adequate remedy at law. The plaintiff's recourse in the past in obtaining the police and MTA flyers has had a significant impact on the defendant's activities. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have access to relief from abuse under Section <cross_reference>46b-15</cross_reference>(a) of the Connecticut General Statutes which reads in part as follows: "Any family or household member . . . who has been subjected to a continuous threat of present physical pain or physical injury by another family or household member . . . may make application to the Superior Court for relief under this section. The episodes resulting in the defendant's arrests, the disseminating of the flyers and the provision of § <cross_reference>46b-15</cross_reference>(a) clearly provide the plaintiffs with an adequate remedy at law.

Lastly, he testified that he was objecting to the request for an injunction because it jeopardizes his future. As to the effect or response to the flyer, he testified that the conductor on the train recognized him, stopped the train and called the Greenwich police department who took him off the train, handcuffed him and subjected him to an embarrassing situation.

Accordingly, the plaintiff's request for an injunction is denied and judgment may enter in favor of the defendant. CT Page 13870
