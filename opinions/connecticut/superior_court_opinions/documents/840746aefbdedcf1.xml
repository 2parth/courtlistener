The plaintiffs, Henry A. Backe and Tara Backe, own property located at 388 Old Post Road, Fairfield. The Backe property abuts that owned by the plaintiffs, James A. Miller and Joyce Miller, located at 406 Old Post Road, Fairfield.

Both contiguous parcels (Ex. 4) are located in a residential zone (Residence A). Each contains a single-family residential dwelling.

The defendant, Post-Benson Corporation, is a Connecticut corporation, which owns property located at the intersection of South Benson Road and the Post Road, Fairfield. Most of the property is situated in a designed commercial district, and is the site of a shopping center.

A small portion of the land owned by the Post-Benson Corporation is located in an A residence zone. This portion abuts the property of all of the plaintiffs.

The Post-Benson Corporation property which is not part of the designed commercial district is a strip of land, approximately 60 feet in depth, and running 336.38 feet in an east to west direction (Ex. 4  5). A stockade fence, which separates the shopping center from the single-family home adjacent to it, runs along the boundary line separating the designed commercial district and the residence A zone to the south.

Prior to November 2006, the property owned by the defendant which was zoned Residence A, had been maintained by the plaintiffs, as part of their respective back yards. The defendant's land was indistinguishable from that owned by the plaintiffs, or their predecessors in title.

The plaintiffs, James and Joyce Miller, took title to their property CT Page 6790 on October 10, 1975 (Ex. 1), by way of a deed recorded at Volume 611, pages 197-99 of the Fairfield land records. The plaintiffs, Henry and Tara Backe, acquired their home on February 16, 1996 (Ex. 2) through a deed recorded at Volume 1563, pages 332-33 of the Fairfield land records.

In November 2006, the defendant Post-Benson Corporation, erected a chain link fence to the rear of the plaintiffs' properties, running along the boundary between those properties, and the residentially zoned portion of the defendant's property. The erection of the chain link fence, without warning and without any reason being provided to the plaintiffs, dramatically altered the back yards of both parcels (Ext. 12-15 and 17-21).

The plaintiffs instituted this action, by way of a four-count complaint, following the construction of the chain link fence by the Post-Benson Corporation.

They have also sought, in a request for an injunction, that the fence be removed while the action is pending. A hearing was held concerning the plaintiffs' request for temporary relief, at which time the history of dealings between the parties was explained.

In December 1979, the defendant, Post-Benson Corporation reached an agreement with the plaintiffs James and Joyce Miller, and with Frank and Marion D'Elia, the predecessors in title of Henry and Tara Backe (Ex. 3).

The agreement was in response to the settlement of two legal actions concerning decisions of the Zoning Commission and the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Fairfield.

The agreement provided for the construction and maintenance of a fence along the line separating the designed commercial district, and the residence A zone. The portion of the defendant's land zoned residence A, was therefore separated from the shopping center, and was not utilized in the operation of the commercial enterprises.

The property located to the south of the stockade fence which abutted 388 and 406 Old Post Road was leased to the Millers and the D'Elias. The consideration was $1.00 (Ex. 3, p. 2-3).

The term of the lease was 10 years, with a right to renew for an additional five years. The lease term began on December 12, 1979.

CT Page 6791 In order to exercise the right to renew, the lease mandated that written notice be provided no later than six months prior to the end of the 10-year term (Ex. 3, p. 5).

There is no evidence that a writing was ever executed extending the term of the lease beyond December 12, 1989, and no mention of any extension or renewal was recorded on the Fairfield land records.

In the summer of 1998, prior to the end of the 10-year term, discussions began concerning a new lease (Ex. 7-10). A proposed lease (Ex. 7) was sent by the Post-Benson Corporation to James Miller.

Although the lease agreement contained a provision permitting renewal for an additional five years, and rights enjoyed by the plaintiffs during the extension were somewhat illusionary. The Post-Benson Corporation enjoyed the right to terminate the lease during any extension, if a need for the property for a use other than business or parking could be shown (Ex. 3, p. 5, Par. 2(d)).

Despite the 1998 negotiations, no renewal of the existing lease or agreement on the terms of a new lease was ever achieved (Ex. 7-10).

When the Backes purchased 388 Old Post Road in 1993, a letter from their attorney (Ex. 11) seemed to assume that an extension of the original lease was in effect. However, only the original agreement (Ex. 3) signed by Frank and Marion D'Elia was produced. There is no evidence that the D'Elias ever requested an extension of that lease in writing.

Prior to November of 2006, both the Millers and the Backes maintained the strip between the stockade fence and their property line as part of the back yard. The area was indistinguishable from the back yards from a visual standpoint, and was used by family members and guests before the fence was erected (Ex. 12-15).

Improvements to the areas, including the planting of trees, installation of a sprinkler system and play equipment, grading and seeding, were made by all of the plaintiffs. Costs were expended in making these improvements.

During 2006, both the Millers and the Backes became involved in a legal challenge, concerning a proposed use of a portion of the defendant's shopping center as an Appleby's restaurant. In order to accommodate the proposed restaurant, the defendant, Post-Benson Corporation requested and received a variance of certain parking regulations from the Zoning Board of appeals of the Town of Fairfield. CT Page 6792

The plaintiffs, all of whom were statutorily aggrieved parties who owned land abutting the Post-Benson property, appealed the decision.

On August 25, 2006, the plaintiffs' appeal was sustained, based upon a finding the record did not support a determination of a legally cognizable hardship (CV05 4013 115 S, J.D. of Fairfield at Bridgeport).

In this action the plaintiffs allege, in Count One, that the defendant, Post-Benson Corporation, erected the chain link fence because of a desire to retaliate following the successful appeal of the decision rendered by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

Count One is brought pursuant to ยง <cross_reference>52-570</cross_reference> of the General Statutes, which authorizes an action based upon the malicious erection of a structure. The statute reads:

<block_quote>  An action may be maintained by the proprietor of any land against the owner or lessee of land adjacent, who maliciously erects any structure thereon, with the intent to annoy or injure the plaintiff in the use or disposition of his land.</block_quote>

Another section of the General Statutes, ยง <cross_reference>52-480</cross_reference>, provides for injunctive relief, as a remedy. That statute provides:

<block_quote>  An injunction may be granted against the malicious erection by or with the consent of the owner, lessee or person entitled to possession of land, of any structure upon it, intended to annoy or injure the owner or lessee of adjacent land with respect to his use or disposition of the same.</block_quote>

The remaining counts involve claims for breach of a lease (Count Two), conversion (Count Three) and adverse possession (Count Four).

Only Count One is germane at this time, where the issue is whether a temporary injunction requesting temporary relief should be issued, and the chain link fence removed while the action is pending.

<center>          <italic>PLAINTIFFS HAVE PROVEN PROBABLE SUCCESS ON THE MERITS</italic></center>
In situations where a temporary injunction is requested, a plaintiff must ordinarily demonstrate a reasonable degree of probability of CT Page 6793 success on the merits before a temporary injunction may be issued.<italic>Griffin Hospital v. Commission on Hospital and Health Care</italic>,<cross_reference>196 Conn. 451</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>458</cross_reference> (1985).

The plaintiffs contend that the showing of probable success and proof of irreparable harm is not necessary in light of the language of ยง<cross_reference>52-480</cross_reference>, C.G.S. They maintain that an injunction may issue, following a finding that a structure has been erected with the intention of annoying or injuring a person in possession of property.

While this position has some appeal, the facts, presented at the order to show cause hearing, support a finding that the plaintiffs will properly succeed on the merits of the Count One claim.

The evidence reflects a situation in which all plaintiffs treated the property as a part of their back yards for many years. Improvements were made in the area, and maintenance was the responsibility of the plaintiffs, not the defendant corporation.

No artificial or natural structure or barrier delineated the boundary between the plaintiffs' properties and the residentially zoned portion of the defendant's land, which is adjacent to the stockade fence erected along the zone boundary.

At no time during the initial ten-year period of the lease or any alleged extension, did the defendant corporation seek to separate its land from that of the plaintiffs. Although negotiations conducted in 1998 were not successful, at no time did the defendant suggest, by word or deed, a desire to separate or segregate its residentially zoned property from the plaintiffs' land.

Nor is the land in question utilized, in any way, in the operation of the commercial shopping center located at the intersection of South Benson Road and the Post Road. There is no indication that the defendant ever sought a change in zoning classification in order to incorporate the strip into its commercial enterprise.

Only after the plaintiffs successfully contested an attempt by the Post-Benson Corporation to locate another restaurant in the shopping center was the land divided, without notice or apparent reason.

The defendant's claim that the fence was erected to prevent further complaints and to simply designate the boundary line between the properties, is not credible.

CT Page 6794 The refusal of representatives of the defendant, Post-Benson Corporation, to respond to requests for an explanation for the action, also supports a finding that the erection of the fence was an act of malice directed towards the plaintiffs.

The defendant does not, and cannot, claim that the action in any way enhanced the operation of the shopping center, or benefitted any of the commercial tenants.

Coming less than three months following an unfavorable zoning decision, the linkage between that decision and the subsequent erection of the chain link fence is inescapable.

It is found that the erection of the chain link fence was malicious and was intended to annoy or injure the plaintiffs in the use of their properties. Therefore, there is probable cause to support a verdict for the plaintiffs as to Count One.

<center>           <italic>EQUITIES OF THE SITUATION MITIGATE IN FAVOR OF THE</italic><italic>PLAINTIFFS</italic></center>
Simply because it is found that there is probable cause to believe that the plaintiffs will prevail in the claims raised in Count One does not mean that an injunction should automatically issue.

In adjusting the rights of the parties while litigation is pending and until a final determination on the merits can be obtained, a court must consider, particularly where mandatory injunctive relief is requested, the relative position of all parties to the litigation. This requires a balancing based upon the equities of the case, including comparing the injury complained of, with any injury which will result from the granting of the injunctive relief requested. <italic>Walton v. New</italic><italic>Hartford</italic>, <cross_reference>223 Conn. 155</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>157</cross_reference> (1992). <italic>Dupuis v. Submarine Base Credit</italic><italic>Unit, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>170 Conn. 334</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>356</cross_reference> (1976).

A consideration of all of the relevant factors requires the granting of the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs.

The failure to grant the plaintiffs the relief requested, would effectively deny them the use of a strip of land which had been indistinguishable from the remainder of their back yards prior to the erection of the fence.

The area has been maintained and improved by the plaintiffs, and structures have been erected inside the fence for use by the plaintiffs CT Page 6795 and members of their families. The erection of the fence has prohibited entry into certain areas and made access to personal property and improvements more difficult.

Furthermore, there was apparently no demand by the Post-Benson Corporation to the plaintiffs to remove items of personal property prior to the surprise construction of the barrier.

Photographs and testimony of the parties indicates that the chain link fence is not difficult to remove and could be retained by the defendant corporation pending the outcome of this litigation.

The fence has absolutely no utility to the nearby shopping center, or to any business located in the shopping center.

Its only purpose, as demonstrated by the evidence and the exhibits, is to frustrate, harass, annoy and irritate the plaintiffs. The timing of the construction in relation to the plaintiffs' successful challenge to a zoning appeal, can not be seen as coincidental or irrelevant.

Because the mandatory injunction should issue concerning Count One, no finding is made concerning whether any or all of the plaintiffs will prevail on their claim of adverse possession at the time of trial. Whether any of the plaintiffs possessed the disputed strip openly, continuously and notoriously for a period of fifteen years under a claim of right, and with the intent to use the property as their own, represents a question of fact which need not be determined at this time.<italic>Whitney v. Turmel</italic>, <cross_reference>180 Conn. 147</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>148</cross_reference> (1980); <italic>Lord v. Mansfield</italic>, 50 Conn.App. 21, 31 (1998).

<center>                          <italic>ORDER AND CONCLUSION</italic></center>
A temporary injunction ordering the defendant, Post-Benson Corporation, acting through its agents and/or employees, to remove the chain link fence installed across the plaintiffs' rear yards is<italic>GRANTED</italic>.

It is further ordered, that during the pendency of this action, the plaintiffs, Henry A. Backe, Tara Backe, James A. Miller and Joyce Miller, shall have the right to enter the disputed area of residentially zoned property for the purpose of maintaining and using the property. The defendant, Post-Benson Corporation, shall not obstruct access to the property, or do anything to interfere with the use and enjoyment of the properties by the plaintiffs.

CT Page 6796 The mandatory temporary injunction as requested by the plaintiffs may issue.
