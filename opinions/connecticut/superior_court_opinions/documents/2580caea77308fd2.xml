</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  On October 12, 2004, the plaintiff commenced a foreclosure action against several parties including the defendant James C. Lestorti. The address listed on the Writ, Summons and Complaint for the defendant, James C. Lestorti, is 30 Maybrook Road, Waterbury, CT 06702. On December 27, 2004, a default for failure to appear was entered against the defendant James C. Lestorti.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> On August 8, 2005, a judgment of strict foreclosure was entered by the court, Eveleigh, J. All the defendants failed to redeem and title vested in the plaintiff on December 12, 2005. On January 5, 2006, the plaintiff filed a motion for a deficiency judgment against the parties. On January 19, 2006, counsel filed an appearance for the defendant James C. Lestorti, along with a motion to dismiss the complaint and the subsequent motion for a deficiency judgment pursuant to Practice Book § <cross_reference>10-31</cross_reference>(a) claiming a lack of jurisdiction based upon insufficient service. An objection to this motion was filed by the substitute plaintiff JPSD, Inc. on March 3, 2006. The court heard evidence and argument on April 7, 2006.

The defendant James C. Lestorti's claim is that he was never served personally or by abode service pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-57</cross_reference>(a), which read: "process in any civil action shall be served by leaving a true and attested copy of it, including the declaration of complaint, with the defendant, or at his usual place of abode, in this state."

Marshall Fisher's amended return of service indicates that on September 10, 2004 he left a verified true and attested copy of the original Summons, Complaint, Application for Appointment of Receiver and Order to show Cause at the usual place of abode of the within named defendant James C. Lestorti at 86 Middleway East, Waterbury, Ct. 06702. CT Page 8129 The defendant's argument is that 86 Middleway East, Waterbury had not been his usual place of abode since May 24, 2004 when he sold the property to Daniel J. and Nancy McCormick Griffin, persons unrelated to him. That as a result of this failure of service, he never received proper notice of this action and thus, the court has no jurisdiction over him.

The plaintiff does not dispute that it attempted to make abode service upon James C. Lestorti at the Middleway East address on September 10, 2004, and that this address was not his usual place of abode. The plaintiff however argues that the legal principles of common-law waiver and estoppel should operate here to preclude the defendant from now arguing the court's lack of jurisdiction over him due to insufficient process. The plaintiff proffers that the defendant had actual notice of the foreclosure action and submitted as evidence of this notice that 1) the defendant attended a meeting with a Wachovia Bank officer in New Jersey in November 2004, where a workout was discussed, and 2) a series of emails,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> between Atty. John Dolan on behalf of Mr. Lestorti and Atty. Joseph Lubertazzi where a purchase of the property in question and a release of Mr. Lestorti's obligations as a guarantor was discussed. The court is satisfied that Mr. Lestorti had actual notice of the foreclosure and for him to feign ignorance is not plausible.

The question here is, does actual notice override the statutory service requirements of § <cross_reference>52-57</cross_reference>(a). Both parties point to this court's recent decision in <italic>Angelicola v. Rrcel et al,</italic> Docket No. CV 055000547, Judicial District of Waterbury, January 27, 2006, [<cross_reference>40 Conn. L. Rptr. 646</cross_reference>] in support of their respective positions. In that case this court found, that even when it was determined that the abode where service was made was not the usual place of abode of the defendant, but that a good faith effort was made to determine if the abode was the correct one and actual notice was given to the defendants, service was sufficient. In <italic>Angelicola,</italic> the plaintiff's secretary had made phone contact with a person at the residence who confirmed the defendants lived there. The Marshal when serving the papers spoke to a person who answered the door who acknowledged knowing the defendants, personally accepted the papers and in fact turned them over to the defendants as evidenced by an appearance in the action by an Attorney for the defendants' insurance company three weeks after the service.

The defendant argues that in this case there is no evidence of CT Page 8130 any good faith effort by the plaintiff to ascertain if this was the defendant's abode and absent any such evidence the service was deficient. The plaintiff counters that even if this is true, the fact the defendant had actual notice of the action and the fact he conducted negotiations to resolve the matter renders the inadequacy of the service harmless.

[T]he Superior Court . . . may exercise jurisdiction over a person only if that person has been properly served with process, has consented to the jurisdiction of the court or has waived any objection to the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction." <italic>Kim</italic><italic>v. Magnotta,</italic> <cross_reference>249 Conn. 94</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>101-02</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>733 A.2d 809</cross_reference> (1999).

"In many cases jurisdiction is immediately evident, as where the sheriff's return shows abode service in Connecticut . . . When, however, the defendant is a resident of Connecticut who claims that no valid abode service has been made upon her that would give the court jurisdiction over her person, the defendant bears the burden of disproving personal jurisdiction. The general rule putting the burden of proof on the defendant as to jurisdictional issues raised is based on the presumption of truth of the matters stated in the officer's return. When jurisdiction is based on personal or abode service, the matters stated in the return, if true, confer jurisdiction unless sufficient evidence is introduced to prove otherwise." <italic>Knutson Mortgage Corp. v.</italic><italic>Bernier,</italic> <cross_reference>67 Conn.App. 768</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>771</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>789 A.2d 528</cross_reference>, (2002), <italic>Tax</italic><italic>Collector of City of New Haven v. Stettinger,</italic> <cross_reference>79 Conn.App. 823</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>832 A.2d 75</cross_reference> (2003).

The question of whether a particular place is the usual place of abode of a defendant is a question of fact. Although the sheriff's return is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, it may be contradicted and facts may be introduced to show otherwise. <italic>Collins v. Scholz,</italic> <cross_reference>34 Conn.Sup. 501</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>502</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>373 A.2d 200</cross_reference> (1976).

In this case, the defendant testified that he sold the property in May 2004 that he has had no contact with the property since then, he also provided as evidence a copy of the tax assessor's card showing the change of ownership and a sworn affidavit. Unlike the plaintiff in <italic>Angeliloca,</italic> the plaintiff here, did not present any evidence other than Marshal Fisher's return. There was no testimony or even an affidavit from Marshal Fisher as to what steps, if any, he took to ascertain if the 86 Middleway East was the usual place of abode of Mr. Lestorti. The court can only CT Page 8131 conclude that Marshal Fisher simply left the papers in the doorway.

The court finds based on the evidence presented that in this case the defendant was not properly served pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes § <cross_reference>52-57</cross_reference>(a). The court finds 86 Middleway East was not the defendant's usual place of abode and that no good faith effort was made by the Marshal to ascertain if that was the correct abode. The court further finds that the defendant's actions in conducting discussions with the plaintiff either directly or through counsel do not constitute waiver and estoppel. The motion to dismiss the complaint and the motion for a deficiency judgment as against the defendant James C. Lestorti for lack of jurisdiction is granted. Accordingly, the judgment is vacated as to this defendant only, and all other respects the judgment remains in effect.

In granting this motion, the court is mindful of Connecticut General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>49-1</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>49-15</cross_reference>, which preclude the opening of a judgment of strict foreclosure once title has passed. It is the court's intent that the granting of this motion serves only to preclude the plaintiff from pursuing a deficiency judgment against this defendant arising out of this action, it does not in any way effect the title to the property.
