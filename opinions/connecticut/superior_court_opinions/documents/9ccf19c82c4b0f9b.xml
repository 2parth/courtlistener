<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff, Andrew Srb, pursuant to General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>52-278a</cross_reference> et seq., seeks a prejudgment remedy (PJR) in the amount of $250,000 to attach real property owned by the defendant, Robert L. Johnson, and to attach or garnish such additional property and/or assets of the defendants Johnson and Quarry Town Stables, Inc. ("Quarry Town") as are disclosed pursuant to the plaintiff's motion for order to disclose property. Along with the application, the plaintiff filed a complaint and submitted his affidavit. The plaintiff's four-count complaint alleged three causes of action against the defendant Robert L. Johnson, including intentional infliction of emotional distress, intentional assault and battery and reckless assault and battery; as well as negligent supervision against the defendant Quarry Town.

This matter came before this court for an evidentiary hearing on November 30, 2009. The court heard testimony from the plaintiff, Andrew Srb and the defendant, Robert L. Johnson. The plaintiff introduced medical bills, medical records and the plaintiff's witness statement to the Portland Police Department as documentary evidence before the court. The defendant introduced a list of horses owned and leased by the defendant Quarry Town in 1985 and 1987 as documentary evidence before the court.

The court has reviewed the testimony of the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff's complaint and affidavit as well as the documentary evidence submitted by the plaintiff and the defendant at the time of the hearing and makes the following findings of fact.

<center>                              <italic>FINDINGS OF FACT</italic></center>
The plaintiff, who is presently thirty-seven years of age, met the defendant Johnson in approximately 1984 when he began taking horse riding lessons and training from him at the defendant Quarry Town. Quarry Town's business operation is located at 239 Sandhill Road, Portland, Connecticut CT Page 2087 and was, and continues to be, engaged in the business of horseback riding instruction and training, and other related activities. The defendant Johnson was employed by, and in the course of his employment with, the defendant Quarry Town as a horse riding instructor and trainer during the period of time that the plaintiff took lessons and training from the defendant Johnson, and he continues to be employed by the defendant Quarry Town at the present time. The plaintiff stopped attending the lessons sometime between 1984 and 1985 while he was out of the country. He returned for additional lessons with the defendant Johnson at the defendant Quarry Town in approximately 1986 when he was about fourteen years of age. Over a period of approximately six months to a year, commencing in approximately 1986 when the plaintiff was about fourteen to sixteen years of age, the defendant Johnson sexually assaulted the plaintiff on approximately five occasions. The sexual assault included sodomization and restraint of the plaintiff. The defendant Johnson's intentional actions against the plaintiff were extreme and outrageous.

As a result of said sexual assault, the plaintiff was significantly traumatized and suffered, and continues to suffer, significant psychological injuries including alcohol dependence, a history of opiate dependence, depression, emotional distress, shame, embarrassment, anxiety, an inability to maintain regular employment, insomnia, nightmares, flashbacks, relationship problems, loss of enjoyment of life's activities and impaired social functioning all of which has and continues to require in depth inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment, hospitalization and counseling. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol dependence and a history of opiate dependence. As a further result of said sexual assault and resulting injuries, the plaintiff has incurred significant medical costs for his psychological and psychiatric treatment and therapy which currently totals approximately $46,000. The plaintiff will likely require additional treatment into the future.

A prejudgment remedy is authorized by General Statutes ยง <cross_reference>52-278a</cross_reference> et seq., in order to secure sufficient assets of a defendant prior to a judgment in a civil action. <italic>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. v. Lusk</italic><italic>Corporation</italic>, <cross_reference>172 Conn. 577</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>582-83</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>376 A.2d 60</cross_reference> (1977). The applicant is required to prove probable cause that judgment may enter in favor of the plaintiff at least equal to the amount of the prejudgment remedy. <italic>Dufraine</italic><italic>v. Commission on Human Rights  Opportunities</italic>, <cross_reference>236 Conn. 250</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>261</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>673 A.2d 101</cross_reference> (1996). Probable cause must exist both as to the merits and damages taking into consideration, <italic>inter alia</italic>, defenses to the action. The standard for determining probable cause is "a bona fide belief in the CT Page 2088 existence of facts essential under the law for the action and such as would warrant a [person] of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment, under the circumstances, in entertaining it." <italic>New England Land</italic><italic>Co., Ltd. v. DeMarkey</italic>, <cross_reference>213 Conn. 612</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>620</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>569 A.2d 1098</cross_reference> (1990). "Section<cross_reference>52-278c</cross_reference>[(2)] requires that a PJR application contain an affidavit setting forth facts <italic>sufficient to show there is probable cause</italic> that a judgment in the amount of the prejudgment remedy sought . . . [or more] . . . will be in rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff." (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Smith v. Andrews</italic>, Superior Court, complex litigation docket at Stamford-Norwalk at Stamford, Docket No. X08 CV 03 0198246 (September 7, 2005, Adams, J.).

"The role of the court in considering an award of a prejudgment remedy is well established. Pursuant to our prejudgment remedy statutes . . . the trial court's function is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a judgment will be rendered in favor of the plaintiff in a trial on the merits . . . The hearing in probable cause for the issuance of a prejudgment remedy is not contemplated to be a full scale trial on the merits of the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff does not have to establish that he will prevail, only that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim . . . The court's role in such a hearing is to determine probable success by weighing probabilities . . . Probable cause is a flexible common sense standard. It does not demand that a belief be correct or more likely true than false." (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted).] <italic>J.K.</italic><italic>Scanlan Co. v. Construction Group, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>80 Conn.App. 345</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>349-50</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>835 A.2d 79</cross_reference> (2003). "Moreover, this weighing process applies to both legal and factual issues . . . It is the trial court that must determine, in light of its assessment of the legal issues and the credibility of the witnesses, whether a plaintiff has sustained the burden of showing probable cause to sustain the validity of its claim." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. v. EI</italic><italic>Constructors, Inc.</italic>, <cross_reference>32 Conn.App. 118</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>126</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>628 A.2d 601</cross_reference> (1993).

The first question before the court is whether there has been sufficient evidence presented in the affidavit and the testimony of the plaintiff at the hearing for the court to form a bona fide belief that the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by the defendant.

The testimony of the plaintiff and the documentary evidence submitted by the plaintiff clearly meets the probable cause standard for finding sexual assault against him. The plaintiff was subjected to severe and unwarranted sexual assault by the defendant Johnson while the defendant Johnson was in the course of his employment with the defendant Quarry Town. The court did not find the testimony of the defendant Johnson CT Page 2089 credible. Therefore, the court finds that sufficient facts have been presented for a finding of probable cause that the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by the defendant Johnson and that he was in the course of his employment with the defendant Quarry Town when the assaults occurred. In addition, sufficient facts have been presented to establish probable cause that the defendant Quarry Town knew or should have known of the defendant Johnson's propensity to commit the acts complained of by the plaintiff. Thus, there is probable cause to believe that a judgment in favor of the plaintiff will be obtained.

The second portion of the PJR hearing is to determine what amount of attachment of the defendants' property may be allowed, if any. It is not enough for a plaintiff to establish the first part of the prejudgment remedy equation without adequately proving that there is probable cause to find that damages in the amount of the pre-judgment remedy attachment amount will also be obtained. Based upon the evidence produced at the hearing, the plaintiff has established, to the court's satisfaction, the probability of a judgment in his favor in the amount of $250,000.

For the above stated reasons, the court grants the plaintiff's application for prejudgment remedy. Accordingly, a prejudgment remedy shall issue in the amount of $250,000 as to the defendants Robert L. Johnson and Quarry Town Stables, Inc.

The plaintiff's motion for order to disclose property is granted.
