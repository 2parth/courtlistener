</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The defendant has moved for modification of his child support order. The parties appeared at short calendar day and presented financial affidavits. Plaintiff also presented a proposed child support guidelines worksheet. The court took the papers to review the proposed child support order and hereby issues the attached child support guidelines worksheet.<footnote_reference>[fn*]</footnote_reference> In reviewing the plaintiff's proposal, the court has concluded that the plaintiff incorrectly deducted certain costs that the father incurs to support a child living with him; but under the child support guidelines, such expenses may be deducted only if an initial child support order is being entered or if the person who incurs such expenses is defending against the other parent's motion for modification of the child support order.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Thus Mr. Rodriguez is not eligible to claim the expenses he incurs for the child living with him as a deduction that will affect this child support order.

The court finds that the presumptive amount is for him to pay $86 in current child support per week. The court orders him to make weekly payments for current child support in that amount by way of wage withholding, plus 37% of unreimbursed medical expenses and the same percentage of qualifying child care costs that the mother incurs in order to work.

The court finds that she presently has qualifying child care costs of $25 per week; he shall pay his 37% share of that by way of wage withholding.

This order is retroactive to November 21, 2005, the date on which the plaintiff was served with the motion for modification.

The parties stipulated that defendant was four weeks behind in CT Page 16407 child support. He owes an arrearage of $104 for one week and $86 per week for three weeks, for a total arrearage of $362. The arrearage shall be paid, by way of wage withholding, at the rate of $17.20 per week, in addition to payments for current support. Any moneys withheld for current support in excess of $86 per week shall be credited toward his arrearage.

SO ORDERED.
