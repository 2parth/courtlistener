Although material purporting to relate to Plaintiff's claim as to this account was included in the standing order compliance, none of the documents were offered as exhibits or marked as such and no stipulation by counsel was made known to the Court.

It is the Plaintiff's hope to remain at the Lantern Hill residence.

The real estate shown on the Plaintiff's financial affidavit located in Baileyville, Maine, 14 acres, came to her incident to a divorce settlement pertaining to her first marriage.

During a portion of the marriage, the Plaintiff's son Darrin, and daughter April, issue of her first marriage, lived with the parties until July 1986 when they returned to Maine.

The Lantern Hill property was acquired in January 1990 for $17,000.00 and initially was uninhabitable, but both parties put their paychecks into fixing it up and making improvements.

From the financial affidavit of the Plaintiff the Court finds: CT Page 2939

Plaintiff's weekly gross pay is $469.42, less deductions of $75.67, for a net of $393.75.

Plaintiff has been receiving $115.00 weekly as alimony pendente lite.

Plaintiff's weekly expenses are $378.31.

Plaintiff's debts amount to $10,982.17 including counsel fees.

Plaintiff values the Lantern Hill property at $17,500.00 (the 1990 purchase price) and indicates it is free and clear.

It is to be noted, however, that this is supposedly the value of the residence only, as title to the land is in the name of the lessor of the premises.

Plaintiff values 14 acres in Baileyville, Maine, allegedly in her name, at $12,700.00.

Plaintiff shows a parcel of six acres of land in Putnam, Connecticut valued at $4,270.00 on her affidavit, but there is no exhibit or testimony indicating her source of title.

Plaintiff's financial affidavit reflects two motor vehicles, a 1987 GMC Jimmy for which no value is shown. Testimony indicates this vehicle is in her name.

The other vehicle a 1987 Chevrolet Pickup on her affidavit, the testimony discloses is in Defendant's name.

Plaintiff shows other personal property, which the testimony and agreement of the parties shows, is in the Defendant's name as valued at $30,500.00.

Plaintiff's affidavit shows an A.G. Edwards account valued at $25,000.00. This account is actually in the Defendant's name and he values it at $18,785.00.

Plaintiff also shows land and a mobile home in Chiefland Florida valued at $8,950.00, land in Interlocken, Florida valued at $1,650.00 and a building lot in Peru, Maine valued at $2,500.00, although as best the Court can devine, these parcels are all in the Defendant's name. CT Page 2940

The Defendant's financial affidavit reflects income from pensions and Social Security in the amount of $656.36 weekly, claimed weekly expenses of $772.43.

The Defendant shows $4,741.00 in debt.

The Defendant values the Lantern Hill residence at $41,500.00 free and clear.

Putnam premises, six acres at $4,270.00, although he shows the Baileyville, Maine property that is in the Plaintiff's name.

Personal property including two motor vehicles, only one of which is in his name, are overvalued in the Court's opinion.

1987 GMC Jimmy $9,000.00

1987 Chevrolet Pickup $4,000.00

The Defendant values an old wooden lobster boat, a backhoe and woodmizer at $23,000.00, although the condition thereof is suspect, the same having been out in the elements for years.

The Defendant shows approximately $2,335.00 in the bank, including the amount of $625.35 remaining in the Dime Savings account.

The Defendant values the Chiefland, Florida land with mobile home at $8,950.00, the Interlocken, Florida land at $1,650.00, and the Peru, Maine building lot at $220.00.

There was only one exhibit offered and marked in these proceedings, Plaintiff's exhibit 1 reflecting a balance due to the Lahey Clinic of $3,875.49 for the Krohns Disease surgery performed on the Plaintiff.

Admittedly, the Plaintiff, by her counsel, presumably complied with the standing orders as to proposed exhibits, but the documents were never offered during the proceedings and were never marked as exhibits.

Query as to the propriety of the Court considering the same CT Page 2941 which included tax returns and copy of one deed?

The Court is also hampered by the fact that no testimony was offered by a realtor nor were written copies of appraisals submitted as exhibits as to the values of the properties.

The Court is also hampered by virtue of the lack of any medical testimony or written reports concerning the Plaintiff's medical condition or the Defendant's hearing loss and his herniated condition and prostate diagnosis.

This is a marriage of <cross_reference>15-1</cross_reference>/2 years.

This is the second marital union for each party according to the testimony. The Court notes that no health form was filed.

There were no children issue of this union.

There does not appear to be any specific reason for the marital breakdown other than the Plaintiff's disinclination to live in Florida.

The future looks very bleak for both parties, the Plaintiff with Krohns Disease and the Defendant with his prostate condition.
