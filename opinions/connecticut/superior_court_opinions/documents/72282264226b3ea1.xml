<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiffs allege in their Second Revised Complaint that on various dates prior to May 24, 2002 the plaintiff Daris Salinas engaged the defendant Alexander Carrese, M.D. to treat her in his Derby, Connecticut office for conditions relating to her reproductive system, including a fibroid uterus. On May 24, 2002, the defendant performed a total abdominal hysterectomy utilizing blunt dissection technique in separating the bladder from the lower segment of the uterus, in the course of which he injured her bladder causing a vesicovaginal fistula and thereafter in a continuing course of conduct from May 24, 2002 though November 23, 2002 did not diagnose and treat said injury or cause said injury to be diagnosed and treated.

On December 8, 2005, the court (Stevens, J.) entered scheduling orders.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Said orders provide in pertinent part that: "The plaintiff shall disclose expert witnesses, including medical treaters who will be called to testify, by May 19, 2006 . . ." Said orders further provide that jury selection will commence on May 22, 2007.

On April 25, 2006, the defendant moved that this court amend the scheduling order to permit more time for the depositions of both parties.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

On May 2, 2006, the court (Stevens, J.) granted the motion to revise the scheduling order. The amendment did not change the date for the plaintiffs' disclosure of experts, or the date for jury selection to commence.

On September 11, 2006 the defendant filed a motion to modify scheduling order. The defendant states in his motion that: "Plaintiff's counsel has refused to cooperate in resolving scheduling issues for disclosure of plaintiff's experts and notice of plaintiff's IME . . . CT Page 4391 Plaintiff's counsel has <italic>not</italic> disclosed experts in accordance with Connecticut Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>13-4</cross_reference> making it impossible for defense counsel to comply with deadline to notice expert depositions. Plaintiff's counsel refuses to even discuss a deadline for disclosure . . ."

On September 13, 2006 the plaintiffs filed a pleading titled "Plaintiff's Response to Motion to Modify Scheduling Order." The plaintiff states in the response that they are "in agreement with the specific scheduling requests" made by the defendant. The plaintiffs further state that ". . . because the plaintiff Daris Salinas is actively in treatment and currently in the process of undergoing additional tests, the plaintiffs would like to reserve the right to apply to the court for permission to add additional treating experts if future developments warrant such a request . . ."

On September 15, 2006 the plaintiffs filed a pleading titled "Plaintiffs' Further Response De (sic) Motion to Modify Scheduling Order." This pleading provides in pertinent part that: "simply stated, the reservation sought by the plaintiffs merely seeks to be allowed after September 29, 2006 to request leave to notice such further treaters as may become involved in the course of the plaintiff's current and ongoing treatment. The arguments advanced by the defendant in objecting to the reservation can be made on any occasion on which the plaintiffs seek to notice an additional treating expert, and then the matter will be up to the court in the actual circumstances that exist at that time."

On September 25, 2006, the court ordered an immediate status conference. As a result of the conference, the court extended the deadline for the defendants to notice the deposition of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses to October 11, 2006.

On October 4, 2006 the plaintiffs filed a disclosure of expert witnesses.

On October 6, 2006 the defendant filed a Motion to Compel Proper Expert Disclosure. The defendant raised issues concerning the following matters:

1. Other treaters; and

2. The Urology Center, Current Treater: Dr. Mary Grey Maher; and

3. Dr. Dilmer Diaz. CT Page 4392

On October 11, 2006 the court entered an oral scheduling order.

On November 13, 2006 the defendant filed a motion to compel proper expert disclosure.

On December 7, 2006 this court entered the following order: "Compliance is ordered by January 15, 2007. If the moving party has not received compliance by that date, it may file an additional motion attesting to that fact and referencing this order. Upon such additional motion's appearance on the short calendar, and absent the fling of proof of compliance by the time of such appearance, nonsuit will be granted."

On February 9, 2007, the defendant filed the instant motion for Judgment of Dismissal, or Entry of Nonsuit.

The Court will address the issues in the order that they were raised.

<center>                             <italic>Other Treaters</italic></center>
As to "other treaters," the defendant objects to the plaintiffs seeking the right to call as experts other treaters who "`may became involved in the care and treatment of Dana Salinas' and submit that plaintiff's disclosure of these `other treaters' does not comply with Practice Book ยง <cross_reference>13-4</cross_reference>(4) . . ."

Section <cross_reference>13-4</cross_reference>(4) of the Practice Book provides in pertinent part that:

<block_quote>  In addition to and notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (1), (2) and (3) of this rule, any plaintiff expecting to call an expert witness at trial shall disclose the name of that expert, the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion, to all other parties within a reasonable time prior to trial . . .</block_quote>

What this issue comes down to is that the defendant is seeking to have the court prohibit the plaintiff from even filing additional disclosure of expert witnesses. The moving party did not cite, nor could this court find, any authority that would support such a prohibition. As the court stated during oral argument, under the circumstances of this case and in CT Page 4393 light of the pending trial date, it is extremely likely, but not absolutely certain that it would deny any future request by the plaintiffs concerning additional experts testifying about the plaintiff's medical treatment after all there may be a situation that the court has not anticipated that may warrant the granting of such relief; However, it will deal with any such request as and if the situation arises.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> The court recognizes that attorneys have an obligation to zealously represent their clients.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> It therefore will not prohibit an attorney from filing pleadings that he or she believes are necessary, provided that the motions are not of a frivolous nature. That being said, the Court agrees with the defendant that the language concerning reserving a right to call other unnamed treaters is not appropriate in a disclosure of expert witnesses.

<center>      <italic>The Urology Center, Dr. Mary Grey Maher</italic> The defendant argues that the plaintiffs' disclosure of the above referenced individuals is deficient in that it does not state the specific diagnoses, findings, treatment or prognosis. The defendant further argues that it does not have any records from the Urology Center or Dr. Mary Grey Maher. Additionally the defendant argues that the language in the disclosure concerns "current exploration of issues but not a diagnosis or an opinion."</center>
The court agrees with the defendant's position. The disclosure concerning the Urology Center and Mary Grey Maher, M.D., is defective. It does not adequately state the specific diagnoses, findings, treatment or prognosis of the treating expert. Furthermore, it delves into exploration of issues and does not adequately set out a diagnosis or opinion of the treaters.

<center>                             <italic>Dr. Dilmer Diaz</italic></center>
The defendant argues that the disclosure of Dilmer Diaz, M.D. is defective in that it merely contains references to allegations in the complaint and refers to medical records rather than the proposed testimony of the expert as is required by the provisions of ยง <cross_reference>13-4</cross_reference>(4) of the Practice Book. The defendant specifically argues that the "Plaintiffs state `review of records and materials pertaining to Daris Salinas and her treatment' as basis in part for Dr. Diaz opinion." The defendant asserts that whereas the plaintiffs do not indicate what part of the records and materials they are referring to, this statement is too vague and non-descriptive.

CT Page 4394 The court agrees with the defendant's argument. The disclosure is not tailored to the facts alleged in this particular case. With the exception of including the plaintiff's name, the disclosure could apply to anyone about any kind of treatment.

The court notes that the defendant raised a concern about the language used in the disclosure that: "Dr. Diaz will also testify that [the plaintiff's] vesicovaginal fistula was <italic>probably</italic> caused by her hysterectomy . . ." (Emphasis added.) The court agrees that this statement does not meet the requisite standard that the expert witness is of the opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the hysterectomy performed by the defendant was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's vesicovaginal fistula.

<center>                               <italic>Conclusion</italic></center>
For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court shall enforce its order of December 7, 2006 and nonsuit shall enter against the plaintiffs. So ordered.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> See Motion #116.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> Of course the court would give the defendant additional time to deal with the situation in the highly unlikely event that the plaintiff was given permission for an additional expert to testify.</footnote_body>
