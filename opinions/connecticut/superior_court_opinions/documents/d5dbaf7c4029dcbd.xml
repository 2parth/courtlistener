<opinion_byline><unpublished>  DENNIS F. HARRIGAN, JUDGE TRIAL REFEREE.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  The plaintiff wife, 59, whose birth name is Kane, and the defendant husband, 59, married on July 12, 1969 in Norwalk, Connecticut. All the allegations of the amended complaint dated August 17, 2004 are found to be proven and therefore true.

The parties met in September 1968. They became active in supporting the AVM Center operated by Sri Chinmoy as director that was located in Queens, New York. The center provided meditation, civil guidance and support to its members. At the direction of Sri Chinmoy they agreed to marry. The defendant thereafter studied accounting, then attended UConn law school, passed the bar and in 1974 opened an office in Darien, Connecticut concentrating on real estate matters and litigation. Both parties became active in acquiring, improving and then either retaining or selling the parcel. They maintained a joint bank account from 1983 until 2003. The plaintiff volunteered at the Center as did the defendant who provided assistance.

In 1980 a Queens six-unit apartment house located at 148-24 86 Ave. was purchased that underwent extensive renovation during the next 21 years. The plaintiff is the record owner of the property. She and the defendant stipulated that the fair market value is $675,000. He lists $22,000 of liens and fines lodged against it.

The following year the parties acquired 5 Chimnoy Ave., Greenwich, CT., a 3-family house with an office. The plaintiff's appraiser valued it at $820,000 as of July 29, 2005 while the defendant listed it at $920,000 fair market value on his financial affidavit. The plaintiff occupies the ground floor. The court has concluded the value is $850,000. There is no mortgage.

In 1987 2 Chimnoy was built as a 2-unit condominium with 2A being sold. The defendant lists 2B as solely in his name with a value of $550,000 subject to a mortgage balance of $128,000. It consists of 4 CT Page 13823 bedrooms, 3.5 baths for a monthly rental of $3,100 (Pl. Ex. #6). The plaintiff's appraiser found the fair market value as of July 29, 2005 to be $510,000. The court has concluded the value is $500,000 less a mortgage balance of $128,000, net equity is $372,000. There was a Bank One home equity line i.e. mortgage encumbering 2B as of January 21, 2004 (Pl. Ex. #41) and, if still outstanding, is to be paid as set out infra.

He also has an interest in a building in Estonia that he values at $26,000.

He also owns Lot 22, Eugene St., Byram (Greenwich) .16 acre in a R-12 zone that the Town valued at $25,500 in 2001. He notes it is non-buildable and values it at $6,400 but did not submit proof that it cannot be utilized. The court has concluded that the value is $20,000.

He also purchased land in Hawaii that the parties stipulated is currently worth $290,000 subject to $128,000 mortgage balance, a net equity of $162,000.

The defendant sold a parcel located in the Belle Haven section of Greenwich, CT. and known as 5 Meadow Wood Drive on June 18, 2004 (Pl. Ex. #22). The net proceeds of $1,610,209 (Pl. Ex. 24) are being held in escrow. The court finds that the parties' money was applied to the said property. Both parties are claiming a share of the escrow. The plaintiff's proposed orders are silent as to tax liability while the defendant's proposed order requests that $200,000 continue to be held until the taxes on the transaction have been paid. The 2004 return is not yet filed. The court finds that the resolution of the tax liabilities to IRS and this state is necessary to prevent the other orders entered as part of the judgment from being undermined. The stipulation filed with the court wherein the plaintiff agreed to the sale and escrow does not address the tax consequences (106). There was scant evidence offered during the trial on this issue. The court finds that <italic>Roberts v. Roberts,</italic> <cross_reference>32 Conn.App. 465</cross_reference>
applies to the completion of the liquidation of real property initially covered by the automatic orders.

The defendant has a 25% interest in his mother's home, occupied by her, valued at $45,000.

The defendant with two others formed Sinawoy Farms, LLC to develop .844 acres of land on Sinawoy Road, Cos Cob, Greenwich, CT (De. Ex. I) for which was purchased in February 2003 for $916,000 (Pl. Ex. #6). On March 23, 2005 the Land Use Department of the Planning and Zoning Commission issued a finding that the parcel contained two lots that met minimum area and frontage requirements of the zone and did not need subdivision or CT Page 13824 resubdivision (Pl. Ex. #10). Another of the members of the LLC died and on May 30, 2005 the co-administrators submitted an inventory to the Greenwich Probate Court stating that "2/3 interest" in the LLC was valued at $76,667 (Pl. Ex. #7). On July 12, 2005 the plaintiff's appraiser found fair market value to be $1,440,000 (Pl. Ex. #8). The defendant lists the value of his interest in Sinawoy at $100,000 on his financial affidavit. The court finds the fair market value of the parcel to be $1,410,000 with defendant's interest worth $470,000.

The plaintiff is a teacher grossing $2,438.36 monthly as well as netting $2,425 from rents collected from the Chinmoy parcels. The defendant lists nil income from his law practice in 2005 to the time of trial. For 2003 he listed $12,993 net profit from the law practice, rental income of $30,953 and net profit from R.T. Medical Technologies of $1,682 on his 1040 Form U.S. income tax return (De. Ex. P).

The plaintiff lists about $3,000 in other assets including an auto and two credit card debts totaling $13,550. The defendant has listed cash $1,785; Raymond James brokerage account $74,000; Clinical Instruments stock $20,000; R.T. Medical Catheter Company, located in Estonia, $1,000; two autos $900 and misc. $400. As liabilities he lists $200,000 tax liabilities for the sale of Belle Haven; Visa $4,500; Home Depot $4,000 and $14,000 due his attorney.

The parties spent over twenty years participating in the activities of the Center as "obedient disciples" until the defendant withdrew in 2003. After he resigned he ". . . realized that I didn't have to be married anymore . . ." and decided to leave the marriage. The court finds it unnecessary to further detail the breakdown of the marriage. The parties separated in November 2003. The defendant bears the responsibility as the cause of the marriage breakdown.

The court finds that the defendant has the greater earning capacity, the greater ability to acquire assets in the future, good health, entrepreneurial talent, is an experienced lawyer as well as in developing and managing real property (Pl. Ex. # 27).

The court summarizes the parties' assets as follows:
