<opinion_text><unpublished><center>                       MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</center>
The motion for summary judgment presently before the court arises in a collection action in which the plaintiff, New Britain General Hospital, seeks to collect $8676.15 for services rendered to the defendant, Joseph Harris. The defendant, who appears pro se, has failed to file a pleading.

The plaintiff filed its motion for summary judgment and memorandum of law in support on October 26, 2004. The plaintiff claims that there are no genuine issues of material fact and no questions of law, and, therefore, summary judgment should be granted in its favor. The plaintiff has also submitted an affidavit of debt executed by its legal assistant Corey W. Cass, the averments of which track the allegations of the complaint. Cass avers that the plaintiff rendered medical services to the defendant and that "[t]here is currently due the sum of $8676.15 in principal damages, the reasonable value of said services, plus interest and costs of suit all of which the defendant(s) has failed and/or refused to pay despite demand." The plaintiff has also submitted copies of itemized billing statements for services rendered to the defendant on or about August 23, 2001 through March 25, 2003. The defendant has filed nothing in opposition to the plaintiff's motion.

"The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law . . . and the party opposing such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact."

Because the balance due on Harris's account is undisputed, New Britain Hospital has met its burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material facts. Harris has not opposed New Britain Hospital's motion for summary judgment and has not produced any evidence establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. For the reasons stated, New Britain Hospital's motion for summary judgment is granted in the amount of $8676.15 plus costs. So ordered.
