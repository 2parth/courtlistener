Convicted of the crime of aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser offense included in the crime of aiding and abetting murder, the defendant appealed to this court claiming that because the crime of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm was not a lesser offense included in the crime of murder, his conviction could not stand. <italic>Held</italic> that because it was not possible to commit the greater offense — murder — in the manner described in the information and the bill of particulars without first having committed manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm was a lesser offense included in the crime of aiding and abetting murder; because the allegations of the information and the bill of particulars on the charge of murder stated that the defendant and<page_number>Page 764</page_number>
another person shot the victim by means of a deadly weapon and because, as defined by statute (§ <cross_reference>53a-3</cross_reference> [19]), a firearm is the only deadly weapon capable of shooting, the defendant was on notice of the charges against him.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>   The defendant, Edward Ferreira, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>53a-8</cross_reference> (a)<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> and <cross_reference>53a-55a</cross_reference>
(a).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The defendant's sole<page_number>Page 765</page_number>
claim on appeal is that it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury that the crime of aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is a lesser included offense of aiding and abetting a murder when the information fails to allege the use of a firearm in the commission of the murder.

The following procedural history is relevant to the resolution of this issue. The state charged the defendant in a substitute information with murder in violation of General Statutes §<cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference> (a), aiding and abetting murder in violation of General Statutes §§ 53-8 (a) and <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference> (a), felony murder in violation of General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-54c</cross_reference>, conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>53a-48</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference>
(a) and aiding and abetting burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>53a-8</cross_reference> (a) and <cross_reference>53a-101</cross_reference> (a) (1). On March 24, 1997, prior to trial, the state filed a supplemental bill of particulars, which indicated the manner in which the crimes were allegedly committed.

The trial court instructed the jury that it could consider whether the defendant was guilty of any of four lesser included offenses, including aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of §§ <cross_reference>53a-8</cross_reference> (a) and <cross_reference>53a-55a</cross_reference>
(a). The defendant did not object to the trial court's instruction on this lesser included offense. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on all of the charges in the substitute information, and guilty on the lesser included offense of aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm.

The defendant argues that the information charged him with two alternative counts of murder but did not mention that a firearm was used in the commission of the murder. Citing <italic>State</italic> v.<italic>Guess</italic>, <cross_reference>39 Conn. App. 224</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>665 A.2d 126</cross_reference>, cert. denied,<cross_reference>235 Conn. 924</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>666 A.2d 1187</cross_reference><page_number>Page 766</page_number>
(1995), and <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Falcon</italic>, <cross_reference>26 Conn. App. 259</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>600 A.2d 1364</cross_reference> (1991), cert. denied, <cross_reference>221 Conn. 911</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>602 A.2d 10</cross_reference> (1992), the defendant further argues that, under these circumstances, it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury that it could consider aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser included offense of murder. The state responds that the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the lesser included offense of aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm because the bill of particulars specifically alleged that the defendant and his accomplices shot and killed the victim with a deadly weapon. We agree with the state.

As a threshold matter, we note that the defendant did not raise this issue at trial and now seeks review under either the plain error doctrine<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> or <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Golding</italic>,<cross_reference>213 Conn. 233</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>239-40</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>567 A.2d 823</cross_reference> (1989).<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> We<page_number>Page 767</page_number>
will review this claim under <italic>Golding</italic> because the record is adequate for review and "[t]he lesser included offense doctrine implicates notice requirements of due process." <italic>State</italic> v.<italic>Falcon</italic>, supra, <cross_reference>26 Conn. App. 264</cross_reference>. The defendant's claim fails under the third prong of <italic>Golding</italic>, however, because the alleged constitutional violation did not clearly exist and did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial.

A criminal defendant has a constitutional right "to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to meet them at trial." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Spigarolo</italic>,<cross_reference>210 Conn. 359</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>381</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>556 A.2d 112</cross_reference>, cert. denied, <cross_reference>493 U.S. 933</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>110 S.Ct. 322</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>107 L.Ed.2d 312</cross_reference> (1989). The state satisfies this constitutional mandate when its pleadings inform "the defendant of the charge[s] against him with sufficient precision to enable him to prepare his defense and to avoid prejudicial surprise, and [are] definite enough to enable him to plead his acquittal or conviction in bar of any future prosecution for the same offense. . . ." (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. "Where one or more offenses are lesser than and included in the crime charged in the information, notice of the crime charged includes notice of all lesser included offenses. . . . The test for determining whether one crime is a lesser included offense of another crime is whether it is possible to commit the greater offense in the manner described in the information <italic>or bill of</italic><italic>particulars</italic> without having first committed the lesser." (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Falcon</italic>, supra, <cross_reference>26 Conn. App. 264</cross_reference>.

This court has held that a defendant cannot be lawfully convicted of manslaughter in the first degree with<page_number>Page 768</page_number>
a firearm as a lesser included offense of murder when there is no allegation that the defendant committed the murder by the use of a firearm. See <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Guess</italic>, supra, <cross_reference>39 Conn. App. 238</cross_reference>. This is because the crime of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm would require proof of an additional element, namely the use of a firearm, that is not a necessary element to the crime of murder as alleged; see <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Falcon</italic>, supra,<cross_reference>26 Conn. App. 265</cross_reference>-66; and, therefore, it would be possible to commit the greater offense without having first committed the lesser.

The defendant argues that in <italic>Falcon</italic> and <italic>Guess</italic>, "this court considered the identical issue raised here, finding that the offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is not a lesser included offense of murder when the information fails to allege that a firearm was used in the commission of the murder." In both of the cases cited there was no allegation in the information that a firearm was used in the commission of the crime. Neither case, however, discussed a bill of particulars. In<italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Guess</italic>, supra, <cross_reference>39 Conn. App. 237</cross_reference>, the state urged this court to consider other counts in the information, which referred to the use of a handgun, and to the probable cause hearing to supply the missing element, namely, the use of a handgun. This court declined to do so. In <italic>State</italic> v. <italic>Falcon</italic>, supra, <cross_reference>26 Conn. App. 266</cross_reference>, this court held that "it is simply irrelevant that the evidence adduced at trial could have supported the additional element of use of a firearm."

In this case, the state is asking this court to consider the information and the bill of particulars together in determining whether there was an allegation that the defendant committed the murder by means of a firearm. We have held that it is appropriate for this court to "look at the statutes, the information and the<italic>bill of particulars</italic> . . . to determine what constitutes a lesser included offense of the offense charged."<page_number>Page 769</page_number>
(Emphasis added.) Id. We must decide, therefore, whether it is possible to commit murder, in the manner described in the information <italic>and the bill of particulars</italic>, without first having committed manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm.

The state charged the defendant in a substitute information with, inter alia, aiding and abetting murder in violation of General Statutes §§ <cross_reference>53a-8</cross_reference> (a) and <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference> (a). On March 24, 1997, prior to trial, the state filed a supplemental bill of particulars.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> The bill of particulars alleged that the defendant committed the charged offenses in the following manner: "The defendant, accompanied by two others, agreed to go to 66-68 York Street, Waterbury, Connecticut <italic>to kill Donald</italic><italic>Bedard by</italic> <italic>means of a deadly weapon</italic>. . . . The defendant and at least one other person went into 66-68 York Street and <italic>shot and</italic><italic>killed Donald Bedard</italic> and removed a box which contained money." (Emphasis added.) Count two of the substitute information provided that the defendant "did commit the crime of murder in violation of [General Statutes] §§ <cross_reference>53a-8</cross_reference> (a) and <cross_reference>53a-54a</cross_reference> (a) in that on or about January 21, 1996, at or about 9 a.m., at or near 66-68 York Street, Waterbury, [Connecticut], the said [defendant] acting with the intent to cause the death of another person, solicited and intentionally aided another person to cause the death of another person, to wit: Donald Bedard." The defendant, therefore, was given notice through the information and the bill of particulars that<page_number>Page 770</page_number>
he was charged with the crime of aiding and abetting murder, and that it was alleged that he and his associates shot and killed the victim by means of a deadly weapon.

Section <cross_reference>53a-55a</cross_reference> (a) provides that "[a] person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm when he commits manslaughter in the first degree as provided in section <cross_reference>53a-55</cross_reference>, and in the commission of such offense he uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of or displays or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses a pistol, revolver, shotgun, machine gun, rifle or other firearm. . . ." A firearm is defined as "any sawed-off shotgun, machine gun, rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or other weapon, whether loaded or unloaded from which a shot may be discharged. . . ." General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-3</cross_reference> (19). General Statutes § <cross_reference>53a-3</cross_reference> (6) defines a deadly weapon as "any weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, from which a shot may be discharged, or a switchblade knife, gravity knife, billy, blackjack, bludgeon, or metal knuckles. . . ."

Because the statutory definitions of firearm and deadly weapon both include a weapon from which a shot may be discharged and because a firearm is the only deadly weapon, as defined in the statutes, which is capable of shooting, it is impossible to commit murder in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars without having committed manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. We conclude, therefore, that the notice contained in the bill of particulars and the information was adequate to inform the defendant that a firearm was used in the commission of the murder. The trial court, therefore, properly instructed the jury that aiding and abetting manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm is a lesser included offense of aiding and abetting murder.
