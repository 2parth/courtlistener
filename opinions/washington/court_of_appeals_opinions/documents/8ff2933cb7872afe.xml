<opinion_text><unpublished>  Jesus Gonzalez-Quezada challenges his jury conviction for delivery of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He argues that the trial court erred in repeatedly denying his timely, unequivocal requests to proceed pro se. Because Gonzalez's requests were equivocal and his additional assignments of error are without merit, we affirm his conviction.

<center>                                  <italic>FACTS</italic></center>
The State charged Jesus Gonzalez-Quezada (Gonzalez) in two separate cases. King County No. 06-1-054853 involved charges for stolen property, driving under the influence, and hit and run (stolen property case). The case at issue here, King County No. 06-1-05995-2, involved cocaine delivery (drug case). Gonzalez sold $20 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer.

On June 29, 2006, Gonzalez appeared at a case scheduling hearing in the <italic>stolen property</italic> case.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Gonzalez's counsel informed the court that Gonzalez wished to proceed pro se. The court asked Gonzalez, "You want to be your own lawyer?" Gonzalez replied, "Yeah, because, uh, I had already, I had already found out [my attorney] was working for the prosecution but if you can give me an attorney I can trust, yeah, I can try one, another one but he was lying [too] much and railroading me." After asking Gonzalez a few questions, the court denied the request for self-representation but agreed to reconsider if Gonzalez "decides he wants to represent himself and is prepared to listen to my questions and answers."

On July 18, 2006, Gonzalez appeared at a case scheduling hearing in the <italic>drug</italic> case. Gonzalez requested to represent himself. The court did not rule on the request at that time. The parties agreed to schedule the motion to proceed pro se three days later, on July 21, 2006. At the July 21, 2006 hearing on the motion to proceed pro se involving both the<italic>stolen property</italic> case and the <italic>drug</italic> case, the following colloquy with Gonzalez occurred:

<block_quote>  [The Court]: So you realize . . . sir that you'd be facing some fairly significant time . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yeah, that why, that's why I'm going to study about the points because he lie on me. He say I got one point then later he come back and say I got eight points so I started disagreeing with that so I got to find and research it for myself.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Okay, well a lot of times you wind up, especially if it's out of state convictions or federal court convictions you wind up with you can't tell how many points you have unless you get a hearing before a judge and it's finally resolved. Do you understand that?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yes Your Honor that's why I want it resolved . . . because he, he's been giving me confusing statements. From one point he jumped to eight points, I don't know what happened what was the purpose of lying.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Are you familiar with the . . . Washington State Rules of Evidence?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: No, but I'm gonna study. I need the access to a law library so I can research it for myself.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Are you familiar with the Rules of Criminal Procedure[]?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yeah.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: How did you become familiar with the Washington State Rules of Criminal Procedure?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Nothing, but I've been in California already and, and I read some of the same.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Excuse me. Do you understand that if you take the stand and testify in this case that you would have to ask yourself questions?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yeah.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: And you can't proceed in narrative form?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yeah.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: And now I understand you're not happy with Mr. Warner and you made and earlier motion to . . . have Mr. Warner replaced?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yeah.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: . . . . Would you prefer to have another attorney appointed for you or would you prefer to represent yourself?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: I don't think a public defender would defend me cause there's a conflict of interest. They want to try to cover up their conspiracy. So I don't have no other choice but representing myself.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: And what . . . conspiracy would that be?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Because like you say from one point it came to eight points what was the purpose of lying? Why did he say like I was (unintelligible) from between two and six months?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Well if you don't trust Mr. Warner why is it that you wouldn't trust another defense attorney?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: On this because they would, they cover up their, they cover up their behavior, each other because they got to protect their interest.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Where'd you get that information?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Because I mean I've been dealing with a lot of public defender[s] before. So I already know how they operate.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Well let me suggest to you sir that I've been dealing with public defenders for a lot longer than you have and a lot more hours per day and my experience is precisely the opposite.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: We can try a new (unintelligible), someone to can really tell me the true. Don't be lying.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: All right.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: And, yeah, we can try, yeah, we can try and if it doesn't work then I will represent myself. Okay, so I don't think they, they, they gonna try to protect they, what he did, the lying.</block_quote>

Based on Gonzalez's agreement to try another attorney, the court denied the motion to proceed pro se, discharged his counsel, and authorized appointment of new counsel. He was assigned the same counsel in both the stolen property case and the drug case.

A week later, on July 28, the parties appeared before the court to jointly move for a trial continuance in the <italic>stolen</italic><italic>property</italic> case. The following exchange occurred:

<block_quote>  [The State]: I-05485-3 Seattle designation. Charles Newton appearing on behalf of the State. I am standing in for the assigned prosecutor Patrick Hines. The defendant is present in custody represented by new counsel Justin Wolfe. Your Honor this case was Omnibus before you last week for the first time. It was rolled to today, uh, the defendant brought a motion to proceed Pro Se last week. You denied that motion uh, but you allowed defense counsel to withdraw and direct an OPD [Office of Public Defense] to appoint counsel from another agency. Uh, it was rolled to today new counsel Mr. Wolfe has been appointed. Uh, at this point the state would . . . my understanding is that new counsel was provided discovery this morning by a previous counsel Richard Warner from TDA [The Defender Association]. Uh, I was instructed to also inform counsel that we are . . . the State is intending to add Driving While Under the Influence and Hit and Run charges in the case. In addition to that, we are uh, there's a joint motion to continue at this time. Mr. Wolfe . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Defense]: Uh . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The State]: Maybe I'll . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Defense]: I need to inform the court something. Your Honor, as counsel stated I've just received discovery this morning. I did have an opportunity to speak with Mr. Gonzalez-Quezada prior to today uh, I indicated to him that there was (unintelligible) no way that we would be prepared to go to trial on the date as set. We're just receiving discovery today, uh when I spoke to Mr. Gonzalez-Quezada regarding that he was adamant about not voluntarily waiving his right to a speedy trial. He also has indicated to me that if a motion is brought by me to continue the matter that he would wish to renew his motion to proceed Pro Se.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Okay, in your professional opinion do you need more time to adequately prepare and adequately defend him?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Defense]: Yes, Your Honor.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Alright, okay. Do you want to say anything sir?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Ah, yes, he cannot represent me because we're gonna start trial next week. So, I gotta represent myself, I don't got no other choice.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: (unintelligible) right.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: Yeah, true.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: I find good cause for (unintelligible) . . . I don't think the defendant is in any shape to defend himself. (unintelligible) new counsel has been appointed for him and . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: That's another view by . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Any counsel who took this case or any Pro Se defendant who attempted to represent himself without adequate discovery investigation would uh, in the case of a lawyer be committing malpractice and in the case of a defendant would be putting on an ineffective defense. And I'm going to deny the defendant the right to uh . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: . . . effective defense</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Gonzalez]: There's too many regulations already. Too many (unintelligible) violations, I have rights so I want my right to Pro Se.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: That's fine, you just state what you want. I'll sign the appropriate order.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [Defense]: I'll need to prepare orders Your Honor.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  [The Court]: Alright thank you.</block_quote>

Eventually, Gonzalez was permitted to proceed pro se in the<italic>stolen property</italic> case. He was convicted as charged.<italic>State v. Gonzalez-Quezada</italic>, noted at <cross_reference>145 Wn. App. 1002</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>2008 WL 2332599</cross_reference>.

On August 11, defense counsel and the State both moved to continue the <italic>drug</italic> case. Defense counsel said that Gonzalez no longer wished to proceed pro se but did want to discharge him as counsel. Gonzalez was present and did not contest this statement. The trial court denied the motion to substitute counsel but granted the continuance. Gonzalez proceeded to trial with defense counsel in the drug case and was convicted of delivery of cocaine. The court imposed a standard range 90-month sentence.

Gonzalez subsequently moved for a new trial or postconviction relief in the drug case, arguing the court denied him his right to self-representation and other grounds. The court denied his motion.

<center>                                <italic>ANALYSIS</italic></center>
Gonzalez argues that the trial court improperly denied his timely, unequivocal request to proceed pro se. He asserts that he made four requests to proceed pro se, on June 29, July 18, July 21, and July 28. And in particular, his July 28 request was unequivocal. Further, the trial court denied this request on the improper basis that he would put on an ineffective defense. He also argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the same basis.

The State counters that Gonzalez never made an unequivocal demand to represent himself. The State argues further that even if Gonzalez made such an unequivocal demand at the July 28 hearing, that hearing involved the stolen property case, not the drug case at issue here. The State also argues that even if the trial court abused its discretion by denying Gonzalez's right to self-representation, he relinquished that right by later agreeing to be represented by counsel.

We review a trial court's denial of a defendant's motion for pro se status under an abuse of discretion standard. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Madsen</italic>, <cross_reference>168 Wn.2d 496</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>504</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>229 P.3d 714</cross_reference> (2010).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

Criminal defendants have an explicit right to self-representation under the Washington Constitution and an implicit right under the

<cross_reference>Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution</cross_reference>. Wash. Const. art. <cross_reference>I</cross_reference>, §§ <cross_reference>22</cross_reference> ("the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person"); <italic>Faretta v. California</italic>,<cross_reference>422 U.S. 806</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>819</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>95 S. Ct. 2525</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>45 L. Ed. 2d 562</cross_reference> (1975). This right is so fundamental that it is afforded despite its potentially detrimental impact on both the defendant and the administration of justice. <italic>Faretta</italic>, <cross_reference>422 U.S. at 834</cross_reference>;<italic>State v. Vermillion</italic>, <cross_reference>112 Wn. App. 844</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>51 P.3d 188</cross_reference>
(2002). "The unjustified denial of this [pro se] right requires reversal." <italic>State v. Stenson</italic>, <cross_reference>132 Wn.2d 668</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>737</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>940 P.2d 1239</cross_reference> (1997). However, both the United States Supreme Court and this court have held that courts are required to indulge in "`every reasonable presumption' against a defendant's waiver of his or her right to counsel." <italic>In re Det. of Turay</italic>,<cross_reference>139 Wn.2d 379</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>396</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>986 P.2d 790</cross_reference> (1999) (quoting <italic>Brewer v.</italic><italic>Williams</italic>, <cross_reference>430 U.S. 387</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>404</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97 S. Ct. 1232</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>51 L. Ed. 2d 424</cross_reference> (1977)).

The right to proceed pro se is neither absolute nor self-executing. <italic>State v. Woods</italic>, <cross_reference>143 Wn.2d 561</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>586</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>23 P.3d 1046</cross_reference> (2001). When a defendant requests pro se status, the trial court must determine whether the request is unequivocal and timely. <italic>Stenson</italic>, <cross_reference>132 Wn.2d at 737</cross_reference>. Absent a finding that the request was equivocal or untimely, the court must then determine if the defendant's request is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, usually by colloquy. <italic>Faretta</italic>,<cross_reference>422 U.S. at 835</cross_reference>; <italic>State v. Stegall</italic>, <cross_reference>124 Wn.2d 719</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>881 P.2d 979</cross_reference>
(1994). Even if a request is unequivocal, timely, voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, a court may defer ruling if the court is reasonably unprepared to immediately respond to the request.<italic>State v. Madsen</italic>, <cross_reference>168 Wn.2d 496</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>504</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>229 P.3d 714</cross_reference>
(2010).

Here, the trial court did not err. During the June 29 scheduling conference on the stolen property case and the July 18 hearing on the drug case, the court delayed a decision on the motions for self-representation until a July 21 hearing. The June 29 hearing did not involve this case, and regardless, these decisions were well within the court's discretion to control its calendar. As our Supreme Court recently observed, a court may defer a ruling until it is reasonably prepared to respond to the request. <italic>Madsen</italic>, <cross_reference>168 Wn.2d at 504</cross_reference>.

At the July 21 hearing, the court correctly noted that Gonzalez had previously requested both a new attorney and the right to proceed pro se. By the hearing's end, Gonzalez agreed with the trial court that it would be preferable to proceed with a new attorney.

The July 28 hearing did not involve this case. The prosecutor referenced only the case number for the stolen property case. Furthermore, the parties discussed whether the trial in that case could go forward the following week. Gonzalez's pro se request was tied to his counsel's statement to the court that counsel needed more time to prepare. This demonstrates that the case under discussion was the stolen property case, not the drug case. Therefore, any denial in that hearing applied to a case not presently before this court. And as this court previously held in <italic>Gonzalez-Quezada</italic>, <cross_reference>2008 WL 2332559</cross_reference>, Gonzalez was eventually allowed to proceed pro se in that case and therefore he was not denied his constitutional right.

Our review of the record shows July 21 was the last time Gonzalez requested to proceed pro se in the drug case at issue here. And this was the date specifically set for the motion to proceed pro se.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Gonzalez correctly argues that the mere fact that his pro se request was paired with an alternative remedy to substitute counsel did not itself render the request equivocal. <italic>Madsen</italic>, <cross_reference>168 Wn.2d at 507</cross_reference>. But pairing such alternative requests may be an indication to the trial court that, in light of the whole record, the pro se request is not unequivocal. <italic>State v. Stenson</italic>, <cross_reference>132 Wn.2d 668</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>740-41</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>940 P.2d 1239</cross_reference> (1997). Because Gonzalez had previously made both requests, the trial court correctly asked him if he would prefer new counsel or prefer pro se representation. By the proceeding's end, Gonzalez agreed that he should try new counsel. In essence, he withdrew his pro se request and decided to proceed with substitute counsel.

Gonzalez argues that his agreement to try new counsel rather than proceed pro se was contingent and that the July 28 hearing makes clear that the new counsel did not work out. But this argument is undermined by several undisputed facts — (1) the July 28 hearing involved a different case, (2) the pro se request in the July 28 hearing was tied to his attorney's inability to prepare for a stolen property trial the following week when he had just received discovery that day, and (3) Gonzalez did not make a request to proceed pro se in his next hearing on August 11 in the drug case. We conclude that because Gonzalez never made an unequivocal demand for self-representation in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.

<center>                     <italic>Statement of Additional Grounds</italic></center>
In his statement of additional grounds, Gonzalez essentially raises seven arguments.

First, he challenges the evidence as both false and insufficient. He alleges that police officers offered false testimony and that scientific testimony regarding the cocaine used unreliable scientific methods. The jury was entitled to determine the officers' credibility, and credibility determinations cannot be reviewed on appeal. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Camarillo</italic>, <cross_reference>115 Wn.2d 60</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>71</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>794 P.2d 850</cross_reference> (1990). The record does not support that the prosecutor knowingly offered false evidence. The admission of scientific testimony regarding the cocaine was within the trial court's discretion. The evidence was sufficient because a "`rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'" <italic>State v. Green</italic>, <cross_reference>94 Wn.2d 216</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>221</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>616 P.2d 628</cross_reference> (1980) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <italic>Jackson v.</italic><italic>Virginia</italic>, <cross_reference>443 U.S. 307</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>319</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>99 S. Ct. 2781</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>61 L. Ed. 2d 560</cross_reference> (1979)).

Second, Gonzalez argues that various members involved in the legal process, including judges, his attorneys, courts clerks, and prosecutors, have committed malfeasance and/or engaged in conspiracy. Gonzalez asserts that his defense attorneys were really working for the prosecution, that the trial judge did not read or thoroughly consider the motions he filed, and that clerks or others tampered with transcripts. He also argues that the trial court violated the appearance of fairness doctrine. Under the appearance of fairness doctrine, a judicial proceeding is valid only if a reasonable person, who knows and understands all the relevant facts, would conclude that the parties received a fair, impartial, and neutral hearing. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Gamble</italic>, <cross_reference>168 Wn.2d 161</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>187</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>225 P.3d 973</cross_reference> (2010). Gonzalez has pointed to no facts suggesting impropriety by any of these actors. We therefore reject this argument.

Third, Gonzalez argues that he was denied a right to appeal because the court initially rejected his notice of appeal filings as deficient. This argument is moot because we now consider his appeal.

Fourth, Gonzalez essentially argues ineffective assistance of counsel, citing different tactics his attorney should have used. But legitimate strategic choices by defense counsel do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Rainey</italic>, <cross_reference>107 Wn. App. 129</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>135-36</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>28 P.3d 10</cross_reference> (2001).

Fifth, Gonzalez argued that he should not have been sentenced in absentia. But he was present for his sentencing.

Sixth, Gonzalez argues that newly discovered evidence entitles him to a new trial. But he does not say what this newly discovered evidence is.

Lastly, he argues that he was denied the right to represent himself at trial. This contention is discussed above.

<center>                               <italic>CONCLUSION</italic></center>
The record shows only two hearings related to his self-representation claim in this appeal. In the first, the court delayed a hearing on his self-representation motion for three days. In the second, the court asked Gonzalez whether he wanted self-representation or a new attorney. He chose a new attorney. Accordingly, Gonzalez was not denied his right to self-representation. We affirm his cocaine delivery conviction.
