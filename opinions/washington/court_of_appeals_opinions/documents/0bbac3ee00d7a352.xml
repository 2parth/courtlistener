</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Glenn Umlas appeals the sentence imposed following his conviction for second degree robbery, arguing that his rights to due process and a trial by jury were violated by the inclusion of prior juvenile convictions in his offender score. His arguments were rejected in, and are controlled by, our decision in State v. Weber, Wn. App., 112 P.3d 1287 (2005). See also State v. Tai N., Wn. App., <cross_reference>113 P.3d 19</cross_reference> (2005).

Affirmed.
