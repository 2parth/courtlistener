</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Robert Dermates filed this personal restraint petition challenging, among other things, a sentencing condition that he "not possess or access pornographic materials, as directed by the supervising Community Corrections Officer."<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The State's concession that the condition is unconstitutionally vague is well taken. See State v. Bahl, <cross_reference>164 Wn.2d 739</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>193 P.3d 678</cross_reference> (2008).

Accordingly, we accept the State's concession and grant the personal restraint petition. The matter is remanded to the trial court for amendment of the judgment and sentence consistent with Bahl, <cross_reference>164 Wn.2d at 758-62</cross_reference>.

Remanded.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The Acting Chief Judge previously dismissed Dermates' remaining claims as frivolous.</footnote_body>
