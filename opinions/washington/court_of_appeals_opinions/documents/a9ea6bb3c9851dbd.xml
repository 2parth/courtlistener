<opinion_text>  ¶1  The Western Washington Growth Management Board (Board) invalidated Clallam County's preexisting agricultural uses exemption from the County's critical areas ordinance. The superior court reversed the Board. Protect the Peninsula's Future appeals that ruling, arguing that the Growth Management Act, chapter <cross_reference>36.70A</cross_reference> RCW, permits reasonable regulation of such uses and that the superior court erred in finding that substantial evidence did not support the Board's decision. We reverse the trial court and remand to the Board.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>  ¶2  On December 28, 1999, Clallam County (County) adopted Critical Areas Ordinance (CAO) No. 681, codified at chapter 27.12 of the Clallam County Code. Protect the Peninsula's Future (PPF) and the Washington Environmental Council challenged portions of the ordinance before the Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board. The Board found that Clallam County Code (CCC) 27.12.035(7), the subject of this appeal, substantially interfered with the Growth Management Act (GMA) goals. CCC 27.12.035(7) created an exemption from the critical areas ordinance for ongoing, preexisting agricultural uses in critical areas or their buffers.

  ¶3  The Board concluded that the County could not completely exempt ongoing agricultural uses from the GMA regulation because such uses significantly impacted the<page_number>Page 130</page_number>
environment. The Board also concluded that balancing the GMA's goals and requirements could be done only for designated agricultural resource lands,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> not for all agriculture.

  ¶4  The Board found that CCC 27.12.035(7)'s exemption for existing agricultural activities was not limited to agricultural resource areas, was written too broadly, failed to protect critical areas, and did not comply with the GMA. It further found that the provisions of CCC 27.12.035(7), allowing existing and ongoing agricultural activities within the buffers established for major new development or within 50 feet of Type 5 waters, substantially interferes with the GMA's goals to protect the environment and shorelines. <italic>See</italic>
RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>(10), .480; RCW <cross_reference>90.58.020</cross_reference>. The buffers for major new development ranged from 150 feet to 50 feet for Type 1 through Type 4 streams.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

  ¶5  On remand, the County limited CCC 27.12.035(7)'s agriculture exemption to lands classified as farm and agricultural land in the open space tax program created by chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference> RCW and required that all activities on the land comply with best management practices. The amended ordinance exempted:

<block_quote>  Existing and ongoing agriculture that was conducted prior to the effective date of this chapter on lands designated as critical areas or their associated buffers; provided, that such lands are classified as farm and agricultural land pursuant to Chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference>
RCW; provided further, that all activities occurring on such lands employ best management practices (BMPs). For the purposes of this exemption, acceptable BMPs shall include: (a) activities carried out consistent with farm plans issued and authorized by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); (b) activities that demonstrate consistency with total maximum daily loads (TMDL) established by the Department<page_number>Page 131</page_number>
of Ecology for specific operations; and/or (c) activities that demonstrate consistency with standard BMPs published by the NRCS, as now or hereafter amended. Written confirmation by the administrating agency that applicable BMPs are being met will constitute evidence of eligibility for this exemption.</block_quote>

CCC 27.12.035(7).

  ¶6  On October 26, 2001, the Board ruled that the amended exemption still did not comply with the GMA. It found that reducing protection for critical areas solely because the areas qualified for open space taxation did not balance agricultural goals with critical area goals. The Board concluded that reducing the critical area protection for all properties enrolled in the open space taxation program (chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference>
RCW) substantially interferes with Goal 10 of the GMA (protecting the environment and enhancing water quality and availability) and was not appropriately balanced by consideration of Goal 8 (maintaining and enhancing agriculture).

  ¶7  The County appealed the Board's decision to Clallam County Superior Court. The court reversed the Board, concluding that it had "erroneously interpreted and applied the GMA and its decision was not supported by evidence that is substantial when reviewed in light of the whole record before the Court." Clerk's Papers at 7. PPF appeals only the agricultural exemption issue.

<center>                                ANALYSIS</center><center>                      I. PPF's Procedural Arguments</center>  ¶8  PPF argues that the County's issues are barred by res judicata, collateral estoppel, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. PPF reasons that the Board decided in January 2001 that the County's agriculture exemption to critical areas did not comply with the GMA. The County did not appeal this decision, but reworked the ordinance. Thus, according to PPF, the County's present appeal is barred. Further, PPF argues that the County did<page_number>Page 132</page_number>
not exhaust its administrative remedies because it failed to raise this issue of whether the GMA mandate to protect critical areas requires regulation of preexisting uses that harm these areas. The County responds that res judicata and collateral estoppel do not apply because this appeal is part of an ongoing proceeding and that it exhausted its administrative remedies.

  ¶9  Res judicata, or claim preclusion, applies to quasi-judicial administrative agency decisions. <italic>Lejeune v.</italic><italic>Clallam County</italic>, <cross_reference>64 Wn. App. 257</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>264-65</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>823 P.2d 1144</cross_reference>
(1992) (citing <italic>State v. Dupard</italic>, <cross_reference>93 Wn.2d 268</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>274</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>609 P.2d 961</cross_reference> (1980)). Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, also applies to these decisions. <italic>Christensen v. Grant</italic><italic>County Hosp. Dist. No. 1</italic>, <cross_reference>152 Wn.2d 299</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>307</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>96 P.3d 957</cross_reference>
(2004). Claim preclusion bars a party from asserting the same claim or cause of action in a subsequent proceeding.<italic>Hilltop Terrace Homeowner's Ass'n v. Island County</italic>,<cross_reference>126 Wn.2d 22</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>31</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>891 P.2d 29</cross_reference> (1995). Issue preclusion bars relitigation of an issue in a subsequent proceeding involving the same parties, even if a different cause of action is asserted. <italic>Christensen</italic>, <cross_reference>152 Wn.2d at 306</cross_reference> (citing 14A KARL B. TEGLAND, WASHINGTON PRACTICE: CIVIL PROCEDURE § 35.32, at 475 (1st ed. 2003)).

  ¶10  A party must exhaust its administrative remedies before appealing to superior court. <italic>Citizens for Mount</italic><italic>Vernon v. City of Mount Vernon</italic>, <cross_reference>133 Wn.2d 861</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>866</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>947 P.2d 1208</cross_reference> (1997) (citing RCW <cross_reference>34.05.534</cross_reference>). Under RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.300</cross_reference>(5), a party aggrieved by a final Board decision may appeal to superior court. Here, the October 26, 2001, order was the Board's final decision.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

  ¶11  The various stages of this litigation are part of a single proceeding. The County attempted to redraft its critical areas ordinance after the first Board decision and the County properly appealed to the superior court when the Board ruled against it a second time. After the superior<page_number>Page 133</page_number>
court reversed the Board, PPF appealed to this court. PPF's procedural arguments fail.

<center>                         II. Standard of Review</center>  ¶12  In reviewing a superior court's ruling on a Board decision, we apply the Administrative Procedure Act<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>
standards directly to the agency record. <italic>City of Redmond</italic><italic>v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd.</italic>,<cross_reference>136 Wn.2d 38</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>45</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>959 P.2d 1091</cross_reference> (1998) (citing <italic>Tapper v.</italic><italic>Employment Sec. Dep't</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn.2d 397</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>402</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>858 P.2d 494</cross_reference>
(1993)). Under RCW <cross_reference>34.05.570</cross_reference>(3)(d), we can grant relief if the agency has misinterpreted or misapplied the law — questions we consider de novo. <italic>Honesty in Envtl. Analysis</italic><italic> Legislation (HEAL) v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt.</italic><italic>Hearings Bd.</italic>, <cross_reference>96 Wn. App. 522</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>526</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>979 P.2d 864</cross_reference> (1999). Generally we give deference to an agency's interpretation of the law if it has expertise in dealing with the issue.<italic>HEAL</italic>, <cross_reference>96 Wn. App. at 526</cross_reference>. We can also grant relief from a Board decision if substantial evidence does not support it. RCW <cross_reference>34.05.570</cross_reference>(3)(e). Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to persuade a fair-minded person that the Board's order is correct. <italic>HEAL</italic>, <cross_reference>96 Wn. App. at 526</cross_reference>. The party challenging the agency action bears the burden of showing that the action is invalid. RCW <cross_reference>34.05.570</cross_reference>(1)(a). Here, the County bears the burden of demonstrating that the Board's decision was invalid. But because the legislature has clearly stated its intent to give counties considerable discretion in land use planning under the GMA, we give no deference to a "board's ruling that fails to apply this `more deferential standard of review' to a county's action." <italic>Quadrant Corp. v. State</italic><italic>Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd.</italic>, <cross_reference>154 Wn.2d 224</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>238</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>110 P.3d 1132</cross_reference> (2005).

<center>                   III. Preexisting Agricultural Uses</center>  ¶13  PPF argues that the GMA requires the County to regulate preexisting agricultural uses in critical areas. The<page_number>Page 134</page_number>
County disagrees. No court has decided whether the GMA allows reasonable regulation of preexisting agricultural uses located in designated critical areas.

  ¶14  Under the GMA, cities and counties with certain populations and rates of growth must adopt development regulations "to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(1). Regulations adopted under subsection (1) "may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(1). The GMA also requires all counties to adopt development regulations for critical areas. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(2). "Critical areas" include (a) wetlands, (b) areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water, (c) fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, (d) frequently flooded areas, and (e) geologically hazardous areas. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.030</cross_reference>(5). Counties must "include the best available science" when they develop their critical areas regulations and give special consideration to "conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fisheries." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.172</cross_reference>(1). When adopting development regulations, counties must balance numerous GMA goals. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>. One of these goals is to "[m]aintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive . . . agricultural . . . industries [and] [e]ncourage the conservation of . . . productive agricultural lands." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>(8).

  ¶15  Unlike RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(1), subsection (2) is silent on whether it applies to preexisting uses. PPF argues that this demonstrates the legislature's intent that critical areas regulations apply to preexisting uses because it would have written in an exemption, as it did subsection (1), had it intended otherwise.

  ¶16  Our primary goal in interpreting a statute is to determine and give effect to the legislature's intent. <italic>King</italic><italic>County v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd.</italic>,<cross_reference>142 Wn.2d 543</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>555</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>14 P.3d 133</cross_reference> (2000) (quoting <italic>Nat'l</italic><italic>Elec.</italic><page_number>Page 135</page_number><italic>Contractors Ass'n v. Riveland</italic>, <cross_reference>138 Wn.2d 9</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>19</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>978 P.2d 481</cross_reference> (1999)). We begin with the statute's plain language and ordinary meaning. <italic>King County</italic>, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d at 555</cross_reference>. And we interpret all the statutory provisions and their relation to each other to determine intent. <italic>Skagit</italic><italic>Surveyors  Eng'rs, L.L.C. v. Friends of Skagit</italic><italic>County</italic>, <cross_reference>135 Wn.2d 542</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>564</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>958 P.2d 962</cross_reference> (1998).

  ¶17  In passing the GMA, the State did not require all counties to adopt development regulations governing natural resource lands under RCW 36.70A.060d). But it did require all counties, regardless of size and population, to adopt critical areas development regulations under RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(2). And RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(2) does not contain subsection (1)'s exemption for preexisting uses.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

  ¶18  Still, subsection (2) specifies <italic>development</italic>
regulations, suggesting that the County must adopt regulations that concern only development proposals, necessarily a prospective concept. But section .030(7) defines "Development regulations" and "regulation" as "controls placed on development or <italic>land use activities.</italic>" And, section .172(1) requires counties and cities to use the best available science in "developing <italic>policies</italic> and development regulations to protect the functions and values of critical areas." Thus, the GMA defines "development regulations" more broadly than simply future development regulations; it includes controls placed on land use activities. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.030</cross_reference>. And in protecting critical areas, counties and cities must use the best available science to promulgate not just development regulations, but <italic>policies</italic> intended to protect critical areas. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.172</cross_reference>. With this language, the legislature signaled its intent that the counties regulate critical areas,<page_number>Page 136</page_number>
including existing uses, to advance the GMA's goals. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>.

  ¶19  As we have discussed, we generally give considerable deference to a Board's interpretation of statutes with which it regularly deals. <italic>Ferry County v. Concerned Friends of Ferry</italic><italic>County</italic>, <cross_reference>121 Wn. App. 850</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>856</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>90 P.3d 698</cross_reference> (2004),<italic>review granted in part by</italic> <cross_reference>153 Wn.2d 1016</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>106 P.3d 243</cross_reference>
(2005). The western and eastern Washington Boards have both interpreted the GMA to allow regulation of preexisting agricultural uses in critical areas. <italic>See, e.g., Friends of</italic><italic>Skagit County v. Skagit County</italic>, No. 96-2-0025, W. Wash. Growth Mgmt. Hr'gs Bd. Final Dec. and Order (Wash. Jan. 3, 1997), <cross_reference>1997 WL 8935</cross_reference> at <cross_reference>7</cross_reference>; <italic>Larson Beach Neighbors v. Stevens</italic><italic>County</italic>, No. 03-1-0003, E. Wash. Growth Mgmt. Hr'gs Bd. Final Dec. and Order (Wash. Feb. 10, 2004), <cross_reference>2004 WL 3404211</cross_reference> at *14.

  ¶20  PPF argues that the only published decision addressing an agricultural exemption, <italic>Whidbey Environmental</italic><italic>Action Network (WEAN) v. Island County</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. 156</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>181-82</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>93 P.3d 885</cross_reference> (2004), <italic>review denied</italic>,<cross_reference>153 Wn.2d 1025</cross_reference> (2005),<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> necessarily implies that the GMA's mandate to protect critical areas applies to preexisting agricultural uses.

  ¶21  In <italic>WEAN</italic>, Island County adopted an agricultural exemption to its CAO for "`[e]xisting and on-going agricultural activities when undertaken pursuant to best management practices to minimize impacts to critical areas.'"<italic>WEAN</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. at 182</cross_reference> (alteration in original) (quoting Island County Code (ICC) 17.02.107(E)(1) (now codified at 17.02.040(E)(1)). The Board ruled that this exemption complied with the GMA as to land zoned rural agricultural. But it ruled that the County had inappropriately balanced nondesignated agricultural uses against critical area protections by applying the agricultural activities exemption to land in the general rural zoning classification. The court<page_number>Page 137</page_number>
affirmed the Board on a different basis, holding that the County had failed to produce evidence that there was a need to extend the exemption to more than just designated agricultural lands. <italic>WEAN</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. at 183</cross_reference>. Although<italic>WEAN</italic> did not consider the question before this court, it did not disapprove of regulating preexisting agriculture in critical areas.

  ¶22  We conclude that the plain language of chapter <cross_reference>36.70A</cross_reference>
RCW demonstrates the legislature's intent that GMA counties and cities exercise some measure of control over preexisting uses in critical areas. Reading a broad exemption into critical areas regulation for preexisting uses would frustrate, not further, the legislature's intent.

<center>                        IV. The Board's Decision</center>  ¶23  Clallam sought to exercise such control by exempting certain agriculture from its critical areas ordinance. But the Board invalidated the exemption, finding that:

<block_quote>  [A]n important aspect of [the exemption] is that it is not limited to designated [agricultural resource land]. The exemption allows any "agricultural activity" lawfully operated prior to the effective date of the ordinance. While presumably the entire 7,500 acres of designated [agricultural resource land] would qualify, so would potentially thousands of other acres. The County has no way of knowing the extent of the exemption's coverage, particularly given the lack of definition of "agricultural activities."</block_quote>

Administrative Record (AR), Index 9, at 10.

  ¶24  The Board was particularly concerned that "adopting a process that involves reduction of CA [critical areas] protections for lots as small as 1 acre is not a proper, nor allowable, balancing of GMA goals." AR, Index 30, at 10.

  ¶25  The Board may have been at least partially mistaken, however. As of May 2001, the County had identified 6,995 acres of agricultural resource land and 21,753 acres of chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference>
RCW qualified land. The Board's record also included a transcript of a Clallam County Board of Commissioners'<page_number>Page 138</page_number>
work session in which a planning biologist estimated that even less land (about 15,000 or 16,000 acres) would qualify in 2002.

<center>                          V. Chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference> RCW</center>  ¶26  The County argues that limiting the agriculture exemption to chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference> RCW qualified land is consistent with the GMA's goals of maintaining natural resource industries, retaining open space, and preserving historically significant lands. <italic>See</italic> RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>; RCW <cross_reference>84.34.010</cross_reference>. RCW <cross_reference>84.34.010</cross_reference> provides:

<block_quote>  The legislature hereby declares that it is in the best interest of the state to maintain, preserve, conserve and otherwise continue in existence adequate open space lands for the production of food. . . . The legislature further declares that assessment practices must be so designed as to permit the continued availability of open space lands for these purposes.</block_quote>

  ¶27  The purpose of chapter <cross_reference>84.34</cross_reference> RCW is "to encourage owners to retain their land for farm use and to resist the trend to sell agricultural land for urban subdivision." <italic>Van</italic><italic>Buren v. Miller</italic>, <cross_reference>22 Wn. App. 836</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>837</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>592 P.2d 671</cross_reference>
(1979). The statute recognizes:<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

<block_quote>  that if farmland adjacent to a city is assessed at its highest and best use upon comparable sales of adjacent farmland which is being used for urban purposes, the assessed value would be grossly disproportionate to the use. Thus, as to land which is in open spaces, the assessment is to be reached considering not comparable sales of similar land to real estate developers, but rather by comparable farm leases made by other farmers of their land.</block_quote>

<italic>Van Buren</italic>, <cross_reference>22 Wn. App. at 837-38</cross_reference>.<page_number>Page 139</page_number>

  ¶28  Under the GMA, counties must balance protecting the environment (including water quality) and maintaining natural resource industries including agriculture. <italic>See</italic>
RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>(8), (10). In 1997, the legislature replaced the preponderance of the evidence standard of review for local GMA regulations in RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.320</cross_reference>(3) with the more deferential clearly erroneous standard. LAWS OF 1997, ch. <cross_reference>429</cross_reference>, § 20. It did so "[i]n recognition of the broad range of discretion that may be exercised by counties . . . consistent with the requirements of [the GMA]." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.3201</cross_reference>. And the legislature "intend [ed] for the boards to grant deference to counties and cities in how they plan for growth, consistent with the requirements and goals of [the GMA]." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.3201</cross_reference>. The "ultimate burden and responsibility for . . . harmonizing the planning goals" of the GMA rests with each county. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.3201</cross_reference>.

  ¶29  The Board has apparently adopted a policy favoring exemptions to critical areas ordinances only for designated agricultural resource lands. <italic>Island County Citizens' Growth</italic><italic>Mgmt. Coalition v. Island County</italic>, No. 98-02-0023c, W Wash. Growth Mgmt. Hr'gs Bd. Compliance Hearing Order (Nov. 17, 2000),<cross_reference>2000 WL 1729640</cross_reference> at <cross_reference>6</cross_reference>, and Final Dec. and Order (June 2, 1999),<cross_reference>1999 WL 396745</cross_reference> at *32-33; <italic>Friends of Skagit County v. Skagit</italic><italic>County</italic>, No. 96--2-0025, W Wash. Growth Mgmt. Hr'gs Bd. Compliance Hr'g Order (Sept. 16, 1998), <cross_reference>1998 WL 637160</cross_reference>, at *23. To the extent the Board decided that the County's exemption must be limited to designated resource lands, it erred. Such a policy runs counter to the GMA's emphasis on balancing the goals of preserving farmlands and protecting the environment and fish and wildlife — a balancing that the County is entitled to engage in with its local circumstances in mind; and a balancing to which the Board must give the County considerable deference. See <italic>Quadrant</italic>, <cross_reference>154 Wn.2d at 237-38</cross_reference>.

  ¶30  Moreover, the GMA specifically recognizes the importance of rural lands and rural character. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.011</cross_reference>. The legislature has found that in defining its rural element, a county should foster land use patterns that<page_number>Page 140</page_number>
preserve rural lifestyle and provide opportunities for small-scale, rural-based employment and self-employment. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.011</cross_reference>. A county must include in its GMA plan a rural element containing land not designated agriculture, which rural element "shall permit rural development, forestry, and agriculture in rural areas." RCW 36.70A.070-(5)(b). These policy statements show a legislative intent to foster both designated agriculture under RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.170</cross_reference> and rural agriculture that is not designated. We conclude that the County may balance the preservation of nondesignated agriculture against preservation of the environment under critical areas regulation. Accordingly, the County may frame its critical areas exemption more broadly than to include just designated farm land.

  ¶31  This is not to say that the Board must approve the County's current exemption plan. If the County, to meet its local conditions, wants to exempt a number of small farms, it must then show that by using best available science it has tailored the exemption to reasonably ameliorate potential harm to the environment and fish and wildlife. And the regulations must specifically address any threatened harm peculiar to the number and size of farms exempted. If the Board finds that the County has not met this burden, on remand the County may either reduce the amount of exempt land or more strictly control the more broadly exempted land.

  ¶32  In conclusion, we hold that the Board correctly ruled that preexisting agricultural uses are not exempt from all critical areas regulation. The Board erred in ruling that the County may exempt only designated agricultural resource land from full critical areas regulation. The County may expand its exempt agricultural land to meet its local conditions. But the County must balance such expanded exemption with corresponding restrictions that take into account the specific harms threatened by the expanded class of farm lands. Because the Board has not yet addressed the County's BMP (best management practices) restrictions, we do not address the parties' arguments on this issue.<page_number>Page 141</page_number>

  ¶33  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Board for further proceedings.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> The original House bill did exempt existing uses from critical areas regulation. But the exemption was removed from the final bill. A legislative report explains that "The restriction is removed from the GMA that interim development regulations to protect natural resource lands and critical areas may not prohibit prior permitted uses. Interim development regulations to protect natural resource lands may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to the adoption of the interim development regulations." H.R. 52-1025, 52nd Wash. Leg., 1st Spec. Sess., at 4 (1991). Thus, the legislature intended to prevent interim natural resource land regulations from prohibiting existing uses but not critical areas regulations.</footnote_body>

</dissent_byline><dissent_text>  ¶34  The majority holds that the Growth Management Act (GMA), chapter <cross_reference>36.70A</cross_reference> RCW, permits the Growth Management Board (Board) to invalidate Clallam County's (County) preexisting agricultural uses exemption from the County's critical areas ordinance. I respectfully dissent because the Board has not been granted authority to mandate regulation of preexisting land uses in critical areas.

II. The Growth Management Hearings Boards Authority

  ¶39  The County argues that the GMA does not require local governments to regulate preexisting agricultural land uses in critical areas. The fact that the Board found the GMA to require regulation of preexisting agricultural land<page_number>Page 143</page_number>
uses in critical areas raises the issue of whether the GMA grants authority to the Board to make such a finding.

  ¶40  The GMA grants the Board specific authority to determine whether county actions comply with the GMA. <italic>Skagit</italic><italic>Surveyors</italic>, <cross_reference>135 Wn.2d at 558-59</cross_reference>. The GMA requires cities and counties with specified rates of growth and certain populations to adopt development regulations "to assure the conservation of agricultural, forest, and mineral resource lands." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(1). Subsection (1) further requires that the development regulations "may not prohibit uses legally existing on any parcel prior to their adoption." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(1).

  ¶41  Additionally, the GMA requires <underline>all</underline> counties to adopt development regulations for critical areas. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>(2). Critical areas include "(a) [w]etlands; (b) areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water; (c) fish and wildlife conservation areas; (d) frequently flooded areas; and (e) geologically hazardous areas." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.030</cross_reference>(5). Counties are required to "include the best available science [BAS]" in developing critical areas regulations. RCW 36.70A.172Q). Counties are also required to balance numerous express GMA goals in adopting development regulations. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.172</cross_reference>(1).

  ¶42  Neither RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.060</cross_reference>, RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.172</cross_reference>, nor any other provision of the GMA expressly mandates a county to regulate preexisting uses in critical areas. Thus, the Board has no express authority to require regulation of preexisting agricultural uses in critical areas.

<center>                 <italic>Necessarily Implied Statutory Authority</italic></center>  ¶43  Administrative agencies generally have implied authority that is reasonably necessary to carry out express authority granted by the legislature. <italic>Skagit</italic><italic>Surveyors</italic>, <cross_reference>135 Wn.2d at 564</cross_reference>. "[W]here implied authority to grant or impose a particular remedy is not clearly set forth in the statutory language or its broad implication, the courts of<page_number>Page 144</page_number>
this state have been reluctant to find such authority on the part of the agency." <italic>Skagit Surveyors</italic>,<cross_reference>135 Wn.2d at 565</cross_reference>.

  ¶44  This court's interpretation of a statute is a question of law, reviewed de novo. <italic>King County v. Cent.</italic><italic>Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd.</italic>, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d 543</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>555</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>14 P.3d 133</cross_reference> (2000). When interpreting a statute, our goal is to determine and give effect to the legislature's intent. <italic>King</italic><italic>County</italic>, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d at 555</cross_reference> (citing <italic>Nat'l Elec.</italic><italic>Contractors Ass'n v. Riveland</italic>, <cross_reference>138 Wn.2d 9</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>19</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>978 P.2d 481</cross_reference> (1999)). To determine legislative intent, we look at the statute's plain language and ordinary meaning. <italic>King</italic><italic>County</italic>, <cross_reference>142 Wn.2d at 555</cross_reference>.

  ¶45  The majority concluded that the statutory framework of the GMA clearly demonstrates legislative intent to require counties to "exercise some measure of control over preexisting uses in critical areas." Majority at 137. Moreover, the majority concludes that interpreting a broad exemption into critical areas regulation for preexisting uses would frustrate legislative intent of the GMA. Majority at 137. Contrary to the majority's holding, however, the statutory framework of the GMA does not necessarily imply the Board has statutory authority to construe the GMA to mandate regulation of preexisting agricultural land use in critical areas. Reading the GMA in such a way would frustrate the purpose and goals of the GMA.

  ¶46  The underlying purpose of the GMA is to control urban sprawl and to ensure the private and public sectors cooperate in the creation of comprehensive land planning. <italic>Quadrant</italic><italic>Corp. v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd.</italic>,<cross_reference>119 Wn. App. 562</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>578</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>81 P.3d 918</cross_reference> (2003), <italic>rev'd on other</italic><italic>grounds</italic>, <cross_reference>154 Wn.2d 224</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>110 P.3d 1132</cross_reference> (2005). The regulation of preexisting uses would have little to no influence on uncontrolled expansion of urbanization into rural areas.

  ¶47  The GMA also expressly states goals that "are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations . . . and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development<page_number>Page 145</page_number>
of comprehensive plans and development regulations." RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>. One of the goals of the GMA is to protect private property owners from discriminatory actions. RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>(6).<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

  ¶48  The record shows no grounds for the distinction between agricultural preexisting land uses and other preexisting land uses. Therefore, the Board's apparent intent to regulate only preexisting agricultural uses in critical areas and not other preexisting land uses is discriminatory and thus contrary to an express goal of the GMA. <italic>See</italic>
RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>(6). Moreover, if the GMA is read to include all preexisting uses in critical areas, every business, home, golf course, etc. would be required to abide by BAS. <italic>See</italic>
RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.172</cross_reference>. BAS could very well dictate no use whatsoever. Prohibiting private citizens from using private land would frustrate RCW <cross_reference>36.70A.020</cross_reference>(6).

  ¶49  Furthermore, Washington state courts have declined to find that the GMA mandates regulation of preexisting agricultural land uses in critical areas. There is no published court opinion addressing the issue directly, but in <italic>WEAN v.</italic><italic>Island County</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. 156</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>93 P.3d 885</cross_reference> (2004), the court avoided the issue.

  ¶50  In <italic>WEAN v. Island County</italic>, Division One of this court addressed the issue of whether Island County's agricultural exemption<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> to its Critical Area Ordinance (CAO) was overbroad. <italic>WEAN</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. at 181</cross_reference>. The Board found the exemption to comply with the GMA as to land zoned rural agriculture. <italic>WEAN</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. at 182</cross_reference>. But the Board also found that Island County had "inappropriately balanced `non-designated agricultural uses' against critical area protections by allowing the application of the<page_number>Page 146</page_number>
exemption to agricultural activities." <italic>WEAN</italic>,<cross_reference>122 Wn. App. at 182</cross_reference>.

  ¶51  The court did not address whether the exemption frustrated the critical area protection requirements of the GMA. Rather, the court affirmed on a different basis. The court held that Island County failed to produce evidence supporting the exemption was necessary to protect agricultural activity. The court reasoned that Island County failed to produce evidence showing it considered BAS in the development of the exemption. <italic>WEAN</italic>, <cross_reference>122 Wn. App. at 184</cross_reference>. Thus, the court declined to address whether the Board correctly construed the GMA to regulate preexisting agriculture in existing areas.

  ¶52  Here, the issue is not whether Clallam County provided evidence to support the need for an exemption.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference>
The issue is whether the GMA grants the Board the fundamental authority to mandate regulation of preexisting agricultural land use in critical areas. Because <italic>WEAN</italic>
does not address the issue at hand, it has no persuasive authority for us. The argument of the County is most compelling that the intent of the GMA is to control and mitigate the negative impact of future growth and development, not preexisting, on-going activities.

  ¶53  In conclusion, reading the GMA to grant authority to the Board to mandate regulation of preexisting agricultural uses in critical areas frustrates both the purpose and goals of the GMA. First, the regulation of preexisting agricultural land uses in critical areas would have minimal, if any, influence on uncontrolled expansion of urbanization into rural areas. Next, there is no reference in the GMA distinguishing between agricultural preexisting land uses and other preexisting land uses. Such a distinction, therefore, would be discriminatory and contrary to Goal 6 of the GMA. Further, regulation of all preexisting land uses would hinder private land use contrary to the goals of the GMA.<page_number>Page 147</page_number>
Therefore, the GMA does not expressly or necessarily imply the Board's authority to mandate regulation of preexisting agricultural land uses in critical areas. I would affirm the trial court.
