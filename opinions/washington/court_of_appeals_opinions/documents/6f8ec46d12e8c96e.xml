<opinion_text><unpublished>  Jerry McIntosh appeals the judgment and sentence imposed after he was found guilty of one count of first degree theft and four counts of forgery. Through counsel, he contends the court erred by failing to consider the doctrine of merger. He also claims the theft and forgery charges constitute the same criminal conduct, which results in a lower offender score, and thus, a lower sentence. Pro se, he raises the issue of a speedy trial violation and various procedural irregularities related to his hearing impairment. Although we find no basis on which to reverse the judgment and sentence, the case is remanded to determine whether Mr. McIntosh's offender score, for sentencing purposes, was properly calculated.

<center>                                   Facts</center>
As a result of various allegedly illegal check writing and cashing schemes, Mr. McIntosh was arrested and charged in Spokane County Superior Court with one count of first degree theft other than a firearm and four counts of forgery. Because he remained incarcerated up to the date of trial, he filed a motion to dismiss based on a speedy trial violation. At the conclusion of a pretrial hearing, the court determined Mr. McIntosh had been arraigned on the current charges on July 2, 2002. After a few agreed continuances were entered, Mr. McIntosh was released on his own recognizance on the current charges on day 60, pursuant to CrR 3.3(c)(1), which changed the speedy trial time clock from the 60-day to the 90-day schedule. See State v. Huffmeyer, <cross_reference>102 Wn. App. 121</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>123-24</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>5 P.3d 1289</cross_reference> (2000), aff'd, <cross_reference>145 Wn.2d 52</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>32 P.3d 996</cross_reference> (2001). However, he remained incarcerated on other charges up to and during his trial on the current charges. This led to his filing the motion to dismiss, which the trial court denied. Mr. McIntosh filed various other pretrial pro se motions, which included the same speedy trial issue, a joinder issue, and a request for appointment of appellate counsel (even though the trial had not yet occurred), all of which were denied.

Mr. McIntosh was found guilty as charged on all five counts after a bench trial on the merits. Findings and conclusions regarding the outcome were filed but Mr. McIntosh did not assign error to any of them, making the findings verities on appeal. State v. Hill, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d 641</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>644</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>870 P.2d 313</cross_reference> (1994). He received a standard range sentence based on an offender score of nine, which was based on the following criminal history:

<center>                                  Analysis</center><center>                             1. Merger Doctrine</center>
Mr. McIntosh first contends the trial court improperly calculated his offender score because it failed to merge the theft conviction with three of his forgery convictions (counts II through IV). He claims that since the three counts of forgery were the means utilized to accomplish the first degree theft, the merger doctrine applies under the facts of this case. We disagree.

The <cross_reference>fifth</cross_reference> amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits courts from imposing more than one punishment for the same offense. State v. Noltie, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d 831</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>848</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>809 P.2d 190</cross_reference> (1981). The merger doctrine springs from this double jeopardy protection. The doctrine does not prevent alternative or multiple charging; its application is limited to sentencing decisions. State v. Michielli, <cross_reference>132 Wn.2d 229</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>238-39</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>937 P.2d 587</cross_reference> (1997). It is explained as follows:

<block_quote>  [T]he merger doctrine is a rule of statutory construction which only applies where the Legislature has clearly indicated that in order to prove a particular degree of crime (e.g., first degree rape) the State must prove not only that a defendant committed that crime (e.g., rape) but that the crime was accompanied by an act which is defined as a crime elsewhere in the criminal statutes (e.g., assault or kidnapping).</block_quote>

State v. Vladovic, <cross_reference>99 Wn.2d 413</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>420-21</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>662 P.2d 853</cross_reference> (1983). `In other words, crimes merge when proof of one crime is necessary to prove an element or the degree of another crime.' State v. Beals,<cross_reference>100 Wn. App. 189</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>193</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>997 P.2d 941</cross_reference> (2000).

Mr. McIntosh was convicted of first degree theft pursuant to RCW<cross_reference>9A.56.030</cross_reference>(1)(a). That statute makes it a crime to commit theft of property or services which exceed $1,500 in value (other than a firearm). He was also convicted of four counts of forgery pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>9A.60.020</cross_reference>, which makes it a crime to falsely make, complete, or alter a written instrument, with the intent to injure or defraud. A careful reading of the two statutes reveals that proof of forgery is not necessary to prove theft, nor has the legislature designated that the two separate criminal acts should merge.

Mr. McIntosh's reliance on State v. Prater, <cross_reference>30 Wn. App. 512</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>635 P.2d 1104</cross_reference> (1981) is inapplicable to the facts of this case. The fact that the crime of theft was ultimately committed by Mr. McIntosh by means of forging checks is irrelevant to the analysis of this issue. The only question that has to be resolved is whether the State had to prove forgery in order to sustain the first degree theft conviction. Because the relevant statutes have no such requirement, Mr. McIntosh's contention to the contrary fails. The merger doctrine does not apply under the facts of this case.

<center>                          2. Same Criminal Conduct</center>
As an alternative theory, Mr. McIntosh claims his convictions for theft by deception and forgery encompass the same criminal conduct, which should have resulted in a lower offender score and lower sentence. He maintains that because the forgeries were used to accomplish the theft, the crimes must involve the same criminal conduct. He is mistaken.

Former RCW 9.94A.400(1)(a) (1999), recodified as RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.589</cross_reference>(1)(a) (2001), defines same criminal conduct as `two or more crimes that require the same criminal intent, are committed at the same time and place, and involve the same victim.' The determination of whether prior offenses encompass the same criminal conduct involves factual determinations and trial court discretion. State v. Nitsch, <cross_reference>100 Wn. App. 512</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>520-21</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>997 P.2d 1000</cross_reference> (2000). As will be seen below, none of the crimes occurred at the same time nor did they involve the same criminal intent or the same victim in each case.

Each time Mr. McIntosh deposited a forged check, a separate crime was completed. See State v. Williams, <cross_reference>118 Wn. App. 178</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>183</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>73 P.3d 376</cross_reference>
(2003). The record shows he deposited four checks on four different occasions. On June 6, 2001, he deposited a check that was written on the business account of Ron Kappelman in the amount of $1,850 at a branch office of Farmers and Merchants Bank located on West Third Street in Spokane, Washington. This was the basis of counts I and II in the information. Two days later Mr. McIntosh cashed a check from his own account in the amount of $500. This was an alternate basis for count I. On June 9, he deposited a check at a branch located on East Mission Avenue in the amount of $1,850 from an account owned by the `Thur. Mens Group,' receiving $900 cash in return. CP at 85. This was the basis of counts I and III. On June 11, Mr. McIntosh cashed a check from his own account, in the amount of $900, at the branch located on East Mission. This was an alternate basis for count I. The same day, but at a different time, he cashed a check from his own account for $100 at the branch located on West Third. This, too, formed an alternate basis for count I. Again, the same day but at a different time than the prior two incidents, Mr. McIntosh deposited a second check to his account from the Thurs. Mens Group in the amount of $2,200 at the branch located on East Mission. He requested cash for the entire amount but was only given $800. This transaction formed the basis of counts I and IV. Again, at a separate time, but on the same date, at the branch located on East Mission, he attempted to deposit a check (from an account that had been reported stolen) in the amount of $1,200. Law enforcement officers were called but Mr. McIntosh left the bank prior to their arrival. He left the check on the counter at the bank. This formed the basis of count V. The next day he attempted to cash a check from his account in the amount of $1,300 at the branch located at Tidyman's on North Addison Street. At this point, Mr. McIntosh was apprehended by law enforcement officials and taken into custody.

In analyzing the same criminal conduct theory, the question is whether the legislature intended to punish the same conduct twice under different criminal provisions. Washington applies the same evidence test in order to determine legislative intent. State v. Calle, <cross_reference>125 Wn.2d 769</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>777-78</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>888 P.2d 155</cross_reference> (1995). Under this test, a defendant cannot be convicted of offenses that are identical both in fact and in law. Id. at 777. The convictions stand, however, if there is an element in each offense which is not included in the other, and if proof of one offense would not necessarily also prove the other. Vladovic, <cross_reference>99 Wn.2d at 423</cross_reference>. A close reading of the record convinces us this is the test applied by the trial court when it determined proof of forgery was not necessary to prove first degree theft; thus, the same criminal conduct test did not apply under the facts presented.

We next look at the three elements of the same criminal conduct test found in former RCW 9.94A.400(1)(a) and find they cannot be met under the facts of this case. For example, the same time and place element of the statutory test cannot be met because, as can be seen from the facts set forth above, each act of forgery occurred independently from the others and at different times and places than did the crime of theft. The forgeries occurred when the four illegal checks were deposited into Mr. McIntosh's account. The theft occurred when the money was withdrawn. The same result is reached when one analyzes the same intent element. Although the method of accomplishing the four forgeries was similar, each time Mr. McIntosh deposited a check from an account that had been closed or with a check that had been reported stolen, a new intent was formed. See State v. Young, <cross_reference>97 Wn. App. 235</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>241</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>984 P.2d 1050</cross_reference> (1999). The intent to forge stolen checks and deposit them into a personal bank account is different than the intent formed prior to removing the funds. Finally, three of the four victims of the forgeries were different and those victims are different from the bank, as the ultimate victim of the theft. There was a stolen check written on the business account of Ron Kappelman, two stolen checks written at different times from the Thurs. Mens Group, and one stolen check from a private account located at Spokane Teacher's Credit Union. Mr. McIntosh argues the only victim was Farmers and Merchants Bank. This court has already determined both the bank and the account holder are victims of the crime of forgery. State v. Calvert, <cross_reference>79 Wn. App. 569</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>580</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>903 P.2d 1003</cross_reference> (1995). Applying the statutory factors, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined the same criminal conduct test did not apply under the facts of this case.

<center>                             3. Offender Score</center>
Finally, we are asked to consider whether Mr. McIntosh's offender score was properly calculated pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (former RCW 9.94A.360(2) (1999), recodified as RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.525</cross_reference>(2) (2001)). These arguments were not made during the sentencing hearing and are being raised for the first time on appeal, which normally precludes our review. RAP 2.5(a). Additionally, there is no information contained in the record regarding the release dates for Mr. McIntosh's various crimes, which is necessary to determine his offender score under the washout statute in effect on the date the current crimes occurred. However, the State agrees that the washout statute, former RCW 9.94A.400(1)(a) (1999), recodified as RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.589</cross_reference>(1)(a) (2001), does not apply retroactively and was improperly applied at Mr. McIntosh's sentencing hearing. State v. Perry, <cross_reference>110 Wn. App. 554</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>42 P.3d 436</cross_reference>
(2002). For that reason and because the record on appeal is inadequate to determine whether the offender score was properly calculated under the statute, the State agrees the case should be remanded so further facts may be obtained. See State v. Tili, <cross_reference>148 Wn.2d 350</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>358</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>60 P.3d 1192</cross_reference>
(2003) (remand necessary when offender score miscalculated unless record makes clear court would impose same sentence). We support the parties' agreement on this issue and remand the case for proper resolution.

<center>                               Pro Se Issues</center>
Pro se, Mr. McIntosh first contends his speedy trial rights were violated because his second trial did not commence until day 110 of his incarceration on the current charges. He misinterprets the court rule.

This issue was fully analyzed by the trial court in a pretrial hearing when it correctly decided the same issue Mr. McIntosh raises here on appeal. Mr. McIntosh was released from jail on the current charges on day 60, which, pursuant to CrR 3.3(c)(1), changed the speedy trial time clock from 60 to 90 days. However, he remained incarcerated on charges unrelated to those on which he was just released. This is where the criminal rules become confusing for Mr. McIntosh. Because he remained in jail (albeit on other charges) he believed his speedy trial rights were violated. He is mistaken.

Next, Mr. McIntosh complains he was unable to make a legal phone call until after he had been incarcerated for 18 days. Although this allegation may be true, there are no facts in the record that would support his contention. Because additional facts are necessary to resolve this issue, Mr. McIntosh will need to timely file a personal restraint petition (PRP) pursuant to the procedure set forth in RAP 16.4(c)(3). We are unable to resolve this issue on the facts contained in the record.

Third, Mr. McIntosh complains he was not provided access to a teleprompter during his trial, which would have allowed him to meaningfully participate in his defense. A review of the record reveals Mr. McIntosh did not object (prior to or during the pretrial hearings or his trial) to the use of interpreters using American Sign Language. If it is true that he asked for and was denied access to a teleprompter, that information was not contained in the record. Just as in the analysis above, if Mr. McIntosh believes facts exist that would prove his allegation, the PRP procedure will need to be utilized.

We affirm the convictions but remand for a full investigation regarding Mr. McIntosh's offender score at which time he may need to be resentenced.

A majority of the panel has determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>.

BROWN, C.J., and SWEENEY, J., concur.
