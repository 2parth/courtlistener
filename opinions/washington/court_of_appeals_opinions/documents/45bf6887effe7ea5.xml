</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  W.H. appeals from an order of involuntary civil commitment detaining him for treatment at Western State Hospital for a period of up to 180 days. He contends that evidence was insufficient to support the court's finding that he had committed acts that would constitute a felony. But circumstantial evidence supports a finding by clear, cogent and convincing proof that W.H. killed his mother, believing as a result of a psychotic delusion that she was an imposter who had assumed his mother's identity. And because the other issues W.H. raises are moot and do not involve matters of continuing and substantial public interest, we decline to review them and accordingly affirm the trial court.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>
The body of 83-year-old Dorothy Hockett was found near a remote logging road approximately five miles from the rural Mason County home she shared with her son, W.H.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> She died from two gunshot wounds and blunt force trauma to her head. Police collected physical evidence from the house and arrested W.H.W.H. told them that the woman he had lived with was not his real mother, who had been killed in World War II in the 1950s. W.H. was charged with second degree murder.

After an initial mental evaluation, W.H. was determined to be incompetent to stand trial. The Superior Court ordered W.H. to be treated at Western State Hospital (WSH). After more than a year of unsuccessful attempts to render W.H. competent, the Superior Court determined that W.H. could not reasonably be treated to become competent, dismissed the charge without prejudice, and ordered W.H. detained for civil commitment proceedings. Pursuant to the court's order, treatment providers at WSH evaluated W.H. for civil commitment. Concluding that grounds for commitment existed, Dr. Sandra Karlsvik and Dr. Murray Hart filed a petition for 180 days of involuntary treatment for W.H. Pursuant to RCW<cross_reference>71.05.280</cross_reference>(3), the petition alleged that W.H. was `in custody after having been determined incompetent pursuant to RCW 10.77 and has committed acts constituting a felony (although Criminal charges have been dismissed), and as a result of a mental disorder, presents a substantial likelihood of repeating similar acts. . . .'<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> An amended petition later added an alternative ground under RCW <cross_reference>71.05.280</cross_reference>(4) that W.H. was gravely disabled.

At trial, the court found the allegations proved by clear, cogent and convincing evidence and ordered a 180-day commitment. W.H. appeals, challenging sufficiency of the evidence of the three findings that he had committed a felony, was likely to repeat similar acts, and was gravely disabled.

Preliminarily, W.H. correctly acknowledges that two of his claims are moot. The sufficiency of the proof of his risk of committing violent acts and his status as gravely disabled present only academic questions because W.H. has completed the 180-day commitment in issue and the State may not rely on those findings to support future commitments. W.H. contends that we should nonetheless address these issues because they raise questions of public importance. But challenges to civil commitments that turn on facts unique to a particular case and that are unlikely to recur do not support review of moot claims. See In re Detention of W.R.G., <cross_reference>110 Wn. App. 318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>322</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>40 P.3d 1177</cross_reference> (2002); In re Detention of R.W., <cross_reference>98 Wn. App. 140</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>143-44</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>988 P.2d 1034</cross_reference> (1999). Such is the case here. Accordingly, we consider only the question of whether sufficient evidence supported the finding that W.H. had committed acts that would constitute a felony, as this finding is unlike the others because it may be used by the State to support future commitments without having to reprove the allegation.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

Where sufficiency of the evidence is challenged, we review the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. Goodman v. Boeing Co.,<cross_reference>75 Wn. App. 60</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>82</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>877 P.2d 703</cross_reference> (1994), aff'd, <cross_reference>127 Wn.2d 401</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>899 P.2d 1265</cross_reference> (1995). In the setting of civil commitments, the question is whether the finding is supported by evidence that the lower court could reasonably have found to be clear, cogent and convincing. In re LaBelle, <cross_reference>107 Wn.2d 196</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>209</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>728 P.2d 138</cross_reference> (1986).

Dorothy's body was found near a remote logging road on March 7, 2001. She had suffered blunt force trauma to her head and two bullet wounds to her chest. One of the bullets had encountered only soft tissue; the other had struck her backbone. Both bullets had passed through her body and no bullets were found where the body was located. In her right ear was part of a hearing aid, but the electronic part designed to fit behind the ear was not located. No glasses were found near her body, and she had no identification.

Dorothy's body was identified on March 10, when her next-door neighbor, Barbara Giusti, called police. Barbara and her husband Raymond had lived next to Dorothy and W.H. for more than eight years. On March 6, 2001, Barbara talked to Dorothy at approximately 1:00 p.m. At about 5:00 that afternoon, Raymond saw W.H. back Dorothy's truck into the driveway. Later that evening, the Giustis heard the truck drive out. It was gone for approximately an hour and a half before it returned. On March 10, not having seen Dorothy, Barbara became concerned and went to Dorothy's house. W.H. told her that Dorothy had gone to visit her sister Ruby in Oregon. Barbara did not believe him because Dorothy had never left W.H. alone at home before. Barbara called Ruby. When she learned Dorothy was not there, she called police.

Another neighbor, Raymond Minish, testified that he had been walking near Dorothy's house on March 6 between 4 and 5 in the afternoon when he heard two gunshots come from the direction of Dorothy's house. Dorothy's sister Ruby testified that there were no plans for Dorothy to visit her in March 2001. Dorothy had not visited her since 1978, and then she had brought W.H. with her.

When police searched Dorothy's home, they found outside the back door two shell casings and two spent bullets. One of the bullets was relatively intact, the other deformed as if it had struck something hard. The bullets and casings were analyzed and determined to have been fired by a .22 caliber pistol that police found in a dresser drawer in W.H.'s bedroom. Police also found, outside the house, a piece of a hearing aid that completed the part found on Dorothy's body. Dorothy's purse, containing her identification, was inside the house. The only pair of Dorothy's glasses police could find was in a box in the back of a second, nonworking pickup truck that was registered to W.H.

Police spoke to W.H. He told them that the woman that had lived at the house with him was named Lindsey Audra Buckner. She was one of 42 Buckner girls, who had the same name and appearance and were lizard-skinned people. Although he sometimes called the one that he had been living with `Ma,' it was not because she was his mother, but because `Ma' meant `body pack.'<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> He said Buckner was getting money by using his name. His real parents had died in World War II, which, contrary to the history books, had not ended until the 1950s. Buckner was living with him to monitor him to see if he was communicating with the `Olympic Bedouin Company' that was at war with other companies from Olympia. He denied leaving the house on March 6 and said Ruby, another of the Buckner girls, had sent a woman who picked up the one living with him in a `Toyo-Carol' car.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> He told police he was familiar with the road where Dorothy's body was found from having driven logging trucks years before.

W.H. points out that no human DNA was identified, blood spatter evidence was inconclusive, the recovered bullets were never conclusively proved to be the ones that killed Dorothy, and the Giustis did not hear gunshots on March 6. But in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we draw all reasonable inferences from circumstantial evidence in favor of the party that bore the burden of proof. State v. Salinas,<cross_reference>119 Wn.2d 192</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>201</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829 P.2d 1068</cross_reference> (1992).

Dorothy's death was not the result of an accident. The location of the hearing aid parts suggested Dorothy suffered the blow to her head at her home. The bullets that corresponded with her wounds likewise suggested she was killed at home, as did the testimony that she always wore her glasses. The circumstances also suggested W.H. was the only one present when Dorothy was killed. The house was located on a rural cul-de-sac, visitors were unusual, and the neighbors noticed none between March 6 and March 10. There was no sign of a burglary or robbery. The bullets came from W.H.'s gun and W.H.'s statements suggested that he had animosity towards Dorothy and was lying about how she left the house. In sum, the trial court could reasonably have found the evidence to be clear, cogent and convincing proof that W.H. had caused his mother's death in such a fashion as would have constituted the felony of second degree murder. Former RCW <cross_reference>9A.32.050</cross_reference>(1)(a).<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>

Affirmed.

GROSSE and COX, JJ., concur.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> After W.H. filed this appeal, the case was transferred from Division II to Division I of this court.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Clerk's Papers at 8.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> In his initial briefing, W.H. represented that the entirety of his appeal was moot. The State agreed. A commissioner of this court requested supplemental briefing, however, directing the parties' attention to RCW<cross_reference>71.05.320</cross_reference>(2). Under that statute, if the State seeks a subsequent 180-day commitment of an individual who had been previously committed pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>71.05.280</cross_reference>(3), it is not necessary to reprove the conduct that led to the original commitment. In supplemental briefing, the parties now agree that for this reason effective relief can still be provided to W.H. on the issue of whether sufficient evidence supported the finding that W.H. committed acts that would constitute a felony.</footnote_body>
