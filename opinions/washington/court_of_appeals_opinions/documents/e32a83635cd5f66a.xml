<opinion_text><unpublished>  The City of Lynnwood challenges the authority of the Alderwood Water and Wastewater District to assess city-owned property to finance the installation of sewers. The City also challenges the assessment because the District did not take into account the City's intent to use the parcels as a park. We conclude that the District has the statutory authority to assess property owned by the City. The District is not required to consider the property owner's proposed future use of the property in determining the extent to which a parcel is specially benefited by a local improvement. The assessment on the City's properties was not fundamentally flawed and the record supports the District's consideration of its method of assessment. We affirm.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
The Alderwood Water and Wastewater District (the District) is a special purpose municipal corporation with the power to establish local improvement districts and to levy special assessments. RCW <cross_reference>57.16.050</cross_reference>; RCW<cross_reference>35.51.010</cross_reference>(2). The District provides sewer service within its boundaries and is authorized to finance the construction of public sewers through the creation of Utility Local Improvement Districts (ULID). It is governed by a Board of Commissioners (the Board).

On a petition from a majority of the Swamp Creek Homeacre Tract property owners, the Board held a hearing and adopted resolutions to form a ULID to finance the installation of public sewers and to authorize construction of a sewer facility (ULID 96-02). In 1997, the District conducted a special benefits analysis to determine the benefit to each parcel in ULID 96-02 from this improvement.

In January 1999 and May 2000, the City of Lynnwood (the City) purchased two parcels of property within ULID 96-02. These parcels were purchased from private owners without any restrictions on future use.

Based on the special benefits analysis, the District proposed a final assessment roll for each parcel in ULID 96-02. On February 5, 2001 the City filed a protest and a written objection to the proposed final assessment. The City asked the Board to impose no assessment on its two parcels. The City argued that the District did not have the authority to assess property owned by it and sewers would not benefit the properties because the City intended to use these two parcels as a park.

The Board held a hearing on the proposed final assessment roll. The District's appraiser, consulting engineer and each property owner protesting the proposed assessment had the opportunity testify to before the Board. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board ruled on each of the protests. The Board overruled the protest of the City and confirmed the original assessment. The Board revised the assessments for several other properties. The Board entered findings and conclusions which included its decision for each of the protests and confirmed the assessment for ULID 96-02 as modified.

On appeal, the Snohomish County Superior Court affirmed the decision of the Board. The City appeals.

<center>                                 DISCUSSION</center>
The legislature has granted Water and Sewer Districts broad authority to assess property within its boundaries. RCW <cross_reference>57.16.050</cross_reference>. Under RCW<cross_reference>57.16.050</cross_reference> districts have authority to:

<block_quote>  (1).establish local improvement districts within its territory; levy special assessments.on all property specially benefited by a local improvement.</block_quote>

The City contends this statute does not authorize special purpose districts to levy assessments against city-owned property. This court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. State v. Bright,<cross_reference>129 Wn.2d 257</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>265</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>916 P.2d 922</cross_reference> (1996). We interpret statutes to give effect to the legislature's intent. <italic>Cherry v. Municipality of Metro.</italic><italic>Seattle</italic>, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d 794</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>799</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>808 P.2d 746</cross_reference> (1991). To determine legislative intent, we look first to the language of the statute. <italic>Lacey</italic><italic>Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep't of Revenue</italic>, <cross_reference>128 Wn.2d 40</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>53</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>905 P.2d 338</cross_reference>
(1995). When statutory language is clear, we assume that the legislature "meant exactly what it said" and apply the plain language of the statute. <italic>Duke v. Boyd</italic>, <cross_reference>133 Wn.2d 80</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>942 P.2d 351</cross_reference> (1997). In ascertaining the meaning of a particular word in a statute, a court must consider both the statute's subject matter and the context in which the word is used. <italic>Chamberlain v. Dep't of Transp</italic>., <cross_reference>79 Wn. App. 212</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>217</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>901 P.2d 344</cross_reference> (1995).

The general rule concerning assessment in Washington is that property covered by the general terms of a statute authorizing assessment, and not exempt, is subject to assessment. <italic>State ex. Rel. Renton v. Commercial</italic><italic>Waterway Dist. No. 2 et. al</italic>., <cross_reference>152 Wn. 523</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>529</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>278 P. 423</cross_reference> (1929). The property owned by the City is within the general terms of the statute and is not otherwise exempt. And although the City concedes that a literal reading of RCW <cross_reference>57.16.050</cross_reference> authorizes the District to assess its property, it argues that in order for municipal property to be subject to assessment there must be a separate statute expressly granting such authority.

The City argues that in spite of the "all property" statutory language, because federal land is not subject to assessment for local improvements, it is not. <italic>See John  Catherine Mullen Benevolent Corp.</italic><italic>v. United States</italic>, <cross_reference>290 U.S. 89</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>54 S.Ct. 38</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>78 L.Ed. 192</cross_reference> (1933) (special assessments may not be levied against federally owned land unless expressly authorized by federal legislation). However, this limitation is based on the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. See U.S. Const. art. <cross_reference>VI</cross_reference>, cl. <cross_reference>2</cross_reference>. There is no such constitutional limitation which affects the ability of special purpose districts to assess city-owned property.

The City also relies on the existence of RCW <cross_reference>79.44.010</cross_reference> and RCW <cross_reference>35.44.140</cross_reference>, which expressly authorize assessment against both state and county property and the absence of a similar statute for city property. RCW<cross_reference>79.44.010</cross_reference> authorizes all state-owned lands to be assessed for the costs of local improvements.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> RCW <cross_reference>35.44.140</cross_reference> expressly grants permission for assessments against county property. But there is no authority suggesting that county or city property would be exempt from assessment without explicit legislative authority.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> And well-established caselaw suggests otherwise. <italic>In re Howard Avenue North</italic>, <cross_reference>44 Wn. 62</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>86 P. 1117</cross_reference>
(1906); <italic>Spokane v. Fonnell</italic>, <cross_reference>75 Wn. 417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>135 P. 211</cross_reference> (1913). In Howard Avenue, a school district appealed assessments against its property by the City of Seattle for the cost of local improvements. The school district argued that its property could not be assessed in the absence of express legislative permission. The Washington Supreme Court rejected this argument and noted that if the legislature had intended to exempt school district property, it would have done so. The Court declined to find an implied exemption, stating:

<block_quote>  An exemption of any portion of the benefited property located within the assessment district would necessarily cause an increased burden to be imposed upon other benefited property located therein, and in view of this result we should refrain from adopting a construction of the statute which would relieve appellant's property, especially when there is no good reason for holding that such an exemption was intended by the legislature.</block_quote>

<italic>Howard Avenue</italic>, <cross_reference>44 Wn. at 65</cross_reference>.

In <italic>Spokane v. Fonnell</italic>, the Court concluded that school district property and a playground, owned by the City of Spokane, were improperly exempted from assessment by the City for local improvements. <italic>Fonnell</italic>,<cross_reference>75 Wn. at 424-25</cross_reference>. In this case, in its written objection to the final assessment role submitted to the Board, the City agreed that under Fonnell a city may assess its own property if the property is within the city's local improvement district. But as the District points out, a district's authority to assess property is coextensive with that of a city. RCW <cross_reference>57.16.050</cross_reference>(1) provides:

<block_quote>  (t)he levying, collection, and enforcement of assessments and the issuance of bonds shall be as provided for the levying, collection, and enforcement of special assessments and the issuance of local improvement district bonds by cities and towns insofar as is consistent with this title.</block_quote>

Based on this statutory authority if a city has the power to assess city property, a water district has the same power.

In summary, the District is authorized to assess the City's property.

There is no constitutional restriction on assessment of city property. Nor is there an explicit exemption of city property, and we decline to find an implied exemption. Moreover, as a city may assess city-owned property, so may a district, since districts possess the same power as cities under the statute.

Even if the District is authorized to assess its property, the City contends that the assessment is fundamentally flawed. On appeal, this court limits its review to the record before the Board and evaluates the propriety of the assessment process, not the merits of the Board's decision. <italic>Doolittle v. City of Everett</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Wn.2d 88</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>93</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>786 P.2d 253</cross_reference>
(1990). An assessment against property located within a local improvement district is presumed to be legal and proper and will be upheld unless the basis for a final assessment roll was fundamentally wrong or the assessing body reached its decision arbitrarily or capriciously.<italic>Abbenhaus v. City of Yakima</italic>, <cross_reference>89 Wn.2d 855</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>860-61</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>576 P.2d 888</cross_reference> (1978);<italic>In re Indian Trail Trunk Sewer</italic>, <cross_reference>35 Wn. App. 840</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>841</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>670 P.2d 675</cross_reference>
(1983). This court also presumes that (1) the improvements are a benefit; (2) the assessment is not greater than the benefit; (3) assessments of other similarly situated property are equal or ratable to the assessment in question; and (4) the assessment is fair. <italic>Doolittle</italic>,<cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 93</cross_reference>. Assessments are based on a determination of the special benefits to each parcel of property resulting from the local improvement. <italic>Doolittle</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 103-04</cross_reference>. The degree to which a property specially benefits from an improvement is measured by the difference between the fair market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the improvement. <italic>Doolittle</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 93</cross_reference>;<italic>In re Local Improvement No. 6097, City of Seattle</italic>, <cross_reference>52 Wn.2d 330</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>333</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>324 P.2d 1078</cross_reference> (1958). Generally, fair market value means the amount a willing purchaser would pay to a willing owner/seller, taking into consideration all reasonable potential uses of the property. <italic>Local</italic><italic>Improvement 6097</italic>, <cross_reference>52 Wn.2d at 333-34</cross_reference>. Present use should be considered, as well as future use to which the property is reasonably well adapted.<italic>In re Jones</italic>, <cross_reference>52 Wn.2d 143</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>146</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>324 P.2d 259</cross_reference> (1958); <italic>In re West Marginal</italic><italic>Way</italic>, <cross_reference>112 Wn. 418</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>422</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>192 P. 961</cross_reference> (1920).

The Board's determination of the special benefit to the City's parcels from installing sewers was based on the current zoning and the highest and best use within that zoning classification. The City's two adjacent parcels are both zoned for single-family residences. Both parcels are approximately 21,000 square feet. One parcel is undeveloped. Without a sewer connection, the property could support only one structure, but with the improvements the best and highest use of the property would allow it to be divided into two 10,000 sq. ft. parcels. The special benefits to the property, after deducting the costs to short plat, were $30,000. The property was assessed $19, 554.56. There is a small house on the other parcel. Although this parcel is also large enough to subdivide, division of the parcel was speculative given City regulations. The highest and best use was as a single family residence with an above average lot size with redevelopment potential. The property was specially benefited in the amount of $15,000 and the Board levied an assessment of $9,777.28.

The City argues that under Doolittle v. Everett, the District was required to consider non-market factors in its assessment, specifically, the City's plans to use the parcels as a neighborhood park without restroom facilities. However, Doolittle did not address the issue presented in this case. In Doolittle, the Court considered whether the City of Everett, in levying assessments for a street improvement, properly treated four lots as a single parcel.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Doolittle looked to the "larger parcel test" of eminent domain law to decide whether the lots should be combined into one tract for purposes of assessment. <italic>Doolittle</italic><cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 96</cross_reference>. After reviewing cases from other jurisdictions, the Court concluded that the better approach was not to consider possible future integrated use. <italic>Doolittle</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 100</cross_reference>.

The City relies on the following portion of the Court's opinion for its argument that the District was required to consider its desire to use the properties it purchased as a park:

<block_quote>  . . . we express a note of caution to experts who apply the concept of future highest and best use in establishing special benefits in an assessment proceeding. Potential highest and best use in an assessment proceeding is premised upon a different foundation than in a condemnation proceeding. In a condemnation the government is taking or damaging property regardless of the consent or wishes of the owner. Usually the taking or damaging is permanent. The owner is deprived of or damaged in not only present use, but every future use, including future adaptation to highest and best use as dictated by the market. Therefore, the law permits compensation for the loss of that future opportunity.</block_quote>

Conversely, an owner who is assessed for LID improvements based upon potential highest and best use is forced to pay an assessment on a valuation which may or may not become a reality. Many factors, other than the market, influence the actual and potential use of any parcel of real estate. Not the least of those nonmarket factors are personal considerations and familial relationships, plus the ever-present tax consequences. When the governmental unit assesses its LID charges on a theoretical, compared to existing use, it is forcing the owner to pay on the basis of what an expert says the owner should do with his property.

These facts must be considered in an assessment proceeding in application of the principle that future use to which property is reasonably adapted within a reasonably foreseeable time may be considered. <italic>Doolittle</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 105-106</cross_reference>.

The "note of caution" in Doolittle applies when the determination of highest and best use is based on theoretical future use and the appraiser disregards existing property use. The decision confirms the principle that an expert's prediction of future highest and best use must be reasonable and cannot be based on speculation. <italic>See In re Westlake Ave</italic>., <cross_reference>40 Wn. 144</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>150</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>82 P. 279</cross_reference> (1905). In this case, the assessment was based on the existing use of the properties. Unlike Doolittle, each parcel was appraised separately based on its current use as two separate parcels. And although the Board determined that the highest and best use of one of the City's parcels was to subdivide, this future use was not speculative because the property was undeveloped and the building code would permit subdivision.

In fact, Doolittle directly addresses the appropriate consideration to be given to the City's intent to devote the property to a use which will not benefit from the sewer connection. The Doolittle Court reaffirmed the established principle that "[p]roperty cannot be relieved from the burden of a local improvement district assessment simply because the owner devotes it to a use which may not be specially benefited by the local improvement." <italic>Doolittle</italic>, <cross_reference>114 Wn.2d at 93</cross_reference>. Doolittle does not mandate consideration of the City's future intent to use the property it purchased for a park. The assessment was not grounded on a fundamentally wrong or flawed basis.

Finally, the City challenges the assessment based on the Board's failure to make a finding regarding its method of assessment. RCW <cross_reference>35.44.030</cross_reference>
and <cross_reference>35.44.040</cross_reference> provide a method for computing the special benefits conferred to properties being assessed. RCW <cross_reference>35.44.047</cross_reference> allows cities to use other methods or combinations of methods to compute assessments if the alternative methods more fairly reflect the special benefits being conferred.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> This provision also states that the failure to make a finding regarding the decision to use a non-statutory method of assessment "shall not invalidate the use of any other method or methods of assessment." The City cites Time Oil Co. v. Port Angeles,<cross_reference>42 Wn. App. 473</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>712 P.2d 311</cross_reference> (1985), in support of its argument that the Board failed to comply with this statute. In <italic>Time Oil</italic>, the court held that while RCW <cross_reference>35.44</cross_reference> does not require a formal determination that one method of assessment is more fair than another, "some evidence must appear in the record from which a reviewing court can conclude that this determination has been made." <italic>Time Oil</italic>, <cross_reference>42 Wn. App. at 478</cross_reference>. This court later concluded that Time Oil was an "inexplicable expansion of the plain terms of the statute", and therefore "must be read narrowly, at best".<italic>Hansen v. LID No. 335</italic>, <cross_reference>54 Wn. App. 257</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>261-62</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>773 P.2d 436</cross_reference> (1989). Even if a city is required to make a record demonstrating that it considered the merits of using a particular method of assessment, only slight evidence is necessary to meet this requirement. <italic>Hansen</italic>,<cross_reference>54 Wn. App. at 262-63</cross_reference>. In <italic>Hansen</italic>, evidence that a property owner who supported the LID stated that the square footage method had been proven over time to be the "`most equitable'" was sufficient. <italic>Hansen</italic>,<cross_reference>54 Wn. App. at 262</cross_reference>.

In this case, at a public hearing held by the Board, the District's counsel explained that the special benefits method was chosen over other methods because the District concluded that assessment based on specific benefits rather than size was appropriate. As in Hansen, this record is sufficient to demonstrate that the District made the determination that the special benefits method was more fair.

Affirmed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> A 1960 opinion of the State Attorney General's Office explains that while there is no constitutional bar to assessments by municipal corporations against state property, this statute reflects Washington's adoption of the rule followed by the majority of jurisdictions requiring express legislative permission to assess state property. 1960 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 161. A subsequent 1972 opinion of the State Attorney General's office, notes that the rule requiring specific legislative authority to subject state-owned land to assessment "does not appear to be applicable in the case of municipally-owned lands." 1972 Op.
