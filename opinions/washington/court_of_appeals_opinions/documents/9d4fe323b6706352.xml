<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Jeffrey Reinert appeals from his conviction for one count of first degree arson. The State concedes that the amended information was constitutionally deficient because it failed to allege that Reinert damaged a `dwelling,' an essential element of the offense. See<cross_reference>9A.48.020</cross_reference>(1)(b). We accept the State's concession.

Accordingly, Reinert's conviction is reversed and the matter remanded for dismissal without prejudice. See State v. Simon, <cross_reference>120 Wn.2d 196</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>199</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>840 P.2d 172</cross_reference> (1992). Reversed and remanded. FOR THE COURT:

GROSSE and COX, JJ., concur.
