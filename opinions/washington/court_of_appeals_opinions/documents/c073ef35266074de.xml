<opinion_text><unpublished>  An easement over a road and bridge on property belonging to appellants Buerki provides access to parts of property belonging to respondents Swanson. The trial court quieted title to the easement in the Swansons, and ordered the Buerkis to remove a gate across the easement. Finding no ambiguity in the grant of easement, and no issue of material fact with respect to the removal of the gate, we affirm both decisions.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
In 1975, Floyd Klinkenberg and his son Jerry Klinkenberg purchased a large parcel of land bordered by Bear Creek Road to the west, and Bear Creek Country Club to the east. Bear Creek runs north to south through the property. An access road runs west from Bear Creek Road along the north border of the property and includes a bridge where the access road spans Bear Creek. The Klinkenbergs used the bridge to access their land east of the creek.

In 1977, the Klinkenbergs short platted the property into two parcels. Floyd quitclaimed Parcel 2, the eastern parcel, to Jerry in October 1984.

In 1987, Floyd subdivided Parcel 1 the western parcel into four lots.

In June 1988, Floyd conveyed the newly created Lot 4 to Jerry. A portion of Lot 4 is on the east side of Bear Creek.

In December 1988, Jerry Klinkenberg conveyed to the Hillmans, by statutory warranty deed, the north 30 feet and the east 400 feet of Parcel 2. The north 30 feet of Parcel 2 is a strip of land 1,600 feet long, constituting a `panhandle' driveway attached to a lot that is otherwise 400 feet wide. The deed stated that the conveyance was `together with and subject to an easement for ingress, egress, and utilities over, under, across, through and upon' the 30 foot wide strip. This strip is the location of the access road and the bridge involved in the present dispute. It provides the only access from the west to the portions of Parcel 2 and Lot 4 east of Bear Creek.

In May 1992, the Hillmans conveyed their property to the Buerkis. In 1993, Jerry Klinkenberg conveyed Lot 4 and the remainder of Parcel 2 back to his father. In October 1993, Floyd Klinkenberg sold Lot 4 and the remainder of Parcel 2 to the Swansons. These conveyances created the present situation, in which the Swansons claim the right to travel down the road on the Buerkis' panhandle in order to reach the parts of their property east of Bear Creek.

In 1992, the Buerkis placed an unlocked gate across the access road on the west side of the bridge. In May 2000, the Swansons sued to quiet title to the easement referred to in the 1988 deed, and to obtain an order for the removal of the gate.

The trial court entered an order of summary judgment in favor of the Swansons, concluding as a matter of law that the 1988 deed reserved an appurtenant access and utilities easement for the property now owned by the Swansons. The trial court also ordered the Buerkis to remove the gate across the access road. This appeal followed.

<center>                               THE EASEMENT.</center>
We review summary judgment rulings de novo, viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Samis Land Co. v. City of Soap Lake, <cross_reference>143 Wn.2d 798</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>803</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>23 P.3d 477</cross_reference>
(2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Samis Land Co., <cross_reference>143 Wn.2d at 803</cross_reference>. An express conveyance of an easement, whether by grant or by reservation, must be accomplished by a written deed. Beebe v. Swerda, <cross_reference>58 Wn. App. 375</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>379</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>793 P.2d 442</cross_reference>
(1990); RCW <cross_reference>64.04.010</cross_reference>. The 1988 deed granting part of Parcel 2 to the Hillmans conveyed The north 30 feet of the east 1600.00 feet of lot 2 of short plat No. 676015 as recorded under recording number 7702170550, in King County, Washington. Also the east 400.00 feet of said lot 2, except the north 30.00 feet thereof, Together with and subject to an easement for ingress, egress, and utilities over, under, across, through and upon the north 30.00 feet of the east 1600.00 feet of said lot 2,. . . .

The Buerkis claim that the `together with and subject to' language renders the deed ambiguous and thereby raises an issue of fact as to whether the deed reserved an easement.

<block_quote>  `No particular words are necessary to constitute a grant, and any words which clearly show the intention to give an easement, which is by law grantable, are sufficient to effect that purpose, providing the language is sufficiently definite and certain in its terms.'</block_quote>

Beebe, <cross_reference>58 Wn. App. at 379</cross_reference>. The words of the 1988 deed clearly show the intention to reserve an easement, and that easement is clearly and definitely described. We hold that the deed unambiguously reserved an easement.

Even assuming that the language of the 1988 deed is ambiguous, it is clear that the parties to that deed intended the reservation of an easement.

When faced with an ambiguity, a court should construe a deed grant in a manner that gives effect to the intent of the parties to the deed. Harris v. Ski Park Farms, Inc., <cross_reference>120 Wn.2d 727</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>739</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>844 P.2d 1006</cross_reference> (1993). A court may consider parol evidence concerning `the situation of the property and of the parties, and the surrounding circumstances at the time the instrument was executed' to resolve the ambiguity. Green v. Lupo,<cross_reference>32 Wn. App. 318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>321</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>647 P.2d 51</cross_reference> (1982).

The Buerkis argue that a number of events and documents arising after the execution of the 1988 deed create a material issue of fact concerning the intent of the parties. As that evidence has nothing to do with the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 1988 deed, we have disregarded it.

The intent of the parties to the 1988 deed is clear. Jerry Klinkenberg testified that he intended to reserve an easement. Reasonable minds could only conclude that the 1988 deed reserved an easement.

The Buerkis alternatively argue that even if an easement existed, Jerry Klinkenberg `abandoned' it by signing a letter to the Hillmans in 1992 in which he stated he is `releasing any and all interest that I have or might have had in your real property, in connection with my sale of that property to you, including the above-referenced access easement.' But Klinkenberg was not discussing the access easement in that letter. He was discussing a proposed golf cart easement that the Hillmans had once agreed to grant Klinkenberg over the north 15 feet of the east 400 feet of their lot.

The Buerkis contend that the 1992 letter is evidence of Klinkenberg's intent to release his interest in the access easement as well as his interest in the golf cart easement. An easement, being a property interest, can only be conveyed by execution of an instrument in deed form that complies with the conveyancing statutes. Kirk v. Tomulty,<cross_reference>66 Wn. App. 231</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>236</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>831 P.2d 792</cross_reference> (1992). The same is true of any written instrument purporting to release an easement. See WSBA Washington Real Property Deskbook ยง 10.6(4) Easements and Licenses 10-28 (1997) (A release is a written deed or grant that returns the easement to the owner of the servient land that must satisfy the same requirements as an instrument creating an easement.). Because the signatures to the 1992 letter were not notarized, the letter had no legal effect and released no easement rights. See RCW <cross_reference>64.04.010</cross_reference>.

The proposed golf cart easement was never recorded. However, Jerry Klinkenberg executed a quitclaim deed in March 1992 in which he relinquished the golf cart easement. The Hillmans asked him to release the golf cart easement at the request of the Buerkis, to facilitate the Buerkis' purchase of Lot 2. The most that a reasonable factfinder could conclude from this evidence is that at one time, Klinkenberg and the Hillmans contemplated a separate golf cart easement.

The Buerkis next contend that if the 1988 deed reserved an easement, it was in gross, or personal to Jerry Klinkenberg, not appurtenant. There is a very strong presumption in Washington that an easement is appurtenant rather than in gross. Olson v. Trippel, <cross_reference>77 Wn. App. 545</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>554</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>893 P.2d 634</cross_reference> (1995). Easements in gross are not favored. Winsten v. Prichard, <cross_reference>23 Wn. App. 428</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>430</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>597 P.2d 415</cross_reference> (1979). `An easement is not in gross when there is anything in the deed or the situation of the property which indicates that it was intended to be appurtenant to land retained or conveyed by the grantor.' Green, <cross_reference>32 Wn. App. at 323</cross_reference>. `Ingress, egress and utilities are purposes which are normally associated with land use rather than personal convenience.' Winsten,<cross_reference>23 Wn. App. at 430-31</cross_reference>. This is especially true where an easement is for utilities. Winsten, <cross_reference>23 Wn. App. at 431</cross_reference>. The easement in the 1988 deed specifically refers to utilities. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that Jerry Klinkenberg intended to reserve an easement in gross. See Olson, <cross_reference>77 Wn. App. at 545</cross_reference>. Reasonable minds could only conclude that the easement reserved by the 1988 deed was appurtenant.

The Buerkis next contend that if an easement exists, it benefits only Parcel 2, not Lot 4. They rely on language in the proposed golf cart easement that it was for the benefit of Parcel 2 of the 1977 short plat. But evidence concerning the scope of the golf cart easement has no bearing on the scope of the access easement created by the 1988 conveyance to the Hillmans. At the time of that conveyance, Jerry Klinkenberg owned Lot 2 and Lot 4. The only access to both lots was then, and is now, over the easement. Reasonable minds could only conclude that Klinkenberg intended the easement to provide access to both lots.

<center>                                  THE GATE</center>
Mr. Buerki erected the gate on the west side of the bridge in 1992. On summary judgment, the court ordered its removal. The Buerkis removed the gate. Soon after, the Buerkis moved to modify the court's order, claiming that incidents of speeding and trespass had increased since removal. The trial court denied the Buerkis' motion but allowed them to install a `dead end' sign to discourage vehicle use of the access road. Also, the trial court stated that the Buerkis could, if they wished, install a gate at the west edge of their 400-foot parcel.

The trial court's removal order constituted injunctive relief. `A suit for an injunction is an equitable proceeding addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, to be exercised according to the circumstances of each case.' Steury v. Johnson, <cross_reference>90 Wn. App. 401</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>405</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>957 P.2d 772</cross_reference> (1998). This court `must give great weight to the trial court's decision, interfering only if it is based on untenable grounds, is manifestly unreasonable or is arbitrary.' Steury, <cross_reference>90 Wn. App. at 405</cross_reference>. Nevertheless, the Buerkis contend there were material issues of fact, precluding the court from deciding on summary judgment that the unlocked gate was unreasonable and had to be removed.

When a servient estate, such as the Buerki property, is being subjected to a greater burden than originally contemplated in the grant of easement, the servient owner has a right to restrict use of an easement by maintaining a gate `in a reasonable fashion necessary for his protection, as long as such gates do not unreasonably interfere with the dominant owner's use.' Rupert v. Gunter, <cross_reference>31 Wn. App. 27</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>31</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>640 P.2d 36</cross_reference> (1982). The determination of the change in circumstances and the balancing of the servient owner's burden and the dominant owner's inconvenience are fact-driven inquiries. Steury, <cross_reference>90 Wn. App. at 406</cross_reference>.

The Buerkis did not submit evidence showing a change of circumstances since the creation of the easement, as the case was in Steury. Indeed, they did not even argue the point. Their response to the Swansons' motion for summary judgment was focused on attempting to demonstrate an issue of fact with respect to the easement and also on disproving any claim by the Swansons to a prescriptive easement. The undisputed evidence showed that the Swansons had enjoyed continuous and open usage of the easement until the Buerkis put the gate up. We conclude there were no material issues of disputed fact raised by the Buerkis that should have precluded the court from including the gate removal order in its initial order granting summary judgment.

The Buerkis then moved for clarification and partial reconsideration of the trial court's summary judgment order. In their motion, the Buerkis requested that the gate be allowed to remain in place pending resolution of the case. The Buerkis cited concerns about the load bearing capacity of the bridge and the need to prevent speeding along the easement. The trial court denied the request. This again was not error, as the Buerkis did not supply evidence of a change in circumstances since the beginning of the easement.

Eight months later, in July 2001, the Buerkis again moved for reconsideration. The Buerkis requested that the court allow reinstallation of the gate where it previously stood. The Buerkis claimed that the gate was necessary to reduce speeding along the easement. They also stated that since the removal of the gate, an increasing number of golfers had trespassed on their property while trying to access the Bear Creek Country Club.

Finally, the Buerkis cited an incident where a large delivery truck had mistakenly driven up to the Buerki home and had experienced difficulty turning around to leave. This evidence did not show a change in circumstances on the easement that would justify reinstallation of the gate. One declaration submitted by the Buerkis at the time of the motion for summary judgment stated that children and golfers had been trespassing on the easement since the time of its creation. As to the allegations of problems with speeding vehicles and delivery trucks, the Buerkis offered no evidence that such problems had increased since the time of the initial creation of the easement. The trial court properly denied the Buerkis' motion for reconsideration.

<center>               PROCEDURAL ISSUES RELATED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT</center>
The Buerkis contend that the trial court erred by not fully considering the declaration of John Lancaster, an attorney in the firm representing the Buerkis. The Buerkis submitted Lancaster's declaration in support of their motion opposing summary judgment. In the declaration, Lancaster explained a number of documents relating to the chains of title to the Swanson and Buerki properties. The Swansons moved to strike the declaration. The trial court denied the motion and instead considered the declaration solely to authenticate the attached exhibits.

A trial court's evidentiary rulings regarding declarations submitted in summary judgment proceedings are reviewed de novo. Folsom v. Burger King, <cross_reference>135 Wn.2d 658</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>663-64</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>958 P.2d 301</cross_reference> (1998). Having examined the Lancaster declaration, we find it does not raise an issue of material fact. In it, Lancaster discussed documents involving parties other than Jerry Klinkenberg and the Hillmans, all executed well after 1988. Because this discussion did not constitute evidence concerning the properties, the parties and the circumstances at the time the 1988 deed was executed, it was not relevant. Lancaster's observations that later deeds conveying the dominant estate failed to refer to the access easement were similarly irrelevant. Easements appurtenant to the dominant estate serve that estate and are a part of it, and are conveyed with the dominant estate as an appurtenance regardless of whether specifically mentioned in the instrument of transfer. See Roggow v. Hagerty, <cross_reference>27 Wn. App. 908</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>913</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>621 P.2d 195</cross_reference> (1980); Cowan v. Gladder, <cross_reference>120 Wn. 144</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>206 P. 923</cross_reference>
(1922).

The Buerkis also contend that the trial court erred when it denied their CR 56(f) motion to continue the summary judgment hearing. A ruling on a CR 56(f) motion for a continuance is reviewed for a manifest abuse of discretion. Morgan v. Peacehealth, Inc., <cross_reference>101 Wn. App. 750</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>774</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>14 P.3d 773</cross_reference> (2000). CR 56(f) `provides a remedy for parties who know of the existence of a material witness and show good reason why they cannot obtain the witness' affidavit in time for the summary judgment proceeding.' Turner v. Kohler, <cross_reference>54 Wn. App. 688</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>693</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>775 P.2d 474</cross_reference>
(1989). A trial court does not abuse its discretion by denying a CR 56(f) motion to continue if:

<block_quote>  `(1) the requesting party does not offer a good reason for the delay in obtaining the desired evidence; (2) the requesting party does not state what evidence would be established through the additional discovery; or (3) the desired evidence will not raise a genuine issue of material fact.'</block_quote>

Turner, <cross_reference>54 Wn. App. at 693</cross_reference>. `A continuance is not justified if the party fails to support the request with an explanation of the evidence to be obtained through additional discovery.' Molsness v. City of Walla Walla,<cross_reference>84 Wn. App. 393</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>400-01</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>928 P.2d 1108</cross_reference> (1997). In Molsness, we affirmed the trial court's decision to deny a continuance where the party stated that additional evidence may be relevant to the issues of the case and did not `explain specifically what evidence would be obtained by additional discovery'. Molsness, <cross_reference>84 Wn. App. at 401</cross_reference>.

The Buerkis' motion similarly claimed that additional evidence `may be critical' to the issues on summary judgment. Like the party in Molsness, the Buerkis failed to explain what evidence additional discovery might produce. The Buerkis also did not explain how deposing the Hillmans might give rise to material issues of fact. The trial court did not abuse its discretion.

Affirmed.
