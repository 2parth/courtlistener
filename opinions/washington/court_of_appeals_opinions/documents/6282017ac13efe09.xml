</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Early one morning, a woman accompanied by Harold Powell checked into a downtown Seattle hotel. Powell was arrested several hours later after he was found in the woman's motor vehicle parked elsewhere and she was found in the hotel hallway bloodied, battered, partially undressed, her hands and feet bound, and pillow cases tied around her neck. At Powell's subsequent jury trial on charges of attempted murder, robbery, and taking a motor vehicle without permission, disputed evidence was presented regarding what actually happened in the hotel room and the severity of the woman's injuries. Powell was found guilty as charged. He appeals, contending for the first time that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by referring to inadmissible hearsay during closing argument.

Because the isolated conduct did not rise to a level where an instruction would not have cured any impropriety, the claim of prosecutorial misconduct has not been properly preserved for our review. Nor do we find any merit to Powell's other claim of sentencing error. Accordingly, we affirm.

One evening, T.K. met Powell as she was leaving a nightclub in downtown Seattle. They eventually drove T.K.'s truck to the Sheraton Hotel, where they checked into a room. Several hours later, Powell left the room with the keys to the truck. But before leaving, Powell bound T.K.'s arms behind her back and ankles with telephone cords and tied two pillow cases around her neck. After freeing her feet, T.K. was able to use her chin to activate a nearby fire alarm. When police officers arrived on the scene, T.K. reported that Powell had beaten, raped, and attempted to kill her. Shortly thereafter, Powell was arrested in T.K.'s vehicle, which was parked several blocks away. Powell was charged with one count of attempted first degree murder, one count of first degree robbery, and one count of taking a motor vehicle without permission.

At Powell's jury trial, T.K. testified that after she and Powell checked into the hotel room he hit her on the back of the head with a bottle and threatened to kill her. T.K. testified that Powell removed much of her clothing, tied her arms and legs with phone cords, tried to strangle her, and dumped the contents of her purse on the floor and took several items including her car keys. T.K. stated that Powell left after she duped him into believing that he had killed her or again rendered her unconscious. Although T.K. had difficulty remembering certain details of the encounter, she positively identified Powell as her attacker. Another hotel resident testified that she heard a woman scream on at least three separate occasions from the room where T.K. and Powell were staying. The State called numerous other witnesses who testified regarding T.K.'s physical, emotional, and medical condition immediately following her ordeal, and statements she made about the incident.

Defense counsel presented expert medical testimony regarding whether T.K. had suffered a skull fracture and whether there was evidence of strangulation. The defense experts testified that there was no physical evidence to support T.K.'s claim that Powell had strangled her.

In closing argument, the prosecutor recounted T.K.'s testimony and the statements she made to various witnesses. The prosecutor argued that if the jurors put all the evidence together, they would get a logical version of the events. Defense counsel virtually conceded that the State had presented evidence sufficient to convict Powell of taking a motor vehicle without permission and the lesser included offense of second degree assault, but argued that the State had failed to prove that Powell had strangled, robbed, or attempted to kill T.K. The jury nevertheless found Powell guilty of attempted first degree murder, first degree robbery, and taking a motor vehicle without permission. The jury also returned a special verdict that the attempted murder count was committed with a sexual motivation. The trial court sentenced Powell to 218 months for the attempted murder with sexual motivation, 57 months for the robbery, and 3 months for the taking of a motor vehicle without permission. The sentence also included a period of post incarceration community custody. The judgment and sentence ordered that Powell would be subject to community custody for '36 to 48 months . . . or for the entire period of earned early release . . . whichever is longer.' This appeal followed.

<center>                                  DECISION</center>
Powell contends that he was denied a fair trial by reason of improper and prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument. He claims the prosecutor engaged in reversible misconduct by referring to matters not in the record. We disagree. `A defendant's right to a fair trial is denied when the prosecutor makes improper comments and there is a substantial likelihood that the comments affected the jury's decision.'<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Where improper argument is alleged, the defendant bears the threshold burden of showing the impropriety of the argument as well as its prejudicial effect.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> If the defendant proves the conduct was improper, the impropriety still does not warrant a new trial unless the reviewing court determines there is a substantial likelihood the misconduct affected the jury's verdict.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Moreover, the failure of a defendant to object to an improper remark constitutes a waiver of the misconduct, unless the impropriety is deemed so flagrant and ill-intentioned that it evinces an enduring and resulting prejudice that could not have been cured by a curative instruction by the court.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> In other words, if the misconduct could have been remedied by a curative instruction, the defendant has not been denied a fair trial.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> Powell contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct when she discussed the testimony of a social worker who was in charge of coordinating medical, social, and support services for T.K. In her closing argument, the prosecutor stated:

<block_quote>  When she talked to the social worker, [T.K.] said she had a severe headache, she was hit in the head. `He was beating me with the phone.' Remember [the social worker] said, `he was strangling, strangling, strangling me.' She said, `I pretended to be unconscious when he went through my purse.' She was bound with the cords, and she had a mark on her neck. Powell argues that the prosecutor misstated the evidence when she remarked that the social worker had testified T.K. said, `I pretended to be unconscious when he went through my purse.' Because the social worker never testified that T.K. told her `he went through [her] purse,' Powell argues the prosecutor misrepresented the social worker's testimony and, therefore, Powell's conviction should be reversed. But Powell failed to either object to the remark, request a curative instruction, or move for a mistrial. And while we agree with Powell that the remark made by the prosecutor was inappropriate,<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> the passing reference was buried in the midst of an otherwise fair characterization of the evidence presented. In addition, the jury was specifically instructed that the attorneys' remarks, statements, and argument were not evidence and to '[d]isregard any remark, statement, or argument that is not supported by the evidence . . . .' The jury is presumed to follow its instructions.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> Because the prosecutor's isolated remark did not rise to the level of being so flagrant or ill-intentioned that it could not have been cured by an instruction, Powell waived his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.</block_quote>

Powell next contends that the term of community custody imposed by the trial court was too imprecise. Citing State v. Nelson,<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> he argues the trial court should have calculated the specific amount of earned early release credit and then recorded the potential maximum period of community custody on the judgment and sentence. This argument is not well taken. In State v. Mitchell,<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> this court recently rejected a similar argument, holding that '[s]uch annotations would make the typical sentence a longer document but not necessarily one that is more definite and certain.'<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

Affirmed.
