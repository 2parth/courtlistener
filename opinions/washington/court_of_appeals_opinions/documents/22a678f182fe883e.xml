<opinion_text><unpublished>  This appeal follows a conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Janie M. Johnston assigns error to the trial court's decision to admit drugs found during a search incident to arrest. The record shows that the police had probable cause to arrest and search Ms. Johnston. She also assigns error to the admission of drug evidence since a proper chain of custody was not established at trial. The police officer's testimony provided an adequate foundation to admit the evidence of drugs. The trial judge did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence of drugs. We therefore affirm the conviction.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
John Hayes worked as a loss prevention officer for a store. He observed two women, Janie Johnston and Karen Quinley. He saw Ms. Johnston open a sealed package of hair dye and empty its contents. She then gave the empty package to Ms. Quinley, who placed it on the shelf. Mr. Hayes watched Ms. Quinley place the contents of the package inside her pocket. Both women left the store.

Mr. Hayes followed them outside and asked them to return. Police arrived at the scene and questioned the women. Ms. Johnston waived her<italic>Miranda</italic><footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> rights. The police asked if she knew why she was being questioned. Ms. Johnston stated that she was with Ms. Quinley who took some items.

Ms. Johnston also told police that she had some "things" in her purse. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 51. The officer asked her what those items were. She answered, "I smoke pot and do meth." RP at 52. The officer asked if there was methamphetamine in her purse. Ms. Johnston replied yes but that it belonged to someone else.

The police officer received information from another officer that there was probable cause to arrest Ms. Johnston for shoplifting. The police arrested Ms. Johnston. And, in a search incident to arrest, they found methamphetamine, marijuana, and a brass smoking pipe in her belongings. The State charged Ms. Johnston with possession of a controlled substance and third degree theft. She moved to suppress the drug evidence prior to trial. Ms. Johnston contended that the police lacked probable cause to arrest her. And the search incident to arrest was therefore illegal. The trial court denied the motion to suppress.

The jury found Ms. Johnston guilty of possession of a controlled substance.

Probable Cause

Ms. Johnston argues that the police lacked probable cause to arrest her. And the fruits of the illegal search should, then, have been suppressed. The State responds that the police officer had probable cause to arrest Ms. Johnston. The necessary information came from the loss prevention officer. He saw Ms. Johnston and her friend. Ms. Johnston assisted her friend in removing items from a hair dye package. And then they left the store without purchasing it.

The loss prevention officer also reported that Ms. Johnston appeared to be more interested in the people around them than the items to be purchased. He interpreted these actions as Ms. Johnston being on the "look out." The State also contends that the police officer had probable cause to believe Ms. Johnston had a controlled substance in her purse because she said she did.

The question of probable cause is a mixed question of law and fact.<italic>State v. Vasquez</italic>, <cross_reference>109 Wn. App. 310</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>318</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>34 P.3d 1255</cross_reference> (2001), <italic>aff'd</italic>,<cross_reference>148 Wn.2d 303</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>59 P.3d 648</cross_reference> (2002). We first review the trial court's factual findings, i.e., the who, what, when, and where, for substantial evidence. <italic>State v. Hill</italic>, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d 641</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>647</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>870 P.2d 313</cross_reference> (1994); <italic>Bokor</italic><italic>v. Dep't of Licensing</italic>, <cross_reference>74 Wn. App. 523</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>526-27</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>874 P.2d 168</cross_reference> (1994). Substantial evidence requires "a sufficient quantity of evidence in the record to persuade a fair-minded, rational person of the truth of the finding." <italic>Hill</italic>, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d at 644</cross_reference>.

We then decide whether the facts support the legal conclusion â€” probable cause. <italic>Vasquez</italic>, <cross_reference>109 Wn. App. at 318</cross_reference>. And this is a legal question that we review de novo. <italic>Id.</italic>

A police officer must have probable cause to arrest. <italic>State v. Potter</italic>,<cross_reference>156 Wn.2d 835</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>840</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>132 P.3d 1089</cross_reference> (2006). Probable cause requires "facts and circumstances, based on reasonably trustworthy information, sufficient to cause a reasonable officer to believe a crime has been committed." <italic>State v. Mance</italic>, <cross_reference>82 Wn. App. 539</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>541</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>918 P.2d 527</cross_reference>
(1996); <italic>State v. Lund</italic>, <cross_reference>70 Wn. App. 437</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>444-45</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>853 P.2d 1379</cross_reference>
(1993).

Here, Ms. Johnston assigns no error to the trial court's findings of fact. They are then verities on appeal. <italic>State v. Rodgers</italic>, <cross_reference>146 Wn.2d 55</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>61</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>43 P.3d 1</cross_reference> (2002). The only question, then, is whether those findings support the trial court's conclusion of probable cause. <italic>Vasquez</italic>,<cross_reference>109 Wn. App. at 318</cross_reference>.

The trial court found that Mr. Hayes was working as a loss prevention officer. Finding of Fact II.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> He saw Ms. Johnston and her friend, Ms. Quinley, at the store. <italic>Id.</italic> He observed Ms. Johnston remove a hair dye package from the store shelf. <italic>Id.</italic> She proceeded to remove the bottle of hair dye from the package and hand it to her friend. <italic>Id.</italic>

Ms. Quinley placed the bottle inside her pocket and left. <italic>Id.</italic> Mr. Hayes believed that Ms. Johnston acted as a look out for her friend since she seemed more interested in the people in her proximity than the merchandise. <italic>Id.</italic> Mr. Hayes confronted Ms. Johnston. She said, ?`I was just with her. She took some things. I didn't know she took them.'" <italic>Id.</italic>

The findings support the trial court's conclusion of probable cause.<italic>Vasquez</italic>, <cross_reference>109 Wn. App. at 318</cross_reference>. The facts would lead a reasonable officer to believe a crime was committed. <italic>Mance</italic>, <cross_reference>82 Wn. App. at 541-42</cross_reference>. The search incident to arrest was, then, also valid. <italic>State v. Balch</italic>,<cross_reference>114 Wn. App. 55</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>63</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>55 P.3d 1199</cross_reference> (2002). Chain of Custody Ms. Johnston next argues that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the drugs into evidence because the State failed to show the chain of custody. The State responds that it laid an adequate foundation for the admission of the illegal substances. And Washington case law does not require an unbroken chain of custody to be shown in order to admit evidence.

We review a trial court's ruling on the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <italic>State v. Darden</italic>, <cross_reference>145 Wn.2d 612</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>619</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>41 P.3d 1189</cross_reference>
(2002). A sufficient foundation to admit evidence may be established even without proof of an unbroken chain of custody. <italic>State v. Picard</italic>,<cross_reference>90 Wn. App. 890</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>897</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>954 P.2d 336</cross_reference> (1998).

?`A failure to present evidence of an unbroken chain of custody does not render an exhibit inadmissible if it is properly identified as being the same object and in the same condition as it was when it was initially acquired by the party.'" <italic>Id.</italic> (quoting <italic>State v. DeCuir</italic>, <cross_reference>19 Wn. App. 130</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>135</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>574 P.2d 397</cross_reference> (1978)).

ER 901(a) states that to admit evidence the requirement of authentication or identification "is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims." ER 901(a). A witness with knowledge regarding the evidence may testify that it is what it claims to be. ER 901(b)(1); <italic>State v. Levy</italic>,<cross_reference>156 Wn.2d 709</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>733</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>132 P.3d 1076</cross_reference> (2006). ER 402 states that relevant evidence is admissible.

The trial judge did not admit the evidence until an adequate foundation had been provided. He required the police officer to give his actual knowledge and understanding of marking the evidence, delivering it to the property room, and properly receiving it. Once this testimony was provided, the trial judge admitted the controlled substance under ER 901 and 402. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion. <italic>Darden</italic>,<cross_reference>145 Wn.2d at 619</cross_reference>.

We affirm the conviction for possession of a controlled substance.

A majority of the panel has determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>.
