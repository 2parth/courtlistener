<opinion_text><unpublished>  Dr. Lew Estabrook appeals from an adverse verdict in this medical malpractice action. He contends that the trial court committed reversible error when it precluded him from rebutting an element of the plaintiff's prima facie case and by excluding a portion of an expert witness's testimony. We disagree and affirm.

<center>                                   Facts</center>
The trial court's findings of fact are unchallenged on appeal. In October 1997, respondent Joyce Herman sought chiropractic treatment from appellant Dr. Lew Estabrook for debilitating migraine headaches associated with her menstrual period. During her first visit, Ms. Herman described her symptoms as `neck and shoulder achiness with periodic headaches lasting one to two days at a time.' Prior to her visit to Dr. Estabrook, Ms. Herman had never sustained any trauma to her neck, received medical care for neck complaints, or given a medical history of neck problems independent of her headaches. Ms. Herman told Dr. Estabrook that she believed her headaches might be hormonally related. Dr. Estabrook informed Ms. Herman that he could help her headache disorder and performed a series of chiropractic manipulations on her spine in October, November, and December 1997. On December 9, 1997, Dr. Estabrook performed a `high velocity, low amplitude chiropractic thrust manipulation' on Ms. Herman's spine.

In the following days, Ms. Herman experienced increasing neck pain and a restricted range of motion, and she was eventually examined by Dr. John Blair, an orthopedic surgeon. On December 18, 1997, an MRI revealed that Ms. Herman had suffered an acute rupture of the C5-6 intervertebral disc.

When Ms. Herman showed signs of increasingly serious spinal cord compression, Dr. Blair performed discectomy and fusion surgery that permanently fused Ms. Herman's C5 and C6 vertebrae. Ms. Herman filed this action against Dr. Estabrook, raising claims of negligence and lack of informed consent. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that Dr. Estabrook's chiropractic manipulation on December 9, 1997, fell below the standard of care required of a reasonably prudent chiropractor and that the manipulation had caused Herman's C5-6 herniation and resulting damages. The court also found that Dr. Estabrook had failed to inform Ms. Herman of material facts related to the proposed chiropractic treatment and that she would not have consented to the high velocity spinal manipulation if she had been informed of the material facts. The court awarded damages of about $280,000.

Dr. Estabrook first contends that the trial court committed reversible error when it precluded him from presenting evidence that Dr. Blair's surgery was unnecessary and unreasonable.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> He maintains that the trial court excluded the proposed testimony after erroneously concluding that it would have constituted evidence of subsequent malpractice.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
Dr. Estabrook argues that the proposed testimony was admissible to rebut an element of Ms. Herman's prima facie case, i.e., that the cost of her subsequent surgery was reasonable and necessary, whether or not his treatment was negligent. But because Dr. Estabrook failed to make an adequate offer of proof or otherwise identify the substance of the proposed testimony, we cannot review the alleged error.

Under ER 103(a)(2), a party cannot challenge a trial court ruling excluding evidence unless `the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.' An offer of proof serves three purposes when the trial court is considering the exclusion of evidence:

<block_quote>  [I]t informs the court of the legal theory under which the offered evidence is admissible; it informs the judge of the specific nature of the offered evidence so that the court can assess its admissibility; and it creates a record adequate for review.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

In his arguments to this court, Dr. Estabrook fails to identify the specific substance of the proposed evidence establishing that Dr. Blair's surgery was unnecessary and unreasonable. Although Dr. Estabrook's briefs contain several references to the proposed testimony in the record, these references involve primarily conclusory assertions in trial briefs and witness disclosure documents. None of the references identifies an adequate offer of proof.

In the lengthy colloquy preceding the trial court's ruling, counsel for Dr. Estabrook reiterated the defense position that Dr. Estabrook was not negligent and that all of Ms. Herman's damages, both special and general, were the result of Dr. Blair's unnecessary surgery. The argument now raised on appeal, that Ms. Herman was not entitled to medical costs because Dr. Blair's surgery was unnecessary, was described only generally, without reference to the substance of the supporting evidence:

<block_quote>  Our position is that Dr. Blair's surgery was unnecessary and unreasonable for him to do, and that [Ms. Herman's] current damages are all related to that surgery, and that Dr. Estabrook was not negligent. . . .</block_quote>

Just briefly. Necessity is the issue. Whether or not this was necessary treatment, and if the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the elements for special damages that they are claiming were both reasonable and necessary, and we should be able to show or at least attempt to show that it was not necessary. It's not a question of the reasonableness of the bill. It was a necessity of that which incurred the bill.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

Contrary to the impression conveyed in Dr. Estabrook's briefs, the trial court's ruling permitted Dr. Estabrook to present evidence on his claim that Dr. Blair's unnecessary surgery caused all of Herman's damages:

<block_quote>  I'm going to limit the testimony to that which would prove the theory only in which Dr. Estabrook did nothing to cause the harm, and all of it was caused by some subsequent herniation or exacerbation of the disc problem that happened completely independent of Dr. Estabrook, and that [Ms. Herman's] symptoms were caused by the surgery. I mean, that's really as far as we can go with that.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

When counsel for Dr. Estabrook sought clarification for whether he `could still discuss with Dr. Blair the impact of a fusion in terms of creating pain or not when you say the symptoms,' the trial court explained:

<block_quote>  [I]f the plaintiff is arguing that . . . the only possible explanation for her problems are that Dr. Estabrook did something to her you can certainly bring in testimony that shows an alternate explanation for why she is suffering symptoms.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

Because the substance of the proposed testimony was not set forth in an adequate offer of proof and is otherwise not apparent from the parties' arguments, we cannot ascertain whether the evidence would have been excluded by the trial court's ruling. Nor can Dr. Estabrook demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the trial court ruling. Accordingly, the alleged error is not preserved for appellate review.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

Dr. Estabrook next contends that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Roy Steinberg, on the issue of causation. Dr. Steinberg, a chiropractor, testified that Dr. Estabrook had not violated the relevant standard of care during his treatment of Ms. Herman. When Dr. Steinberg began to testify about Ms. Herman's injuries, counsel for Ms. Herman objected, arguing that Dr. Steinberg had not been disclosed as a witness on causation. After reviewing four witness disclosure documents, the trial court agreed and excluded Dr. Steinberg's testimony on causation. The trial court based its ruling on King County Local Rule 26(e), which provides that `Any person not disclosed in compliance with this rule may not be called to testify at trial, unless the Court orders otherwise for good cause and subject to such conditions as justice requires.'<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>

Dr. Estabrook argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Steinberg's testimony on causation because the witness disclosure description was sufficiently broad to notify Ms. Herman that his opinion encompassed causation<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> and because Ms. Herman was expressly advised at Dr. Steinberg's deposition that he would testify on causation. Dr. Estabrook further contends that the trial court erred in excluding the witness's testimony without considering lesser sanctions and without making a finding that any incomplete witness disclosure was willful.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

We do not decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in excluding a portion of Dr. Steinberg's testimony under KCLR 26(e) because the error, if any, was harmless. According to Dr. Estabrook, Dr. Steinberg would have testified (1) that Dr. Estabrook could not have caused the herniated disc because he manipulated C2-3 rather than C5-6; (2) that Dr. Estabrook's manipulation did not involve sufficient force to cause the injury; and (3) that if Dr. Estabrook's manipulation had caused the injury, Ms. Herman would have experienced pain immediately, rather than several days later. But Dr. Estabrook also called Dr. Stanley Herring as an expert on causation. Dr. Herring, a podiatrist and spine disorder specialist, testified that the high velocity, low amplitude manipulation that Dr. Estabrook performed on Ms. Herman at C2-3 lacked sufficient force to cause a herniation at C5-6 or to aggravate a preexisting asymptomatic disc herniation. In addition, Dr. Herring explained that a disc can herniate without a traumatic event and concluded that the delay in the onset of Ms. Herman's symptoms indicated the absence of a traumatic event. Consequently, Dr. Steinberg's testimony on causation would have been cumulative to that provided by Dr. Herring. Moreover, Dr. Steinberg testified at length on the issue of whether Dr. Estabrook's treatment complied with the appropriate standard of care, and the trial court obviously rejected his conclusions. Under the circumstances, there is no reasonable likelihood that exclusion of Dr. Steinberg's testimony on causation affected the outcome of the trial. Any error was therefore harmless.<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference>
