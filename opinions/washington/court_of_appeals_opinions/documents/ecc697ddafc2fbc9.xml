<opinion_text><unpublished>  Ronald McComb appeals his conviction and sentence for second degree assault, domestic violence, with a deadly weapon enhancement. He argues that the trial court made evidentiary and instructional errors and improperly sentenced him as a persistent offender. We affirm.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>
On the afternoon of February 6, 2005, McComb was arguing with his wife, Amy. She became angry with him because he was using her haircutting scissors to cut his tobacco. He threw the scissors at her and she threw them back at him; both missed. He then smirked at her, frightening her.

Amy ran into their daughter's room crying. McComb followed her. She tried to prevent him from coming into the room, but he eventually forced the door open. He then kicked Amy in the side of her face while she was sitting on the floor. Still sitting on the floor, she started kicking him in the legs.

After kicking Amy, McComb moved into the living room and she followed. She told him she was packing her things and leaving. He told her she was not taking his children.

Amy went into the bedroom. McComb followed and grabbed her by the hair, causing her to fall to her knees. He then held a knife to her neck and told her he would kill her if she tried to take his children away from him. The serrated edge of the knife blade touched her neck.

Amy did not struggle as McComb held the knife to her throat. Instead, she pushed her neck onto the blade and said, "Go ahead." 1 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 459. He let her go, and she crawled away.

About an hour later, Amy left the apartment and called a friend from a neighbor's home. Amy eventually returned to the McComb residence.

Shortly after Amy returned home, police officers arrived in response to a report of possible domestic violence involving a knife. McComb opened the door to police, and one officer saw Amy with a cut on her neck and crying. The officers arrested McComb.

During a search of the residence, one officer found a knife with what appeared to be dried blood on it. It later tested positive for blood. A forensic scientist also tested the knife for latent fingerprints. He found only one print and concluded that it was McComb's thumbprint.

Between the time of his arrest on February 6, and sometime around February 14, McComb called Amy from the Cowlitz County Jail 265 times. Corrections officers at the Cowlitz County jail recorded these telephone calls.

At trial, over defense objection, the trial court allowed the State to read into evidence selected portions of transcripts of McComb's calls to Amy. Those portions revealed that McComb told Amy to burn her statement and tell prosecutors that (1) she had previously lied about what had happened, (2) there was no knife, (3) she would refuse to testify if called, and (4) she would lie if forced to testify.

At the close of trial, McComb requested the jury be instructed on third degree assault as a lesser included offense of second degree assault. The trial court denied the request.

The jury found McComb guilty of second degree assault. The jury also returned two special verdicts, finding that he committed the assault while armed with a deadly weapon and that he was family or a household member of the victim.

At sentencing, the trial court took into account McComb's previous criminal history, including a 1988 Washington conviction of second degree assault and a 1991 Washington conviction of second degree robbery. Based on McComb's prior convictions, the trial court found that McComb was a persistent offender under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), chapter <cross_reference>9.94A</cross_reference> RCW, and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(32) (formerly (33)) (a); RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.570</cross_reference>.

McComb appeals.

<center>                                ANALYSIS</center><center>                   Lesser Included Offense Instruction</center>
McComb first contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on third degree assault. He asserts that third degree assault is a lesser included offense of second degree assault.

A defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense if (1) each of the elements is a necessary element of the charged offense (legal prong), and (2) the evidence supports an inference that the defendant committed the lesser offense (factual prong). State v. Berlin, <cross_reference>133 Wn.2d 541</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>545-46</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>947 P.2d 700</cross_reference> (1997). To satisfy the factual prong, "the evidence must raise an inference that only the lesser included . . . offense was committed to the exclusion of the charged offense." State v. Fernandez-Medina, <cross_reference>141 Wn.2d 448</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>455</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>6 P.3d 1150</cross_reference> (2000). A mere possibility that the jury might disbelieve the State's evidence is not justification for a lesser included offense instruction. State v. Pettus, <cross_reference>89 Wn. App. 688</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>700</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>951 P.2d 284</cross_reference> (1988).

A person is guilty of second degree assault if he, "under circumstances not amounting to assault in the first degree . . . [a]ssaults another with a deadly weapon." RCW <cross_reference>9A.36.021</cross_reference>(1)(c). Three forms of assault are recognized: (1) assault by actual battery, (2) assault by attempting to inflict bodily injury while having the present ability to do so, and (3) assault by placing the victim in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm. State v. Hall, <cross_reference>104 Wn. App. 56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>63</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>14 P.3d 884</cross_reference> (2000).

A person is guilty of third degree assault if he, "under circumstances not amounting to assault in the first or second degree . . . [w]ith criminal negligence, causes bodily harm to another person by means of a weapon or other instrument or thing likely to produce bodily harm." RCW <cross_reference>9A.36.031</cross_reference>(1)(d). A deadly weapon is an instrument which, under the circumstances used, would be readily capable of causing death or substantial bodily harm. RCW <cross_reference>9A.04.110</cross_reference>(6).

Here, McComb took a serrated kitchen knife to the bedroom where he held the serrated edge to Amy's throat, placing her in apprehension of bodily injury. No evidence pointed to McComb's acting with criminal negligence rather than with intent when he held the knife to Amy's throat. McComb's argument fails.

<center>                           Petrich Instruction</center>
McComb further contends that the trial court erred in failing to give a Petrich instruction to ensure the jury unanimously agreed as to which of his acts constituted second degree assault. State v. Petrich, <cross_reference>101 Wn.2d 566</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>569</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>683 P.2d 173</cross_reference> (1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Kitchen, <cross_reference>110 Wn.2d 403</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>756 P.2d 105</cross_reference> (1988).

When facts show two or more criminal acts that could constitute a crime charged, the jury must unanimously agree on the same act to convict the defendant. Petrich, <cross_reference>101 Wn.2d at 569</cross_reference>. Therefore, the State must elect the specific criminal act on which it is relying for conviction, or the trial court must instruct the jury that all the jurors must agree that the State proved the same underlying criminal act beyond a reasonable doubt. Kitchen,<cross_reference>110 Wn.2d at 411</cross_reference>.

The rule does not apply where the evidence indicates a continuing offense. State v. Handran, <cross_reference>113 Wn.2d 11</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>17</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>775 P.2d 453</cross_reference> (1989). To determine whether a continuing offense occurred, we evaluate the facts in a commonsense manner and consider (1) the time elapsed between the criminal acts and (2) whether the different acts involved the same parties, the same location, and the same ultimate purpose. Handran, <cross_reference>113 Wn.2d at 17</cross_reference>.

Here, McComb kicked Amy and put a knife to her throat in the same location within a short period of time with the ultimate purpose of preventing her from removing his children. The evidence shows that McComb engaged in a continuing offense. Accordingly, no Petrich instruction was necessary here.

<center>                         Washington Privacy Act</center>
Next, McComb contends that the trial court erred in admitting transcripts of his telephone calls to Amy. He asserts that the State did not prove that both parties consented to the recordings.

We will not disturb the trial court's sound discretion in admitting evidence absent a showing of abuse. State v. Stubsjoen,<cross_reference>48 Wn. App. 139</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>147</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>738 P.2d 306</cross_reference> (1987). A trial court abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on untenable grounds or reasons. State v. Flinn, <cross_reference>154 Wn.2d 193</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>199</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>110 P.3d 748</cross_reference> (2005).

Washington's Privacy Act, chapter <cross_reference>9.73</cross_reference> RCW, makes recording private telephone communications unlawful "without first obtaining the consent of all participants in the communication." RCW <cross_reference>9.73.030</cross_reference>(1)(a). The Cowlitz County jail records all inmate "phone calls out," and an automated message advises the inmate that the jail will record the calls. 3 RP at 392. In order to continue, the inmate must agree by pressing "one." 3 RP at 394. A similar message greets one who receives the telephone call. The party answering must also consent by pressing "one" in order to continue the call. 3 RP at 394.

Here, because the calls were completed, the trial court determined that McComb and Amy consented to the calls being recorded and properly admitted the transcripts.

<center>                   1988 Conviction as a Strike Offense</center>
McComb also contends that the trial court erred in classifying him as a persistent offender. RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference> defines a "persistent offender" as one whom the State has convicted of any felony the State considers a "most serious offense" on at least three separate occasions. RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(32) (formerly (33)) (a)(i), (ii). RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(28) (formerly (29)) (b) and (o) define second degree assault and second degree robbery as "most serious" offenses.

In 1988, McComb pleaded guilty to second degree assault for firing a loaded pistol at two people. In 1991, McComb pleaded guilty to second degree robbery. McComb does not dispute his convictions. Instead, he argues that with regard to the 1988 crime, the current elements of second degree assault currently differ from those in 1988. Therefore, he argues that we must engage in the same comparison analysis that we would for an out of state conviction. We disagree and decline to do so because in 1988, McComb pleaded guilty to a Washington felony involving a deadly weapon, a most serious offense for purposes of the POAA. RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(28) (formally (29)) (b). His argument fails.

<center>              Persistent Offender Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</center>
McComb also contends that the trial court erred in sentencing him to life without the possibility of parole absent the State proving his prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt.

For the trial court to sentence McComb as a persistent offender under the POAA, the State needed to prove two prior convictions of "most serious offenses" "by a preponderance of the evidence, not . . . beyond a reasonable doubt." See State v. Manussier,<cross_reference>129 Wn.2d 652</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>682</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>921 P.2d 473</cross_reference> (1996). This sentencing scheme does not conflict with Blakely, which provides, "`Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.'" Blakely v. Washington, <cross_reference>542 U.S. 296</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>301</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>124 S. Ct. 2531</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>159 L. Ed. 2d 403</cross_reference>
(2004) (emphasis added) (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey,<cross_reference>530 U.S. 466</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>490</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>120 S. Ct. 2348</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>147 L. Ed. 2d 435</cross_reference> (2000)).

McComb incorrectly asserts that Blakely requires the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a persistent offender.<cross_reference>542 U.S. at 301</cross_reference>. Because the POAA is neither an exceptional sentencing statute subject to a Blakely analysis nor an enhanced sentence statute, his argument fails. State v. Ball,<cross_reference>127 Wn. App. 956</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>957</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>113 P.3d 520</cross_reference> (2005), review denied, <cross_reference>156 Wn.2d 1018</cross_reference>
(2006).

<center>                        Constitutionality of POAA</center>
Finally, McComb contends that the POAA is unconstitutional because it violates the single subject requirement of the Washington State Constitution. We disagree.

Article II, section 19 of the Washington State Constitution states, "No bill shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title." The purposes of this provision are to "(1) prevent `logrolling,' or pushing legislation through by attaching it to other necessary or desirable legislation, and (2) assure that the members of the legislature and the public are generally aware of what is contained in proposed new laws." State v. Thorne, <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d 736</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>757</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>921 P.2d 514</cross_reference> (1996).

The POAA contains two distinct subjects: "(1) provisions for life imprisonment for three-time `persistent offenders' convicted of most serious offenses, and (2) provisions making certain other offenders ineligible during mandatory minimum terms for any form of early release." Thorne, <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d at 757</cross_reference>.

McComb asserts that the entire statute is unconstitutional because of these two subjects. Our Supreme Court addressed this argument in Thorne, noting that the ballot title of the POAA contained only one subject: "Shall criminals who are convicted of `most serious offenses' on three occasions be sentenced to life in prison without parole?" Thorne, <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d at 757</cross_reference>. Thus, the Court determined that title is restrictive and "the provisions which are not fairly within it will not be given force." Thorne,<cross_reference>129 Wn.2d at 758</cross_reference>. Following Thorne, "[t]he ballot title to [the POAA] contains only one subject, persistent offenders; hence, any provisions in the law which relate to that subject are valid under article II, section 19." <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d at 758</cross_reference>. McComb's argument fails.

Affirmed.

A majorityofthe panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.

But McComb did not dispute that he was the person twice convicted of two prior "most serious offenses" and Blakely does not require that a defendant's prior convictions be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <cross_reference>542 U.S. at 301</cross_reference>. Because McComb did not dispute facts which Blakely requires be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, I concur in the result.
