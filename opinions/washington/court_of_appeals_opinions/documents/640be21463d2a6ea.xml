<opinion_text><unpublished>  Sverre Staurset's law firm sued Carol Lowenthal for defamation. She counterclaimed, alleging that an attorney in the firm had sexually assaulted her. During a brief time when Lowenthal was not represented, Staurset met with her in his office and the two signed a stipulation dismissing their respective claims. A judge signed the stipulation and order of dismissal. Lowenthal then retained a new lawyer, who moved to vacate the judgment, claiming that Lowenthal, who has a long history of mental illness, lacked capacity to sign the release. The trial court vacated the judgment, and Staurset appeals. We affirm.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
Carol Lowenthal volunteered at Sverre Staurset's law firm as part of her paralegal training. Staurset and his partner, Michael Adams, say they fired Lowenthal because she tried to look at confidential information. But Lowenthal says she quit because Adams sexually assaulted her. When the law firm sued Lowenthal for defamation, she counterclaimed for sexual assault.

Lowenthal suffers from longstanding psychological problems, including multiple personality disorder. She has received regular treatment since 1986, and the Social Security Administration has declared her permanently disabled. Throughout the legal proceedings, Staurset and Adams characterized Lowenthal as mentally disturbed and incompetent. They obtained a protection order against her, supported by expert testimony that Lowenthal's phone messages to Adams suggested `serious psychopathology, to wit, [b]orderline personality disorder, characterized by intense and unstable emotionality and interpersonal relationships, inappropriate and intense anger, marked impulsivity, threatening behavior, and frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.' CP at 219-20. They also supported the order with Adams' declaration that her behavior was `increasingly threatening and unstable' and `very frightening and extremely bizarre.' CP at 238.

One of Lowenthal's identified multiple personalities is `Blanche.' During her deposition, Adams' counsel addressed her as `Blanche' because he thought she was experiencing an altered personality. CP at 145-46. Lowenthal's original counsel withdrew on March 20, 2000.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Lowenthal's present counsel filed a notice of appearance for March 21, 2000.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> In the meantime, on March 20, 2000, Lowenthal appeared pro se. Between March 16 and March 20, Staurset called Lowenthal several times until she agreed to meet him in his office. Staurset and his associate, Stephen Oelrich, met with Lowenthal on March 20 and the parties agreed to dismiss the charges against each other. Lowenthal later implied in her declaration that she does not remember the meeting. She said that later in the day, while at the hospital for migraine treatment, she `found out [she] had signed papers which dropped [her] case against Staurset and Adams.' CP at 155.

Staurset presented the Stipulation and Order of Dismissal to a judge on March 20, and the judge signed the order. Lowenthal's new counsel then moved to vacate the dismissal under CR 60(b), stressing Lowenthal's unsound mind and incapacity to stipulate to a dismissal. A visiting judge from Kitsap County Superior Court granted the motion and vacated the judgment, pointing to Lowenthal's medical history, the guardianship, and Social Security's determination that she was permanently disabled. The court also relied on Staurset and Adams' own expert's testimony that Lowenthal was mentally unstable, and the way Adams' counsel treated Lowenthal in her deposition. These facts, said the court, `indicate that Ms. Lowenthal was not competent to enter the settlement agreement, that Mr. Staurset knew of Ms. Lowenthal's condition, and that her condition was not a part of the record when the Order of Dismissal was granted.' CP at 501.

<center>                                  ANALYSIS</center>
Staurset argues that Lowenthal did not present clear and convincing evidence that she was mentally unsound when she signed the release. At oral argument, Staurset also claimed that he was entitled to a hearing with sworn testimony as to Lowenthal's disability. Because of these problems, according to Staurset, the trial court erred in vacating the stipulated judgment.

We review a trial court's order vacating a judgment for manifest abuse of discretion. In re Guardianship of Adamec, <cross_reference>100 Wn.2d 166</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>173</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>667 P.2d 1085</cross_reference> (1983). The trial court abuses its discretion if no reasonable person would take the position it adopted. In re Marriage of Burkey, <cross_reference>36 Wn. App. 487</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>489</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>675 P.2d 619</cross_reference> (1984).

The trial court vacated the judgment here based on CR 60(b) and CR 60(b)(2): `[T]he court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding . . . [f]or erroneous proceedings against a minor or person of unsound mind, when the condition of such defendant does not appear in the record, nor the error in the proceedings[.]' CR 60(b), (b)(2). Staurset does not dispute that he knew of Lowenthal's condition and that the court granting the dismissal did not know of her condition. But he claims that she was competent to sign the settlement agreement. Everyone is presumed sane. Page v. Prudential Life Ins. Co. of Am.,<cross_reference>12 Wn.2d 101</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>109</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>120 P.2d 527</cross_reference> (1942). A person must overcome this presumption by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Page,<cross_reference>12 Wn.2d at 109</cross_reference>. A person has sufficient mental capacity to enter into a contract when she `possesses sufficient mind to understand, in a reasonable manner, the nature and effect of the act in which [she] is engaged.' Page, <cross_reference>12 Wn.2d at 108</cross_reference> (citation omitted).<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

A person's capacity is a factual issue. Page, <cross_reference>12 Wn.2d at 109</cross_reference>. Staurset has culled the record and now presents to us the evidence in support of his argument. He points to evidence that Lowenthal participated in other lawsuits at the same general time she signed the stipulation. She even represented herself pro se in one matter, and argued a motion before the superior court. And, Staurset notes, neither Lowenthal's former attorney in this case, nor her attorney in a concurrent case, got a guardian ad litem to protect Lowenthal's interests. But in making this argument, Staurset misperceives our task.

We do not review the record for evidence that would support a decision contrary to the trial court's decision. Rather, we review the record to determine if there is evidence to support the trial court's decision. Here, the trial court had evidence that Lowenthal has been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and has received ongoing treatment for it. She has been treated extensively with medications, and she was likely medicated when she signed the release. She has needed a guardian ad litem in the past. The Social Security Administration has found her totally and permanently disabled. Staurset's own expert said that Lowenthal had borderline personality disorder, was intense and unstable emotionally, and showed serious psychopathology. Adams' lawyer treated Lowenthal as if she were experiencing a lapse into a different personality during her deposition and addressed her as `Blanche,' one of her other personalities. CP at 145. Lowenthal reported that she did not recall signing the release and that she would not have understood what she was signing. This evidence adequately supports the trial court's decision to vacate the stipulated judgment.

Finally, at oral argument, Staurset claimed that the trial court should have held a hearing with sworn testimony. Staurset, however, neither assigned error to nor argued in his brief the court's failure to conduct a hearing. We decline to consider the argument. RAP 10.3.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.

We concur: Bridgewater, J., Hunt, J.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Staurset thought counsel withdrew effective March 14. The notice was dated March 14, but effective March 20.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Though counsel filed the notice of appearance, the clerk rejected it because the case had already been dismissed by the entry of the release and judgment. Staurset claims he did not get the notice until June 6, 2000.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> Staurset quotes a passage from Page stating that a party must also show that her unsound mind made her unable to reasonably perceive or understand the contract. But the civil rule says that the court may vacate a judgment when the person shows she was of unsound mind and this condition did not appear in the record. CR 60(b). This rule, enacted after the decision in Page, supercedes Page; Staurset's reliance on this part of Page is incorrect.</footnote_body>
