</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Adam Zuehlke appeals from his conviction for two counts of possession of a controlled substance. Zuehlke was stopped and frisked by police while walking in a high crime area at 3 a.m. The police were investigating a recent report of suspected car prowling, and Zuehlke was carrying items commonly stolen out of cars. Although the items did not turn out to be stolen, police found drugs on Zuehlke during a protective frisk. We hold that the police were justified in performing a brief investigatory stop and a frisk for weapons. But we reverse because the police exceeded the permissible scope of a weapons frisk when they opened a plastic prescription medication bottle without any articulable suspicion that a weapon was inside.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
On May 2, 2001, Bellingham Police Officer Dennis James was advised by dispatch that two males were seen in the 700 block alley between Garden and Forest Streets "looking into vehicles." Officer James testified that this area of town, which was near a university, was a high crime area for vehicle prowls. James was on a vehicle prowl detail at the time of the incident, and he testified that there were almost 2,000 vehicle prowls in 2001. He also testified that in his experience, most vehicle prowlers carried tools for breaking into cars that could also be used as weapons. He also testified to two instances that he knew of in which vehicle prowlers carried guns.

Officer James saw Zuehlke and another man walking in the 400 block of Oak Street near an alley. He noticed that Zuehlke was carrying a portable C.D. player and a C.D. case. He testified that CDs are "probably the number one thing taken from vehicle prowls." Officer James, who was in plain clothes and an unmarked car, observed the two men for some time to see if they would do anything suspicious. They did not. He then stopped the two men, identified himself as an officer, and asked them to sit down on the curb. The area was dimly lit. Officer James called for backup and waited until Officer Lowell English arrived.

Officer English arrived within thirty seconds and saw Zuehlke and the other man sitting on the curb. The officers separated the two men, and Officer English took Zuehlke aside to talk to him. Officer English, like Officer James, testified that in his experience, vehicle prowlers carried tools for breaking into cars, many of which could be used as weapons. He also testified that Zuehlke was wearing a large coat that could have concealed weapons. Officer English asked Zuehlke if he had any weapons, and Zuehlke said he did not. Officer English then told Zuehlke he wanted to pat him down, and Zuehlke raised his arms in response. During the frisk, Officer English felt a "hard container" in Zuehlke's rear pants pocket. He pulled the container out and saw that it was a plastic pill bottle.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Officer English testified that he was unable to see inside the bottle until he opened it. Upon opening the container, he discovered that it contained marijuana. Officer English did not testify that the pill container felt like it could be a weapon when he felt it in Zuehlke's back pocket, nor did he testify that he had any reason to believe that the pill container contained a weapon once he removed it from Zuehlke's pocket and saw what it was. Zuehlke stated that the container was not his, and that he was holding it for his friend. After finding the marijuana, Officer English continued frisking Zuehlke. He felt several "hard objects" in Zuehlke's left front pocket and asked what was there. Zuehlke answered "a little crank." Officer English testified that the objects were large enough that at the time, he was concerned they could be weapons. He removed the hard items from Zuehlke's pants and discovered two small metal match holders. The match holders contained methamphetamine wrapped in a clear plastic baggie. Officer James also testified that "at some point" during the encounter, he and Officer English became satisfied that the CDs belonged to Zuehlke. Zuehlke moved to suppress the marijuana and methamphetamine as the fruit of an illegal search. The trial court ruled that the drugs were admissible. Zuehlke was convicted of drug possession after a stipulated trial. This appeal followed.

<center>                                  ANALYSIS</center>
Under the <cross_reference>Fourth</cross_reference> Amendment to the United States Constitution and article <cross_reference>I</cross_reference>, section <cross_reference>7</cross_reference> of the Washington Constitution, warrantless searches and seizures are presumed to be unreasonable. <italic>State v. Ladson</italic>,<cross_reference>138 Wn.2d 343</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>349</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>979 P.2d 833</cross_reference> (1999). There is a narrow exception, however, where an officer briefly detains a suspect for questioning based on a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed a crime. <italic>Terry</italic><italic>v. Ohio, 392 U.S</italic>. 1, 21-22, 30, <cross_reference>88 S.Ct. 1868</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>20 L.Ed.2d 889</cross_reference> (1968);<italic>Ladson</italic>, <cross_reference>138 Wn.2d at 350-51</cross_reference>. During an investigatory stop, an officer may also frisk the suspect for weapons upon a reasonable suspicion that the defendant is armed and dangerous. <italic>Terry</italic>, <cross_reference>392 U.S. at 29</cross_reference>; <italic>Sibron v. New</italic><italic>York</italic>, <cross_reference>392 U.S. 40</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>64</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>88 S.Ct. 1889</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>20 L.Ed.2d 917</cross_reference> (1968).

1. The Stop An officer making an investigatory stop must have reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal conduct. <italic>Terry</italic>, <cross_reference>392 U.S. at 21-22</cross_reference>, 30; <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Thompson</italic>, <cross_reference>93 Wn.2d 838</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>840-41</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>613 P.2d 525</cross_reference> (1980). We take into account the totality of the circumstances presented, including the officer's training and experience and the location and time of the stop. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Glover</italic>, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d 509</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>514</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>806 P.2d 760</cross_reference> (1991). Although the basis for the officer's suspicion need not rise to the level of probable cause to arrest or search a defendant, mere close proximity to others suspected of criminal activities or presence in a high crime area, without more, will not justify a seizure. <italic>State v. Crane</italic>, <cross_reference>105 Wn. App. 301</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>312</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>19 P.3d 1100</cross_reference> (2001). The officer's suspicion must be particular to the defendant, rather than a generalized suspicion that would justify stopping a large number of innocent citizens. <italic>State v. Ellwood</italic>,<cross_reference>52 Wn. App. 70</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>73</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>757 P.2d 547</cross_reference> (1988). A Terry stop must be reasonable both in its inception and in its scope. <italic>See State v. Williams</italic>,<cross_reference>102 Wn.2d 733</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>739-40</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>689 P.2d 1065</cross_reference> (1984).

In <italic>Ellwood</italic>, this court held that an officer's detention of a suspect and his companion based merely on the late hour and presence in a high crime area did not give officers specific and articulable facts that justified an investigatory stop. <italic>Ellwood</italic>, <cross_reference>52 Wn. App. at 73</cross_reference>. In <italic>Crane</italic>, the court held that an officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify detaining a suspect who arrived at a house at 4:30 a.m. and began to enter the house at a time when police were in the process of getting a warrant to search the house. <italic>Crane</italic>, <cross_reference>105 Wn. App. at 312-313</cross_reference>. The court noted that "Crane complied with all of [the officer's] requests" and "offered what appeared to be a legitimate reason for approaching the house." <italic>Crane</italic>, <cross_reference>105 Wn. App. at 312</cross_reference>.

Zuehlke argues that Ellwood and Crane control in this case because the trial court focused on the late hour and the high crime area rather than any particularized suspicion the officer had regarding Zuehlke or his friend. We disagree. It is true that in this case, as in Crane, the two men were cooperative and did not do anything during the encounter that would give rise to further suspicion. But Officer James, who initially stopped Zuehlke and his friend, had several particularized reasons for being suspicious of the men before he approached them. Officer James was not merely driving around looking for suspicious characters, but was responding to a complaint about two white men looking in car windows. Zuehlke and his friend, two white men, were the only people in the area when the officer arrived to investigate. Further, Zuehlke was carrying a portable C.D. player and CDs, items that the officer testified were commonly stolen in car prowls. Zuehlke argues that because looking in windows is not a crime, a complaint of people looking into car windows does not justify an investigatory stop. But a suspect's observed activity need not be criminal to justify an investigatory stop; it need only be suspicious. <italic>See, e.g., Glover</italic>, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d at 514</cross_reference>. Looking into car windows in an area frequently subject to car prowling and theft would cause a reasonable police officer to suspect that the person observed had committed or was about to commit a crime. Officer James, therefore, had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that was sufficient to justify a brief investigatory stop of Zuehlke and his friend.

<center>                                2. The Frisk</center>
In addition to questioning a subject, an officer who is performing an investigatory stop may perform a frisk for weapons if the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe the person may be armed and dangerous.<italic>State v. Hudson</italic>, <cross_reference>124 Wn.2d 107</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>112</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>874 P.2d 160</cross_reference> (1994). Such a search is permissible if (1) the initial stop is legitimate, (2) a reasonable safety concern exists to justify the frisk, and (3) the scope of the frisk is limited to the protective purpose. <italic>State v. Collins</italic>,<cross_reference>121 Wn.2d 168</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>173</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>847 P.2d 919</cross_reference> (1993). A reasonable safety concern exists when an officer can point to articulable facts which create an objectively reasonable belief that the suspect is "armed and dangerous."<italic>State v. Laskowski</italic>, <cross_reference>88 Wn. App. 858</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>860</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>950 P.2d 950</cross_reference> (1997). Because this exception to the warrant requirement is founded on legitimate and compelling concerns for officer safety, courts reviewing protective frisks are particularly reluctant to substitute their judgment for that of officers in the field. <italic>Collins</italic>, <cross_reference>121 Wn.2d at 173</cross_reference>. Nevertheless, a frisk is a particularly intrusive invasion of privacy, and thus, a "founded suspicion" must exist to ensure that such procedures are not used in an arbitrary or harassing manner. <italic>Collins</italic>,<cross_reference>121 Wn.2d at 173-74</cross_reference>.

In this case, Officer English was justified in frisking Zuehlke for weapons. Although Zuehlke was cooperative and stated that he did not have a weapon, Officer English testified that suspects in vehicle prowl investigations were frequently armed with weapons ranging from large flashlights to firearms. The contact occurred at approximately 3 a.m., the area was poorly lit, and Zuehlke was wearing a bulky jacket that could conceal a weapon. Viewing the situation through the eyes of the officers at the scene, we cannot say it was unreasonable for them to be concerned for their safety.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Zuehlke argues that the frisk in this case was improper under <italic>State v. Terrazas</italic>, <cross_reference>71 Wn. App. 873</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>879</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>863 P.2d 75</cross_reference> (1993), which held that a police officer did not have a reasonable basis to conduct a protective sweep of a car after citing a person for driving without a license. The officer in that case approached the car and noticed that a person seated in the back seat had his hands under a blanket. The court held that a protective sweep of the car was not justified because the officer "was aware of only a potential hazard; he did not have any articulable suspicions that [the passenger] personally was dangerous or may have had access to a weapon." <italic>Terrazas</italic>,<cross_reference>71 Wn. App. at 879</cross_reference>. If the only basis for Officer English's frisk of Zuehlke was the fact that he was wearing a large jacket, Terrazas would be a closely analogous case. But in this case the crime being investigated, car prowling, was one in which suspects were known to frequently carry weapons. That fact alone distinguishes this case from Terrazas, in which the crimes being investigated were driving under the influence and driving without a license. The facts of this case are more analogous to those presented in <italic>State v. Harvey</italic>, <cross_reference>41 Wn. App. 870</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>875</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>707 P.2d 146</cross_reference> (1985). In that case, we upheld a pat-down search of a suspect because (1) the officer had been told of a burglary in process 1 1/2 blocks away, (2) Harvey fit the description and had been pointed out as the suspect, and (3) burglars often carry weapons. <italic>Harvey</italic>,<cross_reference>41 Wn. App. at 875</cross_reference>. Under the facts of this case, Officer English was justified in performing a limited protective search in order to ascertain whether Zuehlke had any weapons.

<center>                           3. Scope of the Frisk</center>
When officers conduct protective frisks, "`[t]he purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.'" <italic>Minnesota</italic><italic>v. Dickerson</italic>, <cross_reference>508 U.S. 366</cross_reference> <cross_reference>113 S.Ct. 2130</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>124 L.Ed.2d 334</cross_reference> (1993) (quoting <italic>Adams v. Williams</italic>, <cross_reference>407 U.S. 143</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>146</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>92 S.Ct. 1921</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>32 L.Ed.2d 612</cross_reference> (1972)). The proper scope of a weapons frisk, therefore, is limited to a pat-down search of the outer clothing to discover weapons that might be used to assault the officer. <italic>Hudson</italic>, <cross_reference>124 Wn.2d at 112</cross_reference>. Such a search may be expanded if the officer feels hard objects inside the suspect's clothes and is unsure whether they are weapons. At that point, the officer is entitled to remove such objects and examine them. <italic>Hudson</italic>,<cross_reference>124 Wn.2d at 112</cross_reference>. But once the officer has determined that there is no weapon involved, "`the government's limited authority to invade the individual's right to be free of police intrusion is spent' and any continuing search without probable cause becomes an unreasonable intrusion into the individual's private affairs." Hudson, <cross_reference>124 Wn.2d at 112</cross_reference>
(quoting <italic>State v. Allen</italic>, <cross_reference>93 Wn.2d 170</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>172</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>606 P.2d 1235</cross_reference> (1980)).

In this case, Zuehlke argues that even if Officer English was entitled to frisk him, the officer exceeded the scope of a permissible protective frisk when he removed the small, hard containers from Zuehlke's pockets and opened them to find drugs. We agree. The record reflects that the first container Officer English found was a prescription pill bottle in Zuehlke's back pocket. On cross-examination, Officer English admitted that he could not see through the container and had to open it in order to examine its contents. Officer English did not testify he believed, based on his experience, the bottle may have contained a weapon. Once Officer English determined that the hard object he felt in Zuehlke's back pocket was not a weapon, his "limited authority" to invade Zuehlke's right to be free of police intrusion was spent. <italic>Hudson</italic>, <cross_reference>124 Wn.2d at 112</cross_reference>. Absent any evidence that he reasonably believed there could be a weapon inside, English had no right to open the pill container. Likewise, the State has failed to carry its burden of establishing that the methamphetamine was obtained by a lawful search. Officer English testified that after finding the marijuana, he continued the frisk and felt something hard in Zuehlke's front pocket, which he thought could be a weapon. Officer English asked Zuehlke what it was, and Zuehlke responded "a little crank." English removed two metal match containers from Zuehlke's pocket.

The officers looked inside the containers and found methamphetamine. Again, the officers did not testify that they believed the match containers could contain weapons, and it seems highly unlikely that they held such a belief. The State, therefore, has failed to demonstrate that the search of those containers was reasonable and within the scope of a frisk for weapons.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Accordingly, we hold that both the marijuana and the methamphetamine found on Zuehlke's person should have been suppressed. His convictions on both counts are reversed.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> The record is somewhat unclear as to whether Officer English could see the plastic pill bottle protruding from Zuehlke's back pocket or whether he felt the bottle and then saw what it was when he pulled it out. This ambiguity, however, is not material to our analysis of this case.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Zuehlke asserts that the officers had already determined that the CDs belonged to him before he was frisked. The record, however, does not support that claim. On cross-examination, Officer James stated that "at some point" Zuehlke was able to identify the CDs in the carrying case, satisfying James and English that the CDs belonged to Zuehlke. But the attorneys did not develop the testimony to pinpoint when that conversation took place, and it seems more likely from the entire record that the frisk occurred first. Further, Zuehlke has not argued that the officers should have terminated the encounter before frisking him, but rather uses the fact that the CDs were not stolen to support his argument that the initial stop was invalid. At any rate, this factual question is not ultimately material to our resolution of this case, which hinges on the scope of the frisk rather than the officer's authority to conduct it.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> Although Zuehlke admitted to having "crank" in his pocket, the State does not argue that Officer English then had probable cause to arrest Zuehlke for drug possession or that the methamphetamine inevitably would have been discovered in a more thorough search incident to arrest. Absent any argument from the State or Zuehlke on that alternative theory, we confine our analysis to the issues raised and briefed.</footnote_body>
