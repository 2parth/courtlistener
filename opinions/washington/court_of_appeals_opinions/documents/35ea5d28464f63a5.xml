<opinion_text><unpublished>  Orlando Wright appeals his conviction for first degree robbery. He contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for substitute counsel and by forcing him to go to trial represented by an attorney with whom he had a breakdown in communication. He further argues that the police violated his right to due process under the Washington constitution by failing to record his interrogation. Because Wright fails to establish that a breakdown in communication with his attorney deprived him of adequate representation and our courts have consistently held that electronic recording of interrogations is not constitutionally required, we affirm.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>
On November 4, 2005, around 6:30 a.m., two men robbed Lane Wilkinson at an ATM (automated teller machine). One of the men pointed a long-barreled assault rifle at him, and another man prevented him from leaving. The men withdrew $300 from Wilkinson's account, walked away, and drove off in a car from the bank parking lot. Wilkinson then called 911 and provided a description of the car.

Seattle police arrived almost immediately and spoke with Wilkinson. The responding officer broadcast the description of the suspects' car and direction of travel. He also investigated the scene and found a cigarette lighter, fresh cigarette butts, and saliva on the ground. Police also obtained bank surveillance video of the robbery.

A few hours later, another officer noticed a car matching the description of the suspects' car driving at high speed. When the car slowed down, the officer saw a white male driver, a female passenger, and the outline of a male lying down in the backseat. The officer told the driver to pull over, but the car sped off. The officer wrote down the license plate number and identified the car's owner as Shane Oliver.

Police arrested Oliver and his two passengers that evening. Detectives interviewed Oliver at the police station after advising him of his Miranda<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> rights. The detectives showed him the bank surveillance video, and he admitted that he was one of the men in the robbery. He was also wearing the same baseball cap at the time of his arrest that the surveillance video showed him wearing during the robbery. Police searched the trunk of Oliver's car and found a jacket with a distinctive stripe on the back that resembled a jacket one of the men wore in the bank surveillance video.

Detectives also interviewed one of the passengers, Jarette Williams, and, after that interview, began looking for another suspect named Orlando Wright.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Police found Wright at about 2:00 a.m. the day after the robbery, arrested him, and brought him to the police station for questioning. Wright spoke to detectives after being read his Miranda rights. The interview was not tape-recorded. According to the detectives, Wright admitted knowing Oliver, after they showed him photographs of Oliver, and told the detectives that he was just with him in his car yesterday when he was with his "`lady friend.'" After he saw the bank surveillance video, Wright admitted to his role in the robbery. He then offered to retrieve the rifle used in the robbery but only if the police released him and gave him money. He also told the detectives that the rifle was fully loaded and "`ready to go.'" Wright ultimately changed his mind about his offer to find the rifle, telling the detective that he needed some rest "`before I go out and do your dirty work.'"

After arresting both Oliver and Wright, police took mouth swabs from them for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing as directed by court order. DNA samples from the saliva and some of the cigarette butts found on the ground of the bank parking lot matched Oliver's DNA profile, and samples from one of the cigarette butts matched Wright's.

The State charged Wright and Oliver with one count of first degree robbery, and also alleged that Wright was armed with a firearm. Trial was initially set for January 3, 2006, and Wright was represented by appointed counsel, Ramona Brandes, at the time. On December 21, 2005, Brandes withdrew as counsel based on a conflict of interest and new counsel, Julie Gaisford, was appointed. The trial was continued to February 6, 2006. A few weeks later, Wright hired private counsel, Eugene Piculell, and trial was continued to March 8, 2006. The trial was continued again to May 16, 2006, because of scheduling and discovery issues.

On May 16, 2006, the case was sent out as a bench trial before Judge Joan DuBuque. Piculell informed the court that he anticipated that Wright would follow his recommendation to try the case before the bench but that Wright now wanted a jury trial, "which, of course, is his right." The parties then agreed to continue the trial to June 12, 2006.

On May 23, 2006, at a continuance hearing before Judge Ronald Kessler, Wright told the court that he had a conflict of interest with counsel because Piculell requested a bench trial without his consent. The court told Wright that this was incorrect and that the case was set for a jury trial. Wright then told the court that he was in the process of hiring another attorney. The court said that it would be fine if the attorney came in and was prepared for trial on June 27. But the court stressed that the "new lawyer is going to have to be ready to go on June 27. Or argue to me why they shouldn't be ready."

On June 27, 2006, the case was sent out for trial before Judge Theresa Doyle, and Piculell appeared with Wright. The prosecutor told the court that "since that time that we appeared before Judge DuBuque, there has been absolutely no communication with any other attorney on behalf of Mr. Wright, no notice of appearance, and for the record[,] there is no other attorney present." Piculell explained that a week after the hearing before Judge Kessler, an attorney named Alfoster Garrett contacted him, told him that Wright's family had retained him to represent Wright, and faxed him a notice of substitution of counsel. According to Piculell, Garret also asked about his thoughts on the evidentiary issues in the case, and Piculell wrote a summary of the issues which he faxed to Garrett along with his substitution of counsel and notice of withdrawal. Garrett also asked for the discovery, and Piculell had it sent by messenger to his office.

Sometime later, Piculell learned that Garrett had not yet contacted the prosecutor. Piculell then became concerned and emailed Garrett and Wright's mother about his concerns. He told Garrett that if he was representing Wright, he needed to take legal steps to effectuate his representation. He told Garrett that he needed to file the substitution of counsel or "some other arrangements need to be made concerning counsel" and explained the procedure for noting the motion. When he received no response, he sent another email to Garrett that essentially stated: "`[F]ile the substitution or return the discovery.'" Garrett eventually returned the discovery to Piculell and told him that he was never retained by Wright.

Piculell then told the court that although he had no desire to represent anyone who did not want him to represent him, he understood his professional obligations. He told the court that Wright wished to have another attorney and asked Wright to address the court. Wright then told the court that his involvement with Piculell had "changed drastically" and that he was suing Piculell to recover money paid to him. When the court questioned him further about this lawsuit, Wright admitted that he was not exactly sure of the particular action his mother was taking against Piculell and thought she might be filing something with the bar association. Piculell told the court he had not been served with a lawsuit or contacted by the bar association.

The court then asked why Garrett was not at the hearing and Wright responded: "Well, as of last week, I wasn't able to, but he instructed me to come and do this. And after this, he was going to set the motion to be my current counsel. There was a financial situation that occurred." When the court asked if he had paid Garrett, Wright claimed that he had only recently obtained money to pay Garrett and would transfer that money after the hearing. He then told the court that Garrett would be ready to substitute in if the court allowed it and he would be able to pay him.

The State argued that Wright's request for a continuance and motion to substitute counsel were "incredibly late," noting that this was the second time the case was called for trial and Wright had had almost a month and a half to retain new counsel. The court denied Wright's motion as untimely. The court also noted that Garrett was not physically present in the courtroom and had made no representation that he would be able to proceed to trial, either that day or sometime soon.

The parties then addressed pretrial matters. Piculell indicated that he would not be calling any defense witnesses and spoke with the prosecutor about exhibits. Wright interrupted and complained that he had not discussed "any of this" with Piculell. The court then offered him time to discuss the evidence with counsel, but Wright responded: "I'm not discussing nothing with him. This is just not my counsel. I have Mr. Garrett, he has been my counsel. And you will be giving away my jury trial rights without even asking me. And this is not my counsel, period."

The court then held a CrR 3.5 hearing, and Wright denied making any of the incriminating statements, including admitting to the robbery. He also testified that he did not recall if his Miranda rights were read and that police ignored his request for a lawyer. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the police had advised Wright of his Miranda rights, the officers were credible, and it was unlikely that Wright made none of the statements attributed to him.

After the CrR 3.5 hearing, the court noted that Wright had his back turned to Piculell during examination of the witnesses and asked him some questions about his earlier motion about substitution of counsel. Wright explained that he did so because Piculell was inadequate in defending him. When the court asked him to elaborate, Wright again accused Piculell of giving away his jury rights without his consent. Wright also complained that Piculell had not discussed the case enough with him, met with him only three times, and had not done "the homework" necessary to properly defend him. Wright told the court he was "overwhelmed" and would not communicate with Piculell. He also said that he needed counsel who thought he was innocent and complained that Piculell encouraged him to take a deal.

When the court told him that he was not helping his situation by remaining mute, Wright replied: "I want it to be on record to the fact that I am not in agreement with my counsel during the whole entire trial." The court then asked him why he thought he had a conflict and he responded:

<block_quote>  Because if a person — I'm human, and I'm not going to be trying to help that person, for certain reasons. Aside from professional, there is a job he has to do. Of course, dealing with the judicial system, this is a job he has to do, but he doesn't have to do that to the fullness of his capability at all. This is not his life on the line; this is my life.</block_quote>

The court then asked him about the dispute over the retainer and whether it had something to do with Garrett's willingness to substitute in, and he responded that "[a]t first, there was a discrepancy," but now he had the money to pay Garrett. The court also asked again about the bar complaint. Wright said that Picullel called his mother a liar and that his mother was in Chicago, but he was not exactly sure whether she was suing Piculell. He also stated that his family did not feel that Picullel deserved the payments he received from the family.

The court then asked Piculell to address the court and he stated: "It is very difficult to represent an individual under these circumstances." But he also recognized that "from a professional standpoint" he was an officer of the court with certain obligations that he was willing to fulfill. When the court asked Piculell if he felt there had been a total breakdown of communication between him and his client, he responded that there had been, as evidenced by Wright's behavior toward him in court and his refusal to speak to him during recess. But he also told the court:

<block_quote>  [W]hile I'm not discouraging the court in any way from finding that I'm relieved from my obligation to represent Mr. Wright, please don't misconstrue me. I'm indicating I believe I have a certain obligation, and I'm here to meet that unless directed by an order of the court.</block_quote>

The court then noted that it had fulfilled its duty under the case law to inquire, and again denied the motion to continue and substitute counsel. The court stated that its ruling was based on three reasons: (1) the motion was untimely because it was made the day of trial; (2) there was no actual conflict of interest; and (3) any breakdown in communication was entirely of Wright's making because he chose not to participate in the trial or communicate with counsel and could change that anytime if he chose to do so.

The parties then proceeded with voir dire, during which Wright yelled out that Piculell was not his attorney and that he was being tried by ambush. After voir dire, Piculell asked the court if it would consider a motion to substitute counsel if Garrett appeared the next day. The court stated that while it had grave concerns about whether a new attorney could really "step right in" and provide "excellent representation," it would certainly consider the motion if Garrett appeared. Garrett did not appear the next day. Wright claimed that his grandfather tried to contact Garrett but was unsuccessful. The judge told Wright that if Garrett had appeared, she would have seriously considered allowing him to substitute in as counsel. Piculell then continued to represent Wright at trial.

The next day, Wright insisted on wearing his jail clothes as a protest of the proceedings. Despite being warned by the court that he would be found in contempt if he communicated with the jury, he twice propped up notes from his table stating: "`I am being tried via ambush.'" The State presented testimony from Wilkinson and the investigating officer, and expert testimony about the DNA analysis of the cigarette butts and saliva. Wright did not testify or present evidence. Piculell waived opening statement and closing argument, stating on the record that he was doing so for "strategic" purposes.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>

The jury found Wright guilty and that he was armed with a firearm.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> The court sentenced him to 96 months in prison, consecutive to 60 days imposed for contempt findings.

<center>                               DISCUSSION</center>
I. Continuance To Obtain Counsel of Choice

Wright contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice by denying his motion for a continuance and substitution of counsel. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes a limited right to counsel of choice.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> But "a defendant may not insist on representation by an attorney he cannot afford or who for other reasons declines to represent the defendant."<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> An erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel of choice is a structural error requiring reversal without a harmless error analysis.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

A trial court has great latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness and the demands of its calendar.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> A trial court does not violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right by denying his untimely request to retain counsel of his or her choice.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> The trial court violates this right only by "`an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.'"<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> Thus, the trial court must balance the defendant's right to counsel of his or her choice against the public's interest in prompt and efficient administration of justice.<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference>

To determine whether the trial court abused its discretion, we consider the following factors: (1) whether the court granted previous defense requested continuances, (2) whether the defendant had some legitimate cause for dissatisfaction with counsel, even though it fell short of arguably incompetent representation, and (3) whether available counsel is prepared to go to trial.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> The request for counsel of choice must also be timely asserted.<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> Continuances requested on the day of trial are not favored, and the trial court may properly deny a continuance if the defendant was not diligent in procuring replacement counsel.<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference>

In State v. Price, the trial court properly denied the defendant's request for new counsel when he failed to demonstrate that he could actually retain a new attorney.<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference>
He offered no evidence to support his claim that he could afford to hire a new attorney and no other competent counsel appeared who was prepared to go to trial.<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference> The court also found that his request — made on the second day of trial — was untimely and to grant it would entail substantial delay and prejudice to the other parties involved.<footnote_reference>[fn17]</footnote_reference> Similarly, in Chase, the court properly denied the defendant's request for new counsel on the day of trial when he claimed that he had retained another attorney, but that attorney had not appeared in the case, which had been pending for seven weeks.<footnote_reference>[fn18]</footnote_reference>

Likewise here, the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it denied Wright's request for a continuance to substitute counsel. He was advised over a month before trial that his new attorney must be ready for trial on June 27 or be prepared to argue why he needed more time. But this attorney, Mr. Garrett, did not appear on June 27, nor did he ever appear in the case or file a notice of appearance. And according to Piculell, his last contact with Garrett was when he returned the discovery and stated that he was not retained to represent Wright. In any event, the trial court ultimately decided to give Wright an additional day to produce Garrett, but he failed to do so. The trial court gave Wright every opportunity to obtain counsel of his choice. It did not abuse its discretion by denying a further continuance to secure his presence.

II. Irreconcilable Conflict With Counsel

Wright also argues that there was an irreconcilable conflict in the attorney-client relationship that deprived him of his right to representation. The State does not address this as an additional ground for relief nor does the State discuss the case law cited by Wright in support of this claim, but simply characterizes this argument as a claim of ineffective assistance. The State asserts that Wright waived this claim by failing to assign it as error and that even if properly raised, he fails to show that counsel's performance was inadequate.

The Sixth Amendment does not guarantee a meaningful relationship between an accused and counsel.<footnote_reference>[fn19]</footnote_reference> The right to counsel focuses on "the adversarial process, not on the accused's relationship with his lawyer as such."<footnote_reference>[fn20]</footnote_reference> But "if the relationship between lawyer and client completely collapses, the refusal to substitute new counsel violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel."<footnote_reference>[fn21]</footnote_reference>
When the breakdown of a relationship between attorney and defendant from irreconcilable differences results in the complete denial of counsel, a defendant is not required to show prejudice.<footnote_reference>[fn22]</footnote_reference> "An irreconcilable conflict undermines confidence in trial proceedings and is reversible error."<footnote_reference>[fn23]</footnote_reference>

Our courts have adopted the Ninth Circuit's test to determine whether an irreconcilable conflict exists.<footnote_reference>[fn24]</footnote_reference> Under this test, courts consider the following factors: (1) the extent of the conflict, (2) the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the conflict, and (3) the timeliness of the motion.<footnote_reference>[fn25]</footnote_reference> While this test covers some of the same ground as the test for substitution of counsel, the courts have recognized that "the differences are substantial enough to constitute a new ground for relief."<footnote_reference>[fn26]</footnote_reference>
The inquiry is focused on the breakdown's effect on the representation the client actually receives.<footnote_reference>[fn27]</footnote_reference> If the representation is inadequate, prejudice is presumed.<footnote_reference>[fn28]</footnote_reference>

Wright contends that, as in Brown v. Craven, his irreconcilable conflict with Picullel deprived him of assistance of counsel because he "was forced into a trial with the assistance of a particular lawyer with whom he was dissatisfied, with whom he would not cooperate, and with whom he would not, in any manner whatsoever, communicate," and his attorney was unable to present an adequate defense on his behalf.<footnote_reference>[fn29]</footnote_reference> Like Wright, the defendant in Brown refused to speak with counsel and complained in open court about counsel, stating: "`I have no Lawyer here.'"<footnote_reference>[fn30]</footnote_reference> There, the trial court had summarily denied four motions to appoint another attorney without adequately inquiring into the source of Brown's dissatisfaction with counsel. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding particularly problematic that the trial court did not take "the necessary time and conduct such necessary inquiry as might have eased Brown's dissatisfaction, distrust, and concern."<footnote_reference>[fn31]</footnote_reference> The court further concluded that it was "not unreasonable to believe that had Brown been represented by counsel in whom he had confidence[,] he would have been convicted, if at all, of no more than [a much lesser offense.]"<footnote_reference>[fn32]</footnote_reference>

But unlike in Brown, the trial court here did conduct an adequate inquiry into the source of Wright's dissatisfaction with counsel and gave him an opportunity to secure substitute counsel. The court inquired before trial began and again after the CrR 3.5 hearing when the breakdown in communication became more apparent. Additionally, unlike in Brown where the defendant alleged that his attorney failed to interview available witnesses that were relevant to proof of his intent, Wright did not make any specific allegations that Picullel was unprepared to adequately represent him.<footnote_reference>[fn33]</footnote_reference> Rather, he complained generally that Picullel did not meet with him enough or believe in his innocence.

Finally, unlike in Brown where the court concluded that the defendant might have been convicted of a lesser offense or not convicted at all, the same cannot be said of the case against Wright. He was caught on surveillance video, his DNA was found at the scene, and he confessed to the crime. Defense counsel mounted a reasonable defense against such facts, challenging the admission of the confession and adequately cross-examining the State's witnesses. The claimed deficiencies in Picullel's performance — failure to call witnesses and give closing argument — fall within the realm of acceptable trial strategy and do not establish inadequate representation.<footnote_reference>[fn34]</footnote_reference>

The other cases upon which Wright relies are likewise distinguishable. In Moore, the attorney failed to inform the defendant of important developments about plea negotiations and admitted to have done nothing in 68 days but interview the defendant's son.<footnote_reference>[fn35]</footnote_reference> The defendant threatened to sue the attorney, and the attorney claimed he felt physically threatened by the defendant.<footnote_reference>[fn36]</footnote_reference> Counsel also warned the court on the record that if the defendant was forced to go to trial with him as his attorney, he would be denied his fundamental right to have zealous counsel.<footnote_reference>[fn37]</footnote_reference> The court concluded that the defendant presented "strong evidence of an irreconcilable conflict" that undermined confidence in the trial proceedings and reversed and remanded for a new trial.<footnote_reference>[fn38]</footnote_reference> The court also concluded that the trial court's inquiry into the conflict was minimal and did not adequately address the concerns the conflict raised.<footnote_reference>[fn39]</footnote_reference>

In United States v. Walker, the court held that a breakdown in communication warranted a new trial when the defendant had refused to speak to his attorney about the case because he decided he wanted a new attorney.<footnote_reference>[fn40]</footnote_reference> There, the defendant refused to answer specific questions his attorney asked that were necessary to prepare the case, and the trial court denied the attorney's request to withdraw, despite the attorney's acknowledgement on the record that they had irreconcilable differences that prevented him from representing the defendant.<footnote_reference>[fn41]</footnote_reference> The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the defendant's dispute with counsel was based on trial preparation and counsel's failure to contact important witnesses, rather than "any general unreasonableness or manufactured discontent," and that as a result of the conflict, the defendant did not testify, and counsel mounted a "limited, if not perfunctory, defense."<footnote_reference>[fn42]</footnote_reference>

But here, unlike the lawyers in Moore and Walker, Picullel did not move for withdrawal or warn the court that Wright's refusal to cooperate would result in a denial of adequate representation.<footnote_reference>[fn43]</footnote_reference> While he admitted that it was "very difficult to represent an individual under these circumstances," he also told the court that he believed he had certain professional obligations that he was willing to meet. Nor were there any allegations of physical threats here as in Moore, or specific allegations that the dispute related to trial preparation and failure to contact particular witnesses as in Walker. Additionally, Wright's claim that he was taking legal action against Picullel was unsupported; at most it consisted of an equivocal allegation that Wright's mother might have filed a bar complaint, which alone is insufficient to disqualify counsel.<footnote_reference>[fn44]</footnote_reference>

Thus, the facts here do not rise to the level of an irreconcilable conflict warranting reversal. As in Morris v. Slappy, Wright's adamant refusal to cooperate with counsel did not violate the right to assistance of counsel.<footnote_reference>[fn45]</footnote_reference> In Morris, like here, despite the defendant's numerous outbursts and disruptions during trial, counsel assured the court that he was ready for trial and presented an adequate defense.<footnote_reference>[fn46]</footnote_reference>

III. Recorded Interrogation

Wright also contends that the detectives' failure to electronically record his interrogation violated his right to due process under the Washington Constitution. We have already considered and rejected this argument in State v. Spurgeon.<footnote_reference>[fn47]</footnote_reference> Wright offers no compelling reasons to depart from the reasoning in Spurgeon, but simply urges us to follow a contrary view from the Alaska court in Stephan v. State.<footnote_reference>[fn48]</footnote_reference>
We declined to follow that case in Spurgeon and do not find it any more persuasive now.<footnote_reference>[fn49]</footnote_reference>

If not constitutionally required, Wright argues in the alternative that we impose such a requirement as part of the court's "supervisory powers." But because Wright did not make this claim below and fails to establish that it is an issue of constitutional magnitude, we do not consider it for the first time on appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn50]</footnote_reference> For the Court:

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> The record does not indicate what information Williams gave police during the interview, but presumably it was information linking Wright to the robbery.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> Wright's and Oliver's cases were joined for trial, and Oliver's attorney also waived opening statement but gave a closing argument. The State asserts that Piculell ultimately gave a closing argument after the parties identified an error in the instructions. But the State cites only to the trial court minutes that note "[a]dditional final arguments by defendant Wright," speculating that there was a "gap" in the transcript that somehow omitted these additional arguments. No transcript of any additional closing argument was designated for appeal; the verbatim report of proceedings indicates only that an instructional error was identified and the jury was instructed to stop deliberating.</footnote_body>
