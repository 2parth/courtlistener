<opinion_text><unpublished>  Sean Michael Moinette appeals his second degree assault conviction for beating a fellow inmate. He argues that the trial court erred in denying his CrR 3.5 pretrial motion to suppress his confession, which he contends the investigating officers coerced. Holding that the trial court did not err in ruling Moinette's confession was voluntary, we affirm.

<center>                                   FACTS</center><center>                                 I. Assault</center>
As Michael Rogers was watching television one evening in one of the Pierce County Jail common areas, Sean Moinette came up behind him, put a pink towel or tee-shirt over his head, and yanked it backwards. Moinette and another inmate beat Rogers more than ten times before Rogers lost consciousness. Rogers did not see who assaulted him. Nor did any corrections officer witness the beating.

When Rogers regained consciousness, he notified a corrections officer. Rogers had suffered a fractured skull, a broken occipital eye socket, a fractured cheekbone, a broken nose, two jawbone fractures, and neck injuries. The jail unit was immediately "locked down" while officers searched the other inmates for cuts and blood-spattered clothes. The officers found nothing.

<center>                       II. Investigation; Confession</center>
Supervising correctional officer Lieutenant Louis Genga oversaw the assault investigation. Pierce County Sheriff Detective John Jimenez assisted.

Later the same evening as the assault, Genga and Jimenez interviewed Rogers, who said he had not seen his assailant(s). During this interview, another corrections officer approached Genga with a "kite," an anonymous note that had been slipped out from under one of the cell doors into the middle of the jail's dayroom. This note named two inmates as the assailants, one of whom was Sean Moinette. Genga and Jimenez decided to interview Moinette.

At 12:40 a.m. early the next morning, officers woke Moinette and brought him to an office for interview. Jimenez introduced himself to Moinette and explained that he was investigating an assault that had occurred earlier in the afternoon. Jimenez asked which cell was his, if he knew anything about the assault, and why he had attacked Rogers. Moinette responded, "I did not hit that dude, man." Jimenez then read Moinette his <italic>Miranda</italic><footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> warnings, and asked Moinette if he understood them. When Moinette responded, "Yes, I do," Jimenez asked Moinette if he wished to waive those rights. Moinette replied, "[Y]es."

Jimenez continued the interview for approximately 20 minutes, asking Moinette various questions about the assault. Eventually Moinette provided information about the assault and said that another inmate, David Allen Wright, had committed the assault on Rogers. When Moinette would not agree to tape-record these statements, Detective Jimenez ended the interview. Genga directed Moinette to stand up and directed another correctional officer to place Moinette in segregation.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Officers then handcuffed and escorted Moinette out of the office.

Several minutes later they returned because Moinette said he wanted to talk further. Jimenez reminded Moinette that his <italic>Miranda</italic> rights still applied, and that Moinette did not have to talk to Detective Jimenez if he (Moinette) did not want to. Moinette then implicated himself in the assault: He admitted that he put a shirt over Rogers' head from behind, pulled it down over Rogers' face, and pulled backwards. Moinette said that Wright "did the rest."

<center>                               III. Procedure</center>
The State charged Moinette with second degree assault. Moinette moved to suppress his confession. Detective Jimenez or Lieutenant Genga testified to the facts as set forth earlier in this opinion.

Moinette's testimony at the CrR 3.5 hearing differed from his statements to Jimenez and Genga. At the hearing, Moinette testified as follows: An officer woke him in the middle of the night and brought him to a room where Jimenez and Genga waited. Genga told him that there had been an assault earlier in the afternoon, in which a note had implicated him and another inmate, Wright.

Moinette claimed that Genga never read him his <italic>Miranda</italic> rights, that he never waived his rights, and that he never admitted assaulting Rogers. Moinette testified that when he failed to admit to the assault, Genga mentioned Moinette's son and said that, although Moinette was "looking at a lot of time" for the assault, if he told Genga what had happened, "everything would be fine, everything would go away." Report of Proceeding (RP) (March 6, 2006) at 37. Moinette asserted that even at that point, he did not admit to the assault; he was then handcuffed and told he was going to "the hole."

Moinette further testified that (1) a corrections officer leading him to segregation told him that if he (Moinette) told Genga what had happened, he (Moinette) would not get in trouble; (2) he (Moinette) never asked to return to Genga, but the escorting officer took him back to the office anyway; (3) when they returned to the office, the officer went inside for a moment, leaving Moinette in the hallway alone, and then ushered Moinette back into the office; (4) Genga asked him (Moinette) what he had to say, to which he (Moinette) replied that he did not want to go into "the hole" and that if "he want[ed] anybody to blame . . . you can blame me"; and (5) he (Moinette) then admitted to the assault because the anonymous note had already accused him, and Genga believed the note. RP (March 6, 2006) at 40.

The trial court issued an oral ruling that included findings of fact on the witnesses' respective credibilities. The trial court stated (1) it did not believe Moinette's testimony that Jimenez or Genga told him that if he confessed to the assault, everything would "be just fine"; (2) even if Jimenez or Genga had said something along those lines, Moinette, a man with an extensive criminal history, would not have reasonably believed it; (3) Moinette's testimony — that the escorting correctional officer indicated that he (Moinette) would not be placed in segregation if he told what happened — was not credible. The trial court did find credible Moinette's disappointment in himself for implicating fellow inmate Wright in a crime and Moinette's belief that he (Moinette) would gain some credibility among his fellow inmates if they believed he was part of the assault.

The trial court also found that Jimenez did not re-read Moinette his<italic>Miranda</italic> rights when Moinette returned to the interview office. The trial court reasoned that Jimenez did not need to read Moinette his <italic>Miranda</italic>
warnings again because Moinette had initiated the second half of the interview, which was close in time to the initial <italic>Miranda</italic> warnings. The trial court ruled that, therefore, Moinette's subsequent inculpatory statements were admissible. Based on this oral ruling, the State prepared and the trial court signed written findings of fact and conclusions of law.

At trial, the State introduced Moinette's inculpatory statements, together with physical evidence of the severe beating that Rogers had suffered. A jury convicted Moinette of second degree assault. Moinette appeals.

<center>                                  ANALYSIS</center>
Moinette argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession. We disagree.

<center>                            II. Findings of Fact</center>
Moinette challenges the trial court's finding of fact that when Moinette returned to the interview office "Detective Jimenez `reminded [him] that his <italic>Miranda</italic> rights still applied and that he didn't have to talk with the detective,' and that the detective `again . . . reminded the defendant that his Miranda rights still applied.'" Br. of Appellant at 1.

<center>                           A. Standard of Review</center>
We review the trial court's findings of fact for substantial evidence.<italic>State v. Broadaway</italic>, <cross_reference>133 Wn.2d 118</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>130</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>942 P.2d 363</cross_reference> (1997). Substantial evidence supports a finding where there is a sufficient quantity of evidence to persuade a rational person of the truth of the finding. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Hill</italic>, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d 641</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>644</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>870 P.2d 313</cross_reference> (1994). The test for determining sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <italic>State v. Salinas</italic>,<cross_reference>119 Wn.2d 192</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>201</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>829 P.2d 1068</cross_reference> (1992). When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case, we must draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the State and interpret them most strongly against the defendant. <italic>Id.</italic>

Credibility determinations are for the trier of fact and are not subject to appellate court review. <italic>State v. Camarillo</italic>, <cross_reference>115 Wn.2d 60</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>71</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>794 P.2d 850</cross_reference> (1990). Instead, we must defer to the trier of fact on issues of conflicting testimony, credibility of witnesses, and the persuasiveness of the evidence. <italic>See State v. Cord</italic>, <cross_reference>103 Wn.2d 361</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>367</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>693 P.2d 81</cross_reference> (1985).

<center>                           B. Witness Credibility</center>
The trial court based its findings on the conflicting testimonies of Jimenez, Genga, and Moinette. The trial court did not find Moinette credible on the issue of whether and when Jimenez advised Moinette of his<italic>Miranda</italic> rights. In contrast, the trial court believed Jimenez and Genga. Because we do not review the trial court's credibility determinations and the record supports them, we accept the trial court's finding that Jimenez reminded Moinette of his <italic>Miranda</italic> rights when Moinette returned to the interview.

Moinette challenges no other findings of fact. Therefore, we consider the trial court's remaining unchallenged findings of fact as verities upon appeal. <italic>Hill</italic>, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d at 644</cross_reference>. The unchallenged findings are:

<center>                              UNDISPUTED FACTS</center>
On October 19, 2005, at about 1735 hours, Pierce County Jail Corrections Officers became aware that an inmate identified as M. Rogers has sustained significant facial injuries as a result of an assault;

M. Rogers was in the 4 South Dayroom when the assault occurred;

M. Rogers had been watching television when someone placed something over his head from behind and someone else began beating him about the face;

The only thing M. Rogers remembers about the assault was that something was placed over his head before he began being hit in the face. M. Rogers woke up on the floor after being unconscious for a short period of time;

As a result of the assault, M. Rogers suffered an orbital blowout fracture of bones near his left eye;

M. Rogers did not see who assaulted him;

After the assault, a note written by an anonymous person was found on the jail floor indicating that the defendant and another inmate had assaulted M. Rogers; On October 20, 2005, at about 0040 hours, the defendant was brought to a jail office to be questioned regarding the assault;

Present at the interview were Off. Tony Mastandrea and Lt. Luis Genga, from the Pierce County Jail, and Det. John Jimenez from the Pierce County Sheriff's Department

Once in the office, the defendant was asked what cell he lived in and the defendant responded "4S-C-26;"

The defendant was asked if he knew about the fight in the cell area and the defendant stated that he did but he had been in his room when the fight occurred;

The defendant was then asked why he attacked the other inmate and the defendant stated "I did not hit that dude, man;"

At 0045 hours, Det. Jimenez fully advised the defendant of his <italic>Miranda</italic>
warnings from a preprinted card;

The defendant understood his rights and didn't have any questions about the rights;

The defendant was asked if he wished to waive his rights and speak with the officers about the incident and the defendant answered "yes;"

The defendant gave a statement and implicated the inmate in "27 house" as the person responsible for the assault;

The defendant continued talking about the assault until 0100 when Det. Jimenez asked him if he'd agree to make a tape-recorded statement and thedefendant declined to do so;

After the defendant declined to make a tape-recorded statement the interview was terminated and the defendant handcuffed and escorted out of the office;

Lt. Genga instructed Corrections Officer Mastandrea to take the defendant to a disciplinary unit in the jail;

The defendant and Off. Mastandrea only made it to a nearby elevator on their way to the disciplinary unit when the defendant told the officer that he wanted to speak with Det. Jimenez again;

At 0105 hours Off. Mastandrea returned to the office with the defendant;

The defendants handcuffs were removed . . .

The defendant stated that he had something else he wanted to tell the detective . . .

The defendant then made a statement admitting to putting a shirt over M. Rogers' head from behind, pulling it down over his face and pulling back on the shirt;

The defendant named the other assailant that did the actual punching of M. Rogers' face;

The interview ended at 0110 hours and the defendant was escorted out of the office and to a disciplinary cell in the jail;

<center>                           II. Conclusions of Law</center>
Moinette challenges the trial court's conclusion of law that:

Because officers were conducting an initial investigation in their attempt to determine whether the defendant was involved in an assault, the officers had no duty to advise the defendant of [his] Miranda warnings/rights upon initial contact.

Clerk's Papers at 78. Moinette also challenges the trial court's conclusion of law that Moinette made his statement "knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently." He contends that his statements were not voluntary because he believed that Genga would segregate him from the general inmate population if he did not confess to the crime. This argument fails.

<center>                           A. Standard of Review</center>
We review de novo whether the findings of fact support the trial court's conclusions of law. <italic>State v. Mendez</italic>, <cross_reference>137 Wn.2d 208</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>214</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>970 P.2d 722</cross_reference> (1999). The State has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Moinette's statement was voluntary.<italic>State v. Braun</italic>, <cross_reference>82 Wn.2d 157</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>162</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>509 P.2d 742</cross_reference> (1973). Our inquiry is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, Moinette's will was overborne such that his confession was involuntary. <italic>Broadaway</italic>,<cross_reference>133 Wn.2d at 132</cross_reference>. We consider factors such as Moinette's physical condition, age, mental abilities, experience, and police conduct. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Aten</italic>, <cross_reference>130 Wn.2d 640</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>664</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>927 P.2d 210</cross_reference> (1996). We must consider any promises or misrepresentations interrogating officers made and determine if there is a causal relationship between the promise and the confession such that Moinette's confession was not a free act. <italic>Broadaway</italic>,<cross_reference>133 Wn.2d at 132</cross_reference>.

<center>                       B. Voluntariness of Confession</center>
Moinette does not challenge the trial court's following findings of fact: (1) based on Moinette's criminal history, it is implausible that Moinette would have believed he would suffer no consequences if he confessed to this violent assault; (2) neither Jimenez nor Genga told Moinette he would face no consequences if he admitted having participated in the assault;<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> (3) Jimenez fully advised Moinette of his <italic>Miranda</italic>
rights and he waived them; and (4) Moinette's decision to return to the interview office was due to his concern for his reputation among his fellow inmates and his concern about implicating Wright.

Moreover, these unchallenged findings of fact, which we accept as verities on appeal, support the trial court's conclusion of law that Moinette's return to the interview office and his subsequent confession were voluntary and not coerced. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not err in admitting the Moinette's confession.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.
