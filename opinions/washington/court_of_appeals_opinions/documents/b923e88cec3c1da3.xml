<opinion_text><unpublished>  In these consolidated appeals, juveniles Daniel and Mark Trevino pleaded guilty to two counts of malicious mischief after breaking windows at Ephrata Middle School and two local businesses. As part of their disposition orders, the young men were required to pay restitution to the victims. The restitution order included a payment of $817.82 to the Ephrata School District to reimburse it for the wages paid to the maintenance workers who cleaned up and repaired the damage to the school. This amount was calculated by totaling the number of hours the maintenance workers devoted to the project multiplied by the hourly wages each worker earned. Claiming this was an abuse of the court's discretion, the Trevinos appeal. Finding no error, we affirm.

When employees of Ephrata Middle School arrived at work on April 20, 2001, they noticed several windows and two doors had been broken. Broken windows were also reported by two local businesses in the same area of town. After an investigation by the Ephrata Police Department, Daniel Trevino, age 16, was charged by information in the Grant County Superior Court Juvenile Department with: Count 1-malicious mischief in the second degree, and Counts 2 and 3-malicious mischief in the third degree. While represented by counsel, Daniel pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 2. Count 3 was dismissed and a restitution hearing was ordered held at a later date. Mark Trevino, age 14, was charged by amended information with: Count 1-malicious mischief in the second degree, and Count 2-complicity to malicious mischief in the third degree. He was also represented by counsel and pleaded guilty to the charges. Disposition orders within the standard range were entered but the restitution issue was reserved until after a hearing on September 18, 2001.

During the restitution hearing both the school principal and maintenance supervisor testified that maintenance workers had to take time away from their regular duties in order to clean up the mess and repair the broken windows. The maintenance supervisor testified that it took about 49 hours to clean up and repair the damage and at a wage of just over $16 per hour, the total cost to the District was $817.82. At the conclusion of the restitution hearing the court ordered the young men jointly and severally liable for the following: (1) $536.70 to the District for the cost of the windows; (2) $817.82<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> to the District for the labor associated with clean up and repair of the damage; and (3) $127.00 to Dusty's In and Out for window replacement. Arguing the District's labor cost was improperly ordered, the Trevinos filed timely notices of appeal.

<center>                                  Analysis</center>
The Trevinos contend the trial court erred when it included as part of their restitution orders the requirement that the District be reimbursed for the costs associated with the clean up and replacement of the broken windows at the school. A trial court's restitution order is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Wilson, <cross_reference>100 Wn. App. 44</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>47</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>995 P.2d 1260</cross_reference> (2000). A court will find evidence sufficient regarding injury to or loss of property as long as the evidence provides a reasonable basis for estimating the loss and does not subject the fact finder to speculation or conjecture. Id. at 52.

Under the Juvenile Justice Act of 1977, chapter <cross_reference>13</cross_reference>.40 RCW, the Legislature's intent is to `[m]ake the juvenile offender accountable for his or her criminal behavior; . . . [and to] [p]rovide for restitution to victims of crime.' RCW <cross_reference>13.40.010</cross_reference>(2)(c), (h). In other words, the goal is victim compensation as well as juvenile accountability. Restitution is defined by the statute as `financial reimbursement by the offender to the victim, and shall be limited to easily ascertainable damages for injury to or loss of property.' RCW <cross_reference>13.40.020</cross_reference>(22). The statute governing restitution in a juvenile proceeding states in part: `In its dispositional order, the court shall require the respondent to make restitution to any persons who have suffered loss or damage as a result of the offense committed by the respondent.' RCW <cross_reference>13.40.190</cross_reference>(1).

The Trevinos complain the trial court improperly awarded restitution to the District for the wages of its employees while they cleaned up and repaired the damage caused by the broken windows. The young men assert they should not have to pay the maintenance workers' wages because the maintenance workers would have been paid by the District regardless of whether they were cleaning up and replacing broken windows or doing any other maintenance job around the school. The Trevinos maintain that because there were no overtime wages paid to the maintenance workers for the clean up and repair of the broken windows, the work done on any particular day had already been planned for and approved in the District's budget. We disagree.

While the maintenance workers at Ephrata Middle School cleaned up and repaired the damage they were prevented from carrying out their regular duties. Courts in this state have allowed the victim's labor to be included in an order of restitution for damage to property. In State v. Horner, <cross_reference>53 Wn. App. 806</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>808</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>770 P.2d 1056</cross_reference> (1989), the court determined:

<block_quote>  `The nature of the damage caused by the offense remains the same regardless of who makes the repairs, and denying restitution to those victims who make their own repairs would defeat the statutory purpose of making offenders accountable for their actions.' This statement also applies to the circumstances in this case. The District's expenses for the maintenance workers' salaries are easily ascertainable and the direct result of the crime committed. The District provided sufficient evidence of the labor costs during the clean up and repair of the damage the Trevinos caused. As such, the court's restitution orders compensate the victims and hold the Trevinos accountable for their actions, which complies with the purpose of the Juvenile Justice Act.</block_quote>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined the District's evidence regarding the workers' wages was a recoverable expense under RCW <cross_reference>13.40.020</cross_reference>(22). Affirmed.

A majority of the panel has determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>.
