PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Phillip Parkhurst appeals the sentence imposed following his conviction for first degree criminal trespass, arguing that the judgment and sentence fails to impose a definite term of probation. The State, on the other hand, contends the court did not impose probation at all because it crossed out a paragraph in the judgment and sentence describing probation supervision and providing a space for the length of the probationary term. We agree with Parkhurst.

The court suspended the sentence in this case "pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>9.95.200</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>9.95.210</cross_reference>." Those statutes authorize a court to suspend a sentence "[i]n granting probation [.]" Thus, by citing these statutes and suspending Parkhurst's sentence on certain conditions, the court imposed probation. Although it is unclear why the court crossed out the paragraph relating to probation supervision, <footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> it does not change the fact that Parkhurst is on probation. Because probation may be imposed for a term "not exceeding the<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
maximum term of sentence or two years, whichever is longer," RCW <cross_reference>9.95.210</cross_reference>, and because the court failed to indicate the length of probation, <footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> we remand for imposition of a definite term of probation and clarification of the court's intent in crossing out paragraph (2) of the judgment and sentence. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v.</underline><underline>Broadaway</underline>, <cross_reference>133 Wn.2d 118</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>136</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>942 P.2d 363</cross_reference> (1997) (where sentence was insufficiently specific as to period of community placement, remand was required for amendment of the judgment and sentence).

Remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> At sentencing, the prosecutor indicated that "this is not going to be a supervised probation case[.]" Thus, it appears that the probation supervision paragraph may have been crossed out simply to indicate that Parkhurst would not be actively supervised.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> We note that in its oral ruling, the court clearly imposed a term of 12 months probation, stating: "As far as the length of probation, I think 12 months is sufficient rather than the request for the 24."</footnote_body>
