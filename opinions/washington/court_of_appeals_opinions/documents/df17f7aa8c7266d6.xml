<opinion_text><unpublished>  John Eldrid Gray appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to modify his 1998 sentence. We affirm. On November 21, 1996, Gray burglarized Northern Lights Bingo in Longview, Washington. On December 6, 1996, the State charged Gray with second-degree burglary. Fourteen months later, Gray pleaded guilty to burglary and bail jumping. On February 10, 1998, Gray was sentenced. He had several previous convictions and an offender score of 16 without counting his current convictions. He did not ask the trial court to use the drug offender sentencing alternative (DOSA), undoubtedly because he did not qualify for that alternative under the statutes then in effect.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The trial court imposed 51 months in prison, the low end of the standard range, to run consecutively with Gray's sentence on an Arizona conviction. On March 13, 2001, Gray moved for a DOSA sentence. On April 17, 2001, the trial court found that his motion was untimely under CrR 7.8 and RCW <cross_reference>10.73.090</cross_reference>. Gray now appeals. At oral argument, he claimed that his motion was not untimely because of RCW <cross_reference>10.73.100</cross_reference>(2) and, we will assume, RCW <cross_reference>10.73.100</cross_reference>(6).<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> With respect to the merits, he argues that he has not received equal protection of the laws.

<center>                                 Timeliness</center>
RCW <cross_reference>10.73.090</cross_reference> requires, in effect, that a motion to reopen an otherwise final judgment (i.e., a motion to collaterally attack a judgment) be brought within one year. RCW <cross_reference>10.73.100</cross_reference>(2) makes the one-year limit inapplicable if "[t]he statute that the defendant was convicted of violating was unconstitutional on its face or as applied to the defendant's conduct[.]" RCW <cross_reference>10.73.100</cross_reference>(6) makes the one-year limit inapplicable if "[t]here has been a significant change in the law" that either the legislature or a court finds should operate retroactively. CrR 7.8(b) incorporates the same limits.

The statutes under which Gray was convicted were the burglary and bail jumping statutes, and, we will assume without so holding, the DOSA statute in effect in 1998. Gray does not claim or show that any of these was unconstitutional on its face. Thus, RCW <cross_reference>10.73.100</cross_reference>(2) does not apply here.

The change in the law upon which Gray relies is the legislature's 1999 amendment to the DOSA statute.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Neither the legislature nor a court has stated that the amendment is retroactive; on the contrary, all three divisions of the Court of Appeals have held that it is not retroactive.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> RCW <cross_reference>10.73.100</cross_reference>(6) does not apply here, and Gray's motion to reopen his sentence was not timely.

<center>                                   Merits</center>
Even if Gray's motion had been timely, his right to equal protection has not been violated. A statute violates the equal protection clause only if the legislature had no rational basis for creating the classifications it used.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> A statute is presumed constitutional, and a party claiming to the contrary has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Here then, Gray must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature had no rational basis for applying the 1999 DOSA amendment prospectively but not retroactively, so as to distinguish between (a) a class of pre-amendment offenders and (b) a class of post-amendment offenders.

The legislature might have restricted its 1999 DOSA amendment to prospective application for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to a lack of sufficient funds to accommodate all offenders, a lack sufficient treatment resources to accommodate all offenders, and a lack of sufficient judicial resources to re-open and revise the sentences of offenders whose sentences were already final. Gray has not shown that any of these reasons is not a rational basis for distinguishing between pre-amendment offenders and post-amendment offenders. Accordingly, he has not shown the absence of a rational basis or a violation of equal protection.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.

HOUGHTON and BRIDGEWATER, JJ., concur.
