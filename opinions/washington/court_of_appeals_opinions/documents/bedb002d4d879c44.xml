<center>                                  FACTS</center>
On September 7, 2004, Washington State University Police Officer Joe Ederer and Sergeant George McGinty were dispatched to an apartment to investigate a possible burglary. When they arrived at the scene, Officer Ederer spoke with a witness who said that he was awakened by the sound of breaking glass in an apartment located directly above his apartment. The witness said that he saw someone breaking glass and putting the glass into a trash can outside of the apartment. He also said that he saw someone walking to the apartment after he heard the breaking glass. A witness saw the suspect leaving the area.

Sergeant McGinty left to look for any fleeing suspects, while Officer Ederer went to confirm damage to the apartment. When Officer Ederer arrived at the apartment, he noticed a trash can outside the residence and broken glass. The door was propped open with a pair of slippers and there were pry marks on the door. Officer Ederer contacted Sergeant McGinty and asked him to come to the apartment so that they could enter the apartment together for safety reasons. When the Sergeant arrived, the officers knocked on the door twice, identified themselves and commanded that anyone inside the apartment come out. Hearing no response, the officers then entered the apartment with their guns drawn, and conducted a security sweep of any areas large enough to contain a person hiding or injured.

The officers were in the apartment for less than two minutes when Sergeant McGinty saw a marijuana grow operation. The officers then left the apartment and contacted the Pullman Police Department about the marijuana. Officers from the Pullman Police Department obtained a search warrant and seized plant-growing chemicals, 15 marijuana plants, several copies of a purported authorization for Mr. Barber to use medical marijuana, dried marijuana leaves, hydroponic plant growers, water bongs, knives and scissors containing green and black residue, a shot glass with numerous marijuana joint butts, a vacuum sealer and bags, grow lights, sheets of Mylar reflective material, a power converter, two circulation fans, a digital temperature control box and marijuana seeds.

While police officers were at the apartment, Mr. Barber arrived and asked the officers what was going on. Mr. Barber told the officers that he was watching the apartment for his friend. He said the marijuana and equipment belonged to him and that he was growing the marijuana for medical use. He then showed the officers a medical marijuana authorization form signed by Dr. David Dodge, an Oregon-licensed physician. Mr. Barber was arrested and charged with one count of manufacture of a controlled substance — marijuana.

On November 18, Mr. Barber filed a motion to dismiss the charge. He argued that the facts did not establish a prima facie case and that he met the requirements of the affirmative defense under the Medical Use of Marijuana Act, chapter <cross_reference>69.51A</cross_reference> RCW. Mr. Barber also filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained during the search of the apartment. He argued that the police officers lacked legal grounds to initiate a search of the property, because medical marijuana authorization paperwork was posted throughout the apartment.

On January 18, 2005, the court denied Mr. Barber's motion to dismiss. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the crime of manufacture of a controlled substance — marijuana, and that there was no evidence that Mr. Barber met the requirements of the Medical Use of Marijuana Act, because he was not a "qualifying patient" under the statute. Clerk's Papers at 92. The court also denied the motion to suppress, finding that the police officers' initial entry into the apartment was valid pursuant to the emergency and exigency exceptions to the warrant requirement.

Mr. Barber was found guilty as charged at a bench trial. This appeal follows.

<center>                                ANALYSIS</center>
A. Motion to Suppress

Mr. Barber contends the court erred by denying his motion to suppress. He argues the warrantless entry into the apartment constituted an invalid search and did not meet the requirements for the exigent circumstances and emergency exceptions to the warrant requirement.

The <cross_reference>Fourth</cross_reference> Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Washington State Constitution prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Johnson</italic>, <cross_reference>104 Wn. App. 409</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>414</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>16 P.3d 680</cross_reference>, <italic>review</italic><italic>denied</italic>, <cross_reference>143 Wn.2d 1024</cross_reference> (2001). Although warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, the warrant requirement is subject to narrowly drawn exceptions. <italic>Id.</italic> The State has the burden of proving one of these exceptions applies. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Kull</italic>, <cross_reference>155 Wn.2d 80</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>85</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>118 P.3d 307</cross_reference> (2005).

Exigent circumstances may establish an exception to the search warrant requirement where there is probable cause to believe a crime is being or has been committed and it is impractical to obtain a search warrant. <italic>State v. Muir</italic>,<cross_reference>67 Wn. App. 149</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>152</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>835 P.2d 1049</cross_reference> (1992). Our Supreme Court has enumerated six elements to aid in determining when a justification exists for warrantless police entry into a home: "(1) a grave offense, particularly a crime of violence, is involved; (2) the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed; (3) there is reasonably trustworthy information that the suspect is guilty; (4) there is strong reason to believe that the suspect is on the premises; (5) the suspect is likely to escape if not swiftly apprehended; and (6) the entry is made peaceably." <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Terrovona</italic>, <cross_reference>105 Wn.2d 632</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>644</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>716 P.2d 295</cross_reference> (1986).

Likewise, the emergency exception to the warrant requirement "recognizes the community caretaking function of police officers, and exists so officers can assist citizens and protect property." <italic>State v. Menz</italic>, <cross_reference>75 Wn. App. 351</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>353</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>880 P.2d 48</cross_reference> (1994), <italic>review denied</italic>, <cross_reference>125 Wn.2d 1021</cross_reference> (1995). This emergency doctrine justifies a warrantless entry when: "(1) the officer subjectively believed that someone likely needed assistance for health or safety reasons; (2) a reasonable person in the same situation would similarly believe that there was a need for assistance; and (3) there was a reasonable basis to associate the need for assistance with the place searched."<italic>State v. Gocken</italic>, <cross_reference>71 Wn. App. 267</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>276-77</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>857 P.2d 1074</cross_reference>
(1993), <italic>review denied</italic>, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d 1024</cross_reference> (1994).

We find <italic>State v. Campbell</italic>, <cross_reference>15 Wn. App. 98</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>547 P.2d 295</cross_reference> (1976), and <italic>State v. Bakke</italic>, <cross_reference>44 Wn. App. 830</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>723 P.2d 534</cross_reference> (1986), <italic>review denied</italic>, <cross_reference>107 Wn.2d 1033</cross_reference> (1987) instructive here.

In <italic>Campbell</italic>, <cross_reference>15 Wn. App. at 99</cross_reference>, the defendant's neighbor summoned the police after observing a burglary in progress and watching a suspect flee the scene. Upon arrival, the police spoke with the neighbor and discovered a broken window and a wide-open door at the burglarized apartment.<italic>Id.</italic> The officer immediately entered the apartment without a warrant "to investigate the recent crime, to look for possible participants in the burglary, to search for evidence of the burglary, and to aid any victims." <italic>Id.</italic> During the search, seven marijuana plants were discovered. <italic>Id.</italic>
Division One of this court found the search to be valid, concluding that it met the emergency or exigent circumstances exception. <italic>Id.</italic> at 100. The court stated:

<block_quote>  It is reasonable for officers, responding to a request for police assistance and with probable cause to believe that an open, unsecured dwelling has been recently burglarized, to immediately enter the dwelling without a warrant for the limited purposes of investigating the crime, rendering aid to any possible victims of the felony, protecting the occupant's property, and searching for remaining suspects.</block_quote>

<italic>Id.</italic>

Similarly, in <italic>Bakke</italic>, <cross_reference>44 Wn. App. at 831</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>842</cross_reference>, Division One reversed a suppression order and dismissal of charges in a case in which the defendant's neighbor summoned the police to respond to a burglary in progress. The neighbor had seen two juveniles running from the back door of the defendant's home.<italic>Id.</italic> at 831. Upon arrival, the police spoke with neighbors and discovered that the window in the back door to the defendant's house had been broken and that the hole was large enough to accommodate a juvenile's body. <italic>Id.</italic> The police also noted that fresh muddy footprints extended from the back door through an enclosed porch to an interior door that had been broken from the door jamb. <italic>Id.</italic>

Without a warrant, the officers entered the house "to locate any suspects and secure the safety of the house and its contents." <italic>Id.</italic> at 832. They found no suspects but saw two marijuana plants and some grow paraphernalia. <italic>Id.</italic>
Based on these facts, the officers obtained a warrant to search the house. <italic>Id.</italic> During the follow-up search, they found several marijuana plants and a grow light. <italic>Id.</italic> The trial court suppressed this evidence, concluding that the initial search was illegal and that the warrant was issued on the basis of evidence found in an illegal search. <italic>Id.</italic>
On review, Division One reversed concluding that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless search. <italic>Id.</italic>
at 841-42.

Here, Officer Ederer and Sergeant McGinty were responding to a report from a third party who had witnessed a possible burglary in progress. When they arrived, Officer Ederer was told by the witness that the suspect was seen leaving the area. Sergeant McGinty left to look for any fleeing suspects while Officer Ederer stayed at the apartment. Officer Ederer noticed broken glass, the door to the apartment was open and there were pry marks on the door. There was no response when the officers knocked and announced themselves, so the officers entered the apartment to conduct a security sweep to look for possible victims. Taking all of these facts together, the officers clearly had reason to investigate the situation and enter the apartment without a warrant under either the emergency or exigent circumstances exceptions. Their inadvertent discovery of a marijuana grow operation provided probable cause for the subsequent warrant. The court did not err in denying Mr. Barber's motion to suppress evidence found during this search.

<block_quote>  B. Repeal of Schedule I Designation by the Medical Use of Marijuana Act</block_quote>

Mr. Barber contends his conviction must be reversed because the Medical Use of Marijuana Act, chapter <cross_reference>69.51A</cross_reference> RCW, has effectively repealed the designation of marijuana as a schedule I controlled substance under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, chapter <cross_reference>69.50</cross_reference> RCW. He argues that marijuana now has an accepted medical use so that the continued classification of the substance under schedule I is inconsistent and cannot be reconciled with the Medical Use of Marijuana Act. We have already addressed the issue raised by Mr. Barber. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Hanson</italic>, <cross_reference>138 Wn. App. 322</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>157 P.3d 438</cross_reference> (2007).

In <italic>Hanson</italic>, we held that the schedule I classification was not repealed by implication by the Medical Use of Marijuana Act, as the two statutes are not inconsistent. <italic>Id.</italic>
at 330-31. We reasoned that (1) the Medical Use of Marijuana Act does not cover the entire scope of schedule I controlled substances; (2) the Medical Use of Marijuana Act only provides an affirmative defense to certain drug crimes and is not inconsistent with marijuana's schedule I classification; and (3) the legislative intent of the Medical Use of Marijuana Act makes clear that the statute shall not be construed to supersede Washington state law prohibiting the acquisition, possession, manufacture, sale or use of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.<italic>Id.</italic>

Under <italic>Hanson</italic>, therefore, the Medical Use of Marijuana Act was not intended to supersede existing Washington law regarding marijuana use for nonmedical purposes and has not repealed the schedule I designation of marijuana under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. <italic>Id.</italic> Reversal of Mr. Barber's conviction is not warranted on this basis.

C. Statement of Additional Grounds for Review

In his statement of additional grounds for review, Mr. Barber contends the court erred by finding that he was not a "qualifying patient" under the affirmative defense in the Medical Use of Marijuana Act.

The Medical Use of Marijuana Act ensures that "[q]ualifying patients with terminal or debilitating illnesses who, in the judgment of their physicians, would benefit from the medical use of marijuana, shall not be found guilty of a crime under state law for their possession and limited use of marijuana." RCW <cross_reference>69.51A.005</cross_reference>. To be considered a "qualifying patient" under the act, the defendant must prove that he:

<block_quote>  (a) Is a patient of a physician licensed under chapter <cross_reference>18.71</cross_reference> or <cross_reference>18.57</cross_reference> RCW;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (b) Has been diagnosed by that physician as having a terminal or debilitating medical condition;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (c) Is a resident of the state of Washington at the time of such diagnosis;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (d) Has been advised by that physician about the risks and benefits of the medical use of marijuana; and</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (e) Has been advised by that physician that they may benefit from the medical use of marijuana.</block_quote>

RCW <cross_reference>69.51A.010</cross_reference>(3). Only patients of physicians validly licensed in Washington qualify for this defense. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Tracy</italic>, <cross_reference>158 Wn.2d 683</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>690</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>147 P.3d 559</cross_reference> (2006).

Once an individual is deemed a "qualifying patient," he may then assert the affirmative defense to prosecution, provided that he shall:

<block_quote>  (a) Meet all criteria for status as a qualifying patient;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (b) Possess no more marijuana than is necessary for the patient's personal, medical use, not exceeding the amount necessary for a sixty-day supply; and</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (c) Present his or her valid documentation to any law enforcement official who questions the patient regarding his or her medical use of marijuana.</block_quote>

RCW <cross_reference>69.51A.040</cross_reference>(2).

Here, Mr. Barber's medical marijuana authorization was signed by Dr. David Dodge, who is licensed in Oregon, not Washington. In order for Mr. Barber to be considered a "qualifying patient" for purposes of the Medical Use of Marijuana Act, the authorization had to come from a Washington licensed physician.<italic>Tracy</italic>, <cross_reference>158 Wn.2d at 690</cross_reference>. The court did not err in concluding that Mr. Barber was not a "qualifying patient" under the act.

<center>                               CONCLUSION</center>
We hold Officer Ederer and Sergeant McGinty were justified in their entry into the apartment without a warrant under both the emergency and exigent circumstances exceptions. We also hold that the Medical Use of Marijuana Act does not repeal the schedule I designation of marijuana under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, and that Mr. Barber was not a "qualifying patient" under the act because his medical marijuana authorization was not signed by a Washington licensed physician.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>.
