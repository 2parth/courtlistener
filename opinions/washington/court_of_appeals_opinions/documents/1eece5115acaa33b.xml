<opinion_text><unpublished>  In an earlier appeal, Mario Iob challenged the inclusion of two juvenile convictions in his offender score. This court accepted the State's concession of error, reversed Iob's sentence, and remanded for resentencing. On appeal from that resentencing, Iob again contends that the sentencing court miscalculated his offender score. We disagree and affirm.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

In August 1991, Iob pleaded guilty to one count of second degree robbery (Count I) and one count of attempting to elude (Count II). At sentencing, the court calculated Iob's offender score to be 9 for Count I and 8 for Count II. Apparently, both the State and the sentencing court overlooked a prior adult felony conviction that was included in Iob's criminal history or failed to consider the other current offense. Iob's offender score should have been 10 for Count I and 9 for Count II.

Iob appealed, arguing that the sentencing court had erroneously included two juvenile convictions in his offender score.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The State conceded that the juvenile convictions should not have been included in Iob's offender score and that the sentence should be vacated for a new sentencing hearing using the corrected offender score. The State also asserted, incorrectly, that without the juvenile convictions, Iob's offender score for both counts would have been 7. In a decision filed June 17, 2002, this court accepted the State's concession that the juvenile convictions should not have been included in Iob's offender score, reversed Iob's sentence, and remanded the matter for resentencing. See State v. Iob, No. 49197-1-I (June 17, 2002) (Iob I).

At resentencing on July 26, 2002, the State informed the court that Iob's offender score for both Count I and Count II, without inclusion of the juvenile convictions, was 8. The deputy prosecutor then recited Iob's seven prior adult convictions and the State's understanding of the standard ranges, based on an offender score of 8. Both defense counsel and Iob affirmatively acknowledged that the offender score was not in dispute. The sentencing court then imposed standard-range sentences, based on an offender score of 8. On appeal, Iob does not allege that the sentencing court miscalculated his offender score. Rather, he contends that this court's acceptance of the State's concession in Iob I necessarily encompassed the State's erroneous assertion that Iob's offender score was 7. Iob maintains that the sentencing court on remand was therefore precluded by the doctrines of collateral estoppel and law of the case and by the prohibition against double jeopardy from calculating an offender score higher than 7 and that its "sole function was to subtract the erroneous points from the previously determined scores, which yielded scores of 7."<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Nothing in the plain language of Iob I provides any support for these contentions.

This court's decision in Iob I clearly identifies the error and the State's concession as involving the inclusion of two juvenile convictions in Iob's offender score, in violation of State v. Smith. The court then directed that Iob's sentence be reversed "and the matter remanded for resentencing."<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> Nothing in the court's language implies acceptance of the State's erroneous calculation of Iob's offender score.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> Because all of Iob's arguments on appeal rest on a misreading of Iob I, his challenges to the offender score based on double jeopardy, collateral estoppel, and law of the case also fail. We note, however, that the double jeopardy clause does not generally prohibit review of an allegedly erroneous sentence, and there is no per se rule against increasing such a sentence.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Consequently, "the double jeopardy clause does not bar a court from correcting its sentencing error by increasing the severity of a sentence to conform to the mandatory provisions of a statute."<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> Nor has Iob alleged that he had a legitimate expectation of finality in the original sentence.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> Iob has therefore failed to identify any double jeopardy violation. Iob's arguments based on the discretionary law of the case doctrine are equally misplaced. The "law of the case" doctrine generally refers to "the binding effect of determinations made by the appellate court on further proceedings in the trial court on remand."<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>
The sole issue considered and addressed in Iob I was the inclusion of Iob's juvenile convictions in his offender score. Iob fails to address the sentencing court's discretion to consider on remand an issue that was not raised in the first appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> In summary, nothing in Iob I limited the sentencing court's authority on remand to correct the earlier legal error in calculating Iob's offender score. Because Iob has failed to identify any error in his offender score, we need not address the State's claim that Iob waived any challenge by affirmatively agreeing to his offender score at sentencing.

Affirmed.
