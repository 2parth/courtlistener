<opinion_text><unpublished>  Tacoma Police officers stopped Andrew Mike Johns as he exited an alley in the Hilltop neighborhood of Tacoma. The officers believed a narcotics transaction had occurred between Johns and another male. As one officer patted down Johns, a plastic baggie fell out of Johns's hand The State charged Johns with unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and a jury found him guilty. He appeals his conviction. Finding no error, we affirm.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>
On March 4, 2003, as part of a special emphasis team (SET),<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Tacoma Police Department Officers Chris Karl, Ryan Larsen, and Dave Johnson worked together targeting narcotics activity in the Tacoma Hilltop neighborhood. Officer Karl observed Andrew Johns and another male making quick hand-to-hand exchanges, consistent with drug transactions, in an alley near the intersection of South 13th and Tacoma Avenue.

As Johns and a female companion walked westbound up the hill, Officers Karl and Larsen approached them. Officer Karl asked Johns to face the fence that was in front of them and advised Johns that he was going to pat him down to check for weapons for the purpose of officer safety. As Johns placed his hands on his head, a plastic baggie fell out of his left hand and at Officer Karl's feet. The officer picked up the bag and observed 20 to 30 pieces of an off-white substance inside the baggie.

Officer Karl then placed Johns in handcuffs and advised him of his rights. While searching Johns prior to his arrest, Officer Karl found $420 in Johns's front pants pockets. The officer found no drug paraphernalia on Johns for using the cocaine. The State subsequently charged Johns with unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.

Before trial, the court conducted a CrR 3.6 hearing. The State called Officer Karl as a witness at the suppression hearing. Officer Karl explained his training and experience in the area of narcotics. He stated that he had made several hundred narcotic-related arrests and explained that he spent his first three years with the Tacoma Police Department working the Hilltop area. On March 4, Officer Karl and two other officers worked the corner of South 13th and Tacoma Avenue after the neighborhood block watch informed the officers that narcotic deals were occurring in that area.

Officer Karl explained that he saw Johns and the other male engaged in a hand-to-hand motion, which he believed to be a narcotics deal. He testified one thing an officer looks for in drug transactions is `[p]eople exchanging items with one hand and the other person grabbing it and exchanging something back and forth.' Report of Proceedings at 9. Based on this training and experience, the officer decided to approach Johns because he believed that he had observed a narcotics transaction.

The trial court ruled that based on Officer Karl's training and experience and that the area where the stop occurred was identified as a high narcotic trafficking area, Officer Karl's initial stop of Johns was reasonable.

At trial, Officer Karl's testimony was consistent with his testimony given during the CrR 3.6 hearing. He further stated that during his search of Johns incident to arrest, he found no drug paraphernalia on Johns. This led him to conclude that Johns was a dealer and not a user.

John Dunn, a forensic scientist with the Washington State Patrol Crime Laboratory, also testified that the substance found inside the plastic baggie was cocaine and that it weighed 5.9 grams prior to testing.

Johns testified that he was a drug user and had used crack cocaine for a year and a half. He explained that the drugs he had on March 4 were for his own use and that he used approximately $100 to $200 worth of cocaine each day. He explained that his grandmother had given him $300 or $400 for being her caretaker. The jury found Johns guilty of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. He now appeals his conviction.

Johns argues the trial court incorrectly included washed-out juvenile convictions in his offender score. We disagree.

Prior to 2002, State v. Cruz, <cross_reference>139 Wn.2d 186</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>985 P.2d 384</cross_reference> (1999), and State v. Smith, <cross_reference>144 Wn.2d 665</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>30 P.3d 1245</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>39 P.3d 294</cross_reference> (2001), were the controlling law regarding washed-out convictions. In Cruz, our supreme court held that a change to the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) could not revive previously washed-out convictions in order to include them in the offender score for a current offense. Cruz, <cross_reference>139 Wn.2d at 191-93</cross_reference>. In 2001, the supreme court looked at this issue again when it determined that the 1997 amendments to the SRA did not revive juvenile convictions that had washed out before the statutory change in 1997. Smith,<cross_reference>144 Wn.2d at 674-75</cross_reference>.

In 2002, the legislature responded to Smith by enacting further amendments to the SRA. The legislature enacted a new statutory provision, RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.525</cross_reference>(18), which clearly stated the legislature's intent to include washed-out convictions in later offender scores. The legislature also changed the definition of `[c]riminal history' in RCW<cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(13) to include language stating that a conviction could only be removed from a defendant's `criminal history' if `it is vacated pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>9.96.060</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>9.94A.640</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>9.95.240</cross_reference>, or a similar out-of-state statute, or if the conviction has been vacated pursuant to a governor's pardon.' RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(13)(b). The amendments to RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.030</cross_reference>(13)(b) and RCW<cross_reference>9.94A.525</cross_reference>(18) took effect on June 13, 2002. Laws of 2002, ch. <cross_reference>107</cross_reference>, sec. 4.

Johns asserts that even though the amendments to the SRA occurred before his offense, the amendments cannot revive prior washed-out juvenile convictions. The supreme court recently decided this issue.

In State v. Varga, <cross_reference>151 Wn.2d 179</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>190</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>86 P.3d 139</cross_reference> (2004), the supreme court considered whether the legislature could amend the SRA to include a defendant's previously washed-out convictions as part of the defendant's criminal history. Varga argued that in order for the amendments to apply retroactively, the legislature had to provide a statement showing its retroactive intent. Varga, <cross_reference>151 Wn.2d at 190</cross_reference>. The supreme court disagreed with Varga's argument. Instead, the court found that the amendments explicitly stated that previously washed-out convictions were to be considered part of a defendant's criminal history. Varga,<cross_reference>151 Wn.2d at 191</cross_reference>. It also found that the legislature directed sentencing courts to consider a defendant's previously washed-out convictions when calculating the defendant's offender score where the current version of the SRA required consideration of that type of conviction. Varga,<cross_reference>151 Wn.2d at 191</cross_reference>.

Johns committed his offense on March 4, 2003. The 2002 amendments were in effect at that time. RCW <cross_reference>9.94A.345</cross_reference> directs the court to impose a sentence under the SRA using the law in effect at the time of the commission of the current offense. The 2002 amendments required the trial court to consider Johns's washed-out convictions in his offender score. Thus, the trial court did not err when it calculated Johns's offender score.

<center>                       II. Suppression of Evidence</center>
Johns contends the trial court erred by failing to suppress evidence seized as part of an improper investigatory stop. We disagree.

We review findings of facts regarding a motion to suppress under the substantial evidence standard. State v. Mendez, <cross_reference>137 Wn.2d 208</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>214</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>970 P.2d 722</cross_reference> (1999). Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to convince a reasonable person of the truth of the trial court's finding. Mendez, <cross_reference>137 Wn.2d at 214</cross_reference>.

An investigatory stop is justified where a police officer can `point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.' Terry v. Ohio, <cross_reference>392 U.S. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>21</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>88 S. Ct. 1868</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>20 L. Ed. 2d 889</cross_reference> (1968). `[A] substantial possibility that criminal conduct has occurred or is about to occur' is the level of articulable suspicion necessary to support an investigative detention. State v. Kennedy, <cross_reference>107 Wn.2d 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>6</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>726 P.2d 445</cross_reference>
(1986).

We evaluate the totality of circumstances presented to the investigating officer when reviewing the merits of an investigatory stop. United States v. Cortez, <cross_reference>449 U.S. 411</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>101 S. Ct. 690</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>66 L. Ed. 2d 621</cross_reference> (1981). We take into account an officer's experience when determining the reasonableness of a Terry stop. State v. Mercer,<cross_reference>45 Wn. App. 769</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>774</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>727 P.2d 676</cross_reference> (1986). We consider three factors to determine whether an intrusion is permissible under Terry or must be supported by probable cause: (1) the purpose of the stop; (2) the amount of physical intrusion on the suspect's liberty; and (3) the length of time the suspect is detained. State v. Williams, <cross_reference>102 Wn.2d 733</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>740</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>689 P.2d 1065</cross_reference> (1984). The facts here do not amount to an improper stop under Terry.

Officer Karl had extensive training on narcotics investigations and arrests. He had made several hundred narcotic related arrests of both dealers and users. He had observed several hundred drug transactions. Officer Karl knew the location of the arrest because he spent his first three years with the Tacoma Police Department working the Hilltop area, an area known as an extremely high narcotics area. Additionally, neighbors had recently complained about drug dealing in the area, specifically in the alley where Officer Karl observed Johns.

Officer Karl testified that after observing Johns and the other male, his experience led him to the conclusion that a drug deal had occurred and that was the reason he contacted Johns. Further, there was minimal physical intrusion on Johns's liberty. Officer Karl contacted Johns as he walked up a hill. Finally, the officer did not detain Johns for an unreasonable amount of time. Once Johns dropped the baggie of drugs in plain view, the officer had probable cause to arrest Johns. Substantial evidence supports the trial court's decision to admit the drug evidence seized during the investigatory stop.

<center>                         III. Opinion Testimony</center>
It is within a trial court's wide discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. See State v. Rivers, <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d 697</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>709-10</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>921 P.2d 495</cross_reference> (1996). We only reverse a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence where the defendant establishes that the trial court abused its discretion. Rivers, <cross_reference>129 Wn.2d at 709-10</cross_reference>. A trial court abuses its discretion when no reasonable person would adopt the view the trial court advocated. State v. Sutherland, <cross_reference>3 Wn. App. 20</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>21</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>472 P.2d 584</cross_reference>, review denied, <cross_reference>78 Wn.2d 996</cross_reference> (1970).

Johns asserts the trial court erred by admitting Officer Karl's opinion testimony. We disagree.

Generally, no witness, lay or expert, can testify regarding his opinion of a defendant's guilt whether by inference or direct statement. State v. Black, <cross_reference>109 Wn.2d 336</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>348</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>745 P.2d 12</cross_reference> (1987). But testimony that is neither a direct comment on the defendant's guilt or on the truthfulness of the witness, that is `otherwise helpful to the jury,' and is based on the expert's inferences from the evidence is not considered improper opinion testimony. City of Seattle v. Heatley, <cross_reference>70 Wn. App. 573</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>578</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>854 P.2d 658</cross_reference> (1993), review denied, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d 1011</cross_reference> (1994). Such is our situation.

Officer Karl formed his opinions about Johns based on his experience with narcotics and narcotics transactions. His testimony contained no opinion of Johns's guilt. Officer Karl merely stated that it was his opinion that a drug transaction had occurred involving Johns and that Johns was likely a dealer and not a drug user because the officer found no drug paraphernalia on Johns. Officer Karl's experience with narcotics helped him to form these conclusions. As the State correctly argues, Officer Karl's opinion was proper because it was an inference based solely on the physical evidence and his experience. The officer did not explicitly state an opinion on Johns's guilt or credibility. State v. Sanders, <cross_reference>66 Wn. App. 380</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>388-89</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>832 P.2d 1326</cross_reference> (1992). The jury still had the ultimate job of determining guilt. The trial court did not err by admitting Officer Karl's opinion testimony.

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.
