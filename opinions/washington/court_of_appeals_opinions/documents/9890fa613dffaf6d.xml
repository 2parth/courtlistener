<opinion_text><unpublished>  Cyrus Plush appeals his conviction of custodial assault. We affirm.

On January 10, 2000, Plush was a trustee the Lewis County Jail when he made an angry remark to a kitchen employee. The shift supervisor, Roger Pendergrass, told Plush he would be removed as a trustee. Plush began swearing, so Pendergrass put him in a holding cell to cool off. Plush hit the door of the holding cell several times, and Sergeant Kevin Hanson told him that unless he stopped, he would be put into the restraint chair. Plush hit the door again, so Hanson, Pendergrass, Officer Kevin Dickey, and two other officers put him into the restraint chair. As they were doing that, Plush spit on Hanson and Dickey. According to Pendergrass' later testimony, it was Hanson who decided to use the chair.

The State charged Plush with two counts of third degree assault. On the day of trial, the State amended to charge two counts of custodial assault in violation of RCW <cross_reference>9A.36.100</cross_reference>(1)(b). During the ensuing bench trial, the State's witnesses testified as just set forth. Plush testified that the pain the officers were inflicting on him caused him to spit involuntarily. An inmate named Jeffrey Jones testified that Plush was screaming in pain as the officers were putting him in the restraint chair.

The trial court convicted, finding that Plush spit intentionally. I. Plush argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for custodial assault. A person is guilty of that crime if he or she assaults a staff member of an adult corrections institution who is performing official duties. The evidence is sufficient to prove that crime if, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it permits any rational trier of fact to find each of its essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Plush claims that the evidence is insufficient because it does not show that Hanson and Dickey were performing official duties when he spit on them. He reasons that the jail's rules required Pendergrass to authorize the use of the restraint chair; that Pendergrass did not do so; and thus that Hanson and Dickey were not performing `official duties' when he spit on them. Non-compliance with jail rules does not necessarily mean that an officer is not performing his official duties. Assuming without conceding that it does, however, the evidence shows compliance here. Although Hanson may have made the initial decision to use the restraint chair, Pendergrass effectively ratified and authorized that use when he helped Hanson and the others put Plush into the chair. The evidence is sufficient to support the conviction.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
II.

Plush argues in his pro se brief that the trial court erred in allowing the State to amend the information to charge custodial assault instead of third degree assault on the first day of trial. The defense made no objection to the amendment at the time.

CrR 2.1(d) provides that an information may be amended before verdict, so long as the amendment does not unduly prejudice the defendant's substantial rights.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> We review an amendment only for abuse of discretion.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

Although Plush claims that the amendment was `illegal,' he does not explain how he was prejudiced. As the State responds, the amendment allowed him to argue that the officers were not acting in their official capacity when they placed him in the restraint chair. Plush has not shown prejudice or an abuse of discretion. III.

At the beginning of trial, the trial court granted Plush's motion to exclude witnesses. After Hanson testified, he remained in the courtroom and heard several other witnesses testify. In rebuttal, he was called to the stand again. Although Plush's counsel did not object to Hanson remaining, or to Hanson again taking the stand, Plush now argues for reversal because Hanson remained in the courtroom.

A party must object so that the trial court has an opportunity to rule.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> Because the defense did not object to Hanson's rebuttal testimony, there is no error to review.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> IV.

Plush also contends that the trial court erred by not finding that he acted in self defense. Preliminarily, Plush testified at trial that he spit at the officers involuntarily due to the pain they were inflicting. He also claimed diminished capacity, i.e., that he lacked capacity to form the required intent. His current position, that he spit in self defense, contradicts his theories at trial.

Assuming without holding that Plush can now make this claim, it is contrary to law. A person may use force to resist a correctional officer only when that person is in actual, imminent danger of serious injury.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>
Plush testified that the officers pulled and twisted his hair, twisted his ankles and feet, and curled his toes under. This does not show the required danger of serious injury, and self defense was not in issue. V.

Finally, Plush contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not call the witnesses he requested, did not cite additional cases at trial or on appeal, did not request a different judge, did not object to Hanson's testimony on rebuttal, and did not argue self defense. To establish ineffective assistance, a defendant must show deficient performance and resulting prejudice.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>
Prejudice is shown when there is a reasonable probability that, except for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>

Here, Plush does not explain what witnesses his attorney failed to call. He does not explain what cases his attorney did not cite at trial or on appeal. He does not show, as already discussed, that a self defense claim could even have been made. He does show that the trial court made a critical remark at sentencing `Mr. Plush keeps doing the same thing, endangering correctional officers time after time, and spitting seems to become one of his favorite forms of assault. It has to stop, and if I have to use the maximum term to at least protect our corrections officers here in Lewis County that is what I am going to do'<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> but that remark does not show that the court was biased or that counsel was deficient by not requesting a different judge. He does not show that the trial court would have excluded Hanson's rebuttal testimony even if counsel had objected, that such testimony added materially to what Hanson had already said during the State's case in chief, or that the exclusion of such testimony would have affected the trial's outcome. Ineffective assistance has not been shown.

Affirmed. The State is granted its costs pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>10.73.160</cross_reference>.

A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>, it is so ordered.
