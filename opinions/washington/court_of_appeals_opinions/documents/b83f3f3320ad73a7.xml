<opinion_text><unpublished>  This action involves an appeal by the primary beneficiary over the fees awarded the law firm representing the personal representative of the estate for defending an action against the estate. He claims that there was a conflict of interest and, thus, the law firm should take nothing. We conclude that the order determining fees was appealable and that appellant has standing to challenge the order. However, we also conclude that appellant has failed to show that an actual conflict of interest existed. Accordingly, we affirm.

Walter King, Jr., was the sole owner, shareholder, and director of King Grain, Inc. (KGI), a grain storage and feed operation. His wife, Naomi King, was bookkeeper for KGI. Walter died August 26, 2001.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Naomi King became personal representative (PR) of the estate when probate was filed one month later. Ms. King took over operation of KGI. She also hired the law firm of Velikanje, Moore  Shore (VMS) to represent her as PR. Walter's son, Rodney King, is the primary beneficiary under Walter King's will. Naomi King, however, was also a beneficiary and succeeded her late husband as owner of KGI.

Mr. Bassani, a customer of KGI, discovered in June 2002 that 2,000 tons of his corn were missing from KGI storage facilities<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> and filed a claim against the estate the next month. He subsequently filed suit against KGI, and Ms. King personally<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> and as personal representative of the estate. VMS undertook representation of the three defendants. The matter proceeded to bench trial before the Honorable Evan Sperline in August 2006. Bassani prevailed against the estate on a bailment theory.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> The judge dismissed claims against KGI and Ms. King individually.

Counsel for Rodney King told VMS in June 2006 that he believed the firm had a conflict representing all three defendants in the Bassani litigation. After the Bassani trial, Ms. King asked the court to permit payment to VMS for attorney fees to date, including $94,831.57 for defense of the Bassani litigation. Counsel for Rodney King objected to that payment on the basis that a conflict of interest had existed at trial. Judge Sperline also heard this action. The court continued the matter 60 days and permitted the parties to submit evidence. The trial court ultimately concluded that the conflict claim was "too theoretical and too speculative" to set aside the fee award. Rodney King then appealed to this court.

<italic>Appealability and Standing</italic>

The estate contends that the fee award is not an appealable order and that Rodney King lacks standing to challenge it. We disagree. RAP 2.2(a)(3) permits an appeal from "Any written decision affecting a substantial right in a civil case that in effect determines the action and prevents a final judgment or discontinues the action." The order awarding fees for the defense of the Bassani litigation discontinued the challenge to that request. It was an appealable decision.

Prior to the adoption of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, it was possible for a beneficiary to appeal similar rulings ordering payment of judgments or fees and costs. <italic>E.g.</italic>, <italic>In re Sullivan's Estate</italic>, <cross_reference>36 Wash. 217</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>223</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>78 Pac. 945</cross_reference> (1904) (orders directing payment to administrator and attorney were final and could be appealed); <italic>In re Richardson's Estate</italic>,<cross_reference>97 Wash. 488</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>490</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>166 Pac. 776</cross_reference> (1917) (order directing administratrix to pay judgment was appealable). We conclude that the order was appealable.

As a beneficiary of the estate, Rodney King had the ability to challenge the reasonableness of payments made by the personal representative. The Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act (TEDRA) is a broad grant of power to the trial courts to act to resolve disputes in the administration of trusts and estates. <italic>See generally</italic> ch. <cross_reference>11.96A</cross_reference> RCW. In particular, RCW 11.96.030 allows a beneficiary<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> to bring a "matter"<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> before the superior court. Accordingly, we believe Rodney King had standing to pursue this action. <italic>Accord, In re Sullivan's Estate</italic>,<cross_reference>36 Wash. at 227</cross_reference> (potential heirs had standing to challenge payments to administrator and attorney under former statutory scheme).

Respondent notes that an attorney hired to assist the personal representative owes a duty to the PR and not the estate or its beneficiaries. Thus, beneficiary status does not create standing to bring a malpractice action against the attorney hired by the PR. <italic>Trask v.</italic><italic>Butler</italic>, <cross_reference>123 Wn.2d 835</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>845</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>872 P.2d 1080</cross_reference> (1994). Respondent therefore argues that Rodney King could not challenge the fees paid to the attorneys for the PR. However, the question presented here is not whether Rodney King would have had standing to intervene in the Bassani litigation or whether the estate needed to be managed for his benefit. The question instead involves whether the trial court properly approved the payment of fees. He has a statutory basis for contesting that decision. Chapter <cross_reference>11.96A</cross_reference> RCW. He therefore has standing to continue that challenge on appeal.

<italic>Conflict of Interest</italic>

Rodney King contends that the three defendants in the Bassani case had conflicting interests and that VMS could not represent each of them. In particular, he theorizes that Naomi King, and she alone, could have been found personally liable to the exclusion of the estate and KGI if the loss was attributed solely to her negligence after the death of Walter King. The trial court found the claim to be "too theoretical and too speculative." We agree.

It was appellant's obligation to establish that an actual conflict of interest existed from the representation of multiple parties. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Dhaliwal</italic>, <cross_reference>150 Wn.2d 559</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>566-573</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>79 P.3d 432</cross_reference> (2003); <italic>Mickens v. Taylor</italic>,<cross_reference>535 U.S. 162</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>152 L. Ed. 2d 291</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>122 S. Ct. 1237</cross_reference> (2002). That he did not do here.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

The defense theory during the Bassani litigation was that only KGI, a corporation without assets, was liable. The trial court found that neither Walter King, when he first began dealing with Mr. Bassani, nor Naomi King, when she dealt with Mr. Bassani after Walter King's death, ever advised Bassani of the corporate nature of the grain storage business. Accordingly, the trial judge determined that there was no basis for finding KGI liable. The court also found that there was "no factual basis for any judgment" against Naomi King individually or as part of a marital community.

Against this factual background, appellant's argument flounders. The plaintiffs in the Bassani action had every incentive to establish individual liability against Naomi King. They were unable to do so. Rodney King posits that Naomi King did not take sufficient efforts to protect the corn after his father's death such as putting locks on the grain bins. There is no indication in this record that any more than 100 of the missing 2,000 tons could have been taken after Ms. King became PR.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> There also is no reason to believe that an employee who had a key for the fence around the grain silos would not have been able to obtain one for the buildings and continue his acts of theft. The grain loss appeared to the trial judge to have occurred over a period of time. It was understandable that he did not find a basis for holding Naomi King liable â€” little, if any, was taken during her watch and there is no basis for concluding that she could have stopped the thefts.

Liability in this case was clear. Mr. Bassani had entrusted his corn to Walter King and paid him to store it. When Mr. King and his successor could not return the entire product, he and his estate were liable for the missing corn. Once the trial court declined to find the corporate entity, KGI, responsible, the ballgame was over. The estate would have to pay. Even if Naomi King somehow personally had contributed to the loss, it would not have lessened the responsibility of the estate. A claim against her simply would not have allowed the estate to escape its joint liability.

Judge Sperline did not err in concluding that the claim of conflict of interest was not established.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>

Affirmed.

A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>.

Sweeney, J., Thompson, J. Pro Tem, concur.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Walter and Naomi had been married approximately three months at the time of death.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> Ms. King had previously fired an employee for stealing grain from KGI.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> From the allegations of the amended complaint, it appears that a primary claim against Naomi King was that she required the plaintiffs to move and sell their corn before they wanted to, causing losses due to low prices at the time. The trial court ultimately rejected this argument.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> Walter King also operated a hog farm and purchased corn from Bassani for feed. Naomi King continued purchasing corn to feed the hogs when she became PR. In addition to determining how much corn was missing from presumed theft, the lawsuit also settled the amount the King estate owed Bassani for the corn it had used.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> RCW <cross_reference>11.96A.030</cross_reference>(4)(e) defines a beneficiary as a "party" for purposes of chapter 11.96A.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn6]</footnote_number> A "`matter' includes any issue, question, or dispute involving: . . . (b) The direction of a personal representative or trustee to do or to abstain from doing any act in a fiduciary capacity; [or] (c) The determination of any question arising in the administration of an estate or trust." RCW <cross_reference>11.96A.030</cross_reference>(1)(b), (c).</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn7]</footnote_number> The fee dispute was heard by the same judge who conducted the Bassani trial. He was able to recall the trial testimony and make findings. This court does not have the benefit of that record. While it is understandable that Rodney King would not want to go to the expense of transcribing the testimony from the Bassani trial, the absence of that record leaves a reviewing court in a difficult position. It is the burden of an appellant to provide an appropriate record for review. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Blight</italic>, <cross_reference>89 Wn.2d 38</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>46-47</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>569 P.2d 1129</cross_reference> (1977). We will not infer facts establishing a conflict of interest from a missing record.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn8]</footnote_number> Some of that total may well have included the corn purchased by King from Bassani.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn9]</footnote_number> In light of our conclusion, we do not have to address whether disgorgement of the entire fee for defense of the trial would have been appropriate if a conflict had existed. The estate may also have benefited from a joint defense of Naomi King as PR and as an individual given the intertwined nature of the allegations. It certainly would have been very hard to segregate the two defenses.</footnote_body>
