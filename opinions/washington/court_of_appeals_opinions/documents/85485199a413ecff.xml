<opinion_text><unpublished>  David Hartmann's car struck Gregory Gorfkle's car, allegedly causing Gorfkle injuries. A few months later Gorfkle's car was struck again, this time by a hit-and-run driver. Gorfkle sued Hartmann and his marital community, and later the parties agreed to include Gorfkle's uninsured motorist claim against his insurer. Gorfkle settled with his insurer the business day before trial. The day trial started, the Hartmanns disclosed that they intended to call one of Gorfkle's insurer's medical experts, but the trial court excluded this evidence. A jury awarded Gorfkle damages. The Hartmanns appeal the trial court's exclusion of the medical expert. The Hartmanns also appeal the trial court's rejection of their proposed jury instructions, which dealt with allocation of fault. We affirm.

<center>                                  FACTS</center>
In March 1999, a car driven by David Hartmann struck a car driven by Gregory Gorfkle. Gorfkle contends that his car was lifted up in the air and spun around, and that he suffered pain all over his body as a result of the accident, particularly in his head, neck, and back. In May of that year, Gorfkle's car was hit again, this time by a hit-and-run driver. Gorfkle claims he was not injured in the May accident, but that the May accident merely aggravated the injuries from the March accident. Gorfkle contends that his pain kept worsening after the first accident. He began seeing a rheumatologist, Dr. Paul Brown, in August 2001. Dr. Brown eventually diagnosed Gorfkle as suffering from fibromyalgia as a result of the March accident.

Gorfkle filed suit against Hartmann and his wife in February 2002 for damages resulting from the March accident. Gorfkle amended his claim in September 2003 to include damages from the May accident and his underinsured motorist (UIM) insurer, Financial Indemnity Company. One of Financial Indemnity's witnesses was Dr. John Dickson, a rheumatologist. Dr. Dickson was only listed as a witness for Financial Indemnity; the Hartmanns did not list him. The Hartmanns listed Dr. Kenneth Briggs, an orthopedist, as their expert. Gorfkle deposed Dr. Dickson; however, Gorfkle and Financial Indemnity settled the business day before trial was to start.

The day trial started, the Hartmanns declared that they intended to call Dr. Dickson. Gorfkle objected, arguing that the Hartmanns had never disclosed that they intended to call Dr. Dickson as a witness, and that Gorfkle would be prejudiced because he settled with Financial Indemnity on the premise that Dr. Dickson was only Financial Indemnity's witness. The Hartmanns contended that parties can share witnesses, that they paid some of Dr. Dickson's fees, and that they would be prejudiced by not being able to call him. The trial court ordered briefing on the issue, and ruled the next day that Dr. Dickson would be excluded.

At trial, David Hartmann admitted fault for the March accident. Before the Hartmanns put on their last witness, the parties and the court discussed proposed jury instructions. The Hartmanns proposed several jury instructions, including both of the following:

<block_quote>  Before a percentage of negligence may be attributed to any entity that is not party to this action, the defendant has the burden of proving each of the following propositions:</block_quote>

First, that the entity was negligent; and

<block_quote>  Second, that the entity's negligence was a proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff.</block_quote>

If you find that more than one entity was negligent, you must determine what percentage of the total negligence is attributable to each entity that proximately caused the injury to the plaintiff. The court will provide you with a special verdict form for this purpose. Your answer to the questions in the special verdict form will furnish the basis by which the court will apportion damages, if any.

Entities may include the defendant or entities not party to the action.

The Hartmanns also submitted a special verdict form that asked the jury to determine whether the Hartmanns and the hit-and-run driver were negligent, whether the negligence proximately caused Gorfkle's injuries, and the percentage of negligence attributable to each tortfeasor. The Hartmanns argued that RCW <cross_reference>4.22.070</cross_reference>
requires that fault be allocated in this case, and required an apportionment instruction. The court did not give the apportionment instructions, nor use the special verdict form. The jury found in favor of Gorfkle and assessed damages in the principal amount of $144,116. The Hartmanns appeal.

<center>                                ANALYSIS</center><center>      I. Motion to Strike Briefing Pertaining to Motions in Limine</center>
Gorfkle contends that, because the Hartmanns do not assign error to the trial court's rulings on motions in limine, the discussion of the motions in limine is not properly before this court under RAP 10.3(g). Thus, Gorfkle claims, we should strike the section of the Hartmanns' brief that references the motions in limine.

In citing RAP 10.3(g), Gorfkle seems to be arguing that because the Hartmanns have not assigned error to the trial court's rulings on the motions in limine, the Hartmanns should not be allowed to reference these rulings at all. This is incorrect. RAP 10.3(g) provides that separate assignments of error must be given for each error claimed, and that an appellate court will only review errors set out in the assignments of error or clearly argued in the briefs. Because the Hartmanns have not assigned error to the rulings on the motions in limine, we do not review those rulings. But Gorfkle has cited no authority to suggest that the Hartmanns may not discuss the rulings in their Statement of Facts, in order to provide context for their arguments. Further, even if the Hartmanns' mention of the rulings violated a Rule of Appellate Procedure, sanctions are appropriate only if the requesting party can show that he or she was prejudiced by the violation. State v. Todd, <cross_reference>101 Wn. App. 945</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>949</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>6 P.3d 86</cross_reference>
(2000), overruled on other grounds by State v. Rangel-Reyes,<cross_reference>119 Wn. App. 494</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>81 P.3d 157</cross_reference> (2003). Gorfkle has not shown that he has been prejudiced by the Hartmanns' discussion.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

<center>          II. Adequacy of Record to Review Exclusion of Witness</center>
The Hartmanns have asserted that the trial court erred in excluding Dr. Dickson from testifying. But Gorfkle claims that the Hartmanns have not preserved this issue for review because they did not make an adequate offer of proof. Gorfkle essentially argues that the Hartmanns did not give the trial court enough specific information as to the nature of Dr. Dickson's offered testimony.

ER 103(a)(2) provides that error may not be predicated on a ruling that excludes evidence unless a substantial right of a party was affected and `the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.' While the details of the testimony need not be apparent, the party offering the evidence must `make clear to the trial court what it is that he offers in proof, and the reasons why he deems the offer admissible over the objections of his opponent, so that the court may make an informed ruling.' State v. Ray, <cross_reference>116 Wn.2d 531</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>539</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>806 P.2d 1220</cross_reference>
(1991).

An offer of proof serves three purposes: it informs the court of the legal theory under which the offered evidence is admissible; it informs the judge of the specific nature of the offered evidence so that the court can assess its admissibility; and it creates a record adequate for review. Ray,<cross_reference>116 Wn.2d at 538</cross_reference>. But an offer of proof is not required if the substance of the excluded evidence is apparent from the record. Ray,<cross_reference>116 Wn.2d at 539</cross_reference>.

In their objection to the exclusion of Dr. Dickson, the Hartmanns state, `If allowed to testify, Dr. Dickson, a rheumatologist, will give his opinion as to the nature and cause of fibromyalgia as it pertains to patient Gorfkle.' While this statement might have been inadequate if Dr. Dickson were being excluded based on the content of his testimony, Dr. Dickson was excluded for other reasons. The trial court excluded Dr. Dickson based on a discovery violation and based on the prejudice to Gorfkle in light of Gorfkle's settlement with the party who had listed Dr. Dickson as a witness; the content of Dr. Dickson's testimony was never at issue. The Hartmanns gave the trial court their reasons why Dr. Dickson should not be excluded. The trial court gave its reasons for excluding the testimony. The record is adequate for review.

<center>                      III. Exclusion of Dr. Dickson</center>
The Hartmanns contend that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Dickson as an expert witness. They assert that Dr. Dickson was timely disclosed and that Gorfkle was prepared for Dr. Dickson's testimony. Moreover, the Hartmanns claim, even if they did violate a rule, the trial court failed to consider a less severe sanction than exclusion.

We review a trial court's decision excluding expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. State v. Willis, <cross_reference>151 Wn.2d 255</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>262</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>87 P.3d 1164</cross_reference> (2004). A trial court abuses its discretion only when its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds or reasons. State ex rel. Carroll v. Junker,<cross_reference>79 Wn.2d 12</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>26</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>482 P.2d 775</cross_reference> (1971). `However, a trial court should not exclude testimony unless there is a showing of intentional or tactical nondisclosure, of willful violation of a court order, or the conduct of the miscreant is otherwise unconscionable.' Barci v. Intalco Aluminum Corp., <cross_reference>11 Wn. App. 342</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>351</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>522 P.2d 1159</cross_reference>
(1974). Violation of a discovery order without a reasonable excuse constitutes a willful violation. Gammon v. Clark Equip. Co., <cross_reference>38 Wn. App. 274</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>280</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>686 P.2d 1102</cross_reference> (1984).

When a trial court does exercise its discretion to sanction a party, the sanction imposed should be the least severe sanction that will accomplish the purpose of the particular sanction given. Washington State Physicians Ins. Exch. v. Fisons Corp.,<cross_reference>122 Wn.2d 299</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>355-56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>858 P.2d 1054</cross_reference> (1993). It must be apparent from the record that the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would have been appropriate, and that it found that the refusal to obey a discovery order was willful or deliberate and substantially prejudiced the opponent. Burnet v. Spokane Ambulance, <cross_reference>131 Wn.2d 484</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>494</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>933 P.2d 1036</cross_reference> (1997).

KCLR (King County Local Rule) 16(a)(4) requires that parties exchange `lists of the witnesses whom each party expects to call at trial,' and provides that `[a]ny witness or exhibit not listed may not be used at trial, unless the Court orders otherwise for good cause and subject to such conditions as justice requires.'<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The parties were also required to file a Joint Statement of Evidence identifying who would be called at trial. KCLR 16(a)(5).<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> The Hartmanns did not comply with the rule. They did not identify Dr. Dickson on either their witness list or their Joint Statement of Evidence. KCLR 16(a)(4) requires exclusion of the witness absent a showing of good cause.

The Hartmanns' position is further undercut by Allied Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Mangum, <cross_reference>72 Wn. App. 164</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>864 P.2d 1</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>871 P.2d 1075</cross_reference> (1994). In that case, the Mangums failed to submit a witness list required by a pre-trial discovery order, and the trial court sanctioned them by refusing to allow them to call any witnesses at trial. Mangum, <cross_reference>72 Wn. App. at 166</cross_reference>. The Mangums argued that they should at least be able to call witnesses listed by the opposing party, as that right is implicit in KCLR 16(a). Mangum,<cross_reference>72 Wn. App. at 167</cross_reference>. The court rejected this argument, stating that the rule requires that a party must list all witnesses it intends to call.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> Mangum, <cross_reference>72 Wn. App. at 167-68</cross_reference>. The court held that `in order to call witnesses at trial, LR 16(a)(3) requires a party to list `any' and all witnesses, including those listed by the opposing party, unless the court orders otherwise for good cause.' Mangum, <cross_reference>72 Wn. App. at 168</cross_reference>. Although Mangum concerned witnesses listed by an opposing party, the rationale applies to witnesses listed by a co-defendant as well.

The Hartmanns claim that the official comment to KCLR 16(a) acknowledges that one party may call another party's witness in a case:

<block_quote>  A party wishing to present the testimony of a witness who has been listed by another party may not rely on the listing party to obtain the witness's attendance at trial. Instead, a subpoena should be served on the witness, unless the party is willing to risk the witness's failure to appear.</block_quote>

Although this statement does imply that parties may share witnesses, it focuses on the need to subpoena the witnesses to be relied upon. It does not relieve a party of the obligation to list witnesses that it intends to call. KCLR 16(a)(4) and (5) establish that parties must exchange witness and exhibit lists and present a Joint Statement of Evidence, all of which must list the witnesses to be called. Further, the comment also indicates that a party must list the witnesses it intends to call:

<block_quote>  All witnesses must be listed, including those whom a party plans to call as a rebuttal witness. The only exception is for witnesses the need for whose testimony cannot reasonable be anticipated before trial; such witnesses obviously cannot be listed ahead of time.</block_quote>

KCLR 16(a) cmt. Thus, the rule and its official comment do not absolve the Hartmanns of their responsibility to comply with discovery orders.

The Hartmanns claim that they reserved their right to call additional witnesses. They note that in the Defendants' Disclosure of Possible Primary Witnesses from February 2003, they reserved `the right to call any witnesses, lay or expert, that may be discovered in further pretrial discovery and/or identified by all other parties.' However, the Hartmanns have produced no authority that says that a reservation of the right to call additional witnesses satisfies the requirement that a party list its witnesses or otherwise negates their obligation to comply with discovery orders as required by KCLR 16.

Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Dickson because it made all of the required findings. Although the trial court did not explicitly state that the Hartmanns' nondisclosure was without reasonable excuse, such a finding is implicit in the statements the trial court made. The court noted that there were numerous opportunities for the Hartmanns to disclose their intention to call Dr. Dickson, including interrogatories that related to expert witnesses that never included Dr. Dickson and were never supplemented to include Dr. Dickson. The court also correctly noted that the Joint Statement of Evidence did not list Dr. Dickson as a witness for the Hartmanns. The Joint Statement of Evidence was dated March 3 and only listed Dr. Dickson as a witness for Financial Indemnity. The Hartmanns offered no reasonable excuse for their failure to list Dr. Dickson; thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.

The trial court also explicitly noted the prejudice to Gorfkle that would result from allowing Dr. Dickson to testify, stating that Gorfkle had settled with Financial Indemnity in reliance on Financial Indemnity being the only party that would call Dr. Dickson, and had only learned of the Hartmanns' intentions the day before. This was not an abuse of discretion. Finally, the trial court explicitly considered less severe sanctions. When the trial court ruled that it would exclude Dr. Dickson, the Hartmanns objected to the severity of the penalty and suggested that a better remedy would be a continuance. The trial court responded as follows:

<block_quote>  And just so that it's clear to the parties, I recognize that it is a severe penalty to exclude an expert witness.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  But I think this case is very different from those other cases because it's not a matter of the defendant at the last minute making a determination that a new expert needs to be hired.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Instead, it's a situation where the existence of the expert has been known for months, and the defendant has failed to disclose him as a witness that the particular defendant wished to call.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  And it's clear in this case that part of the reason that the plaintiff settled with the other defendant is in reliance upon the various experts that were being called by the various parties.</block_quote>

This statement demonstrates that the trial court did consider the less severe sanction of a continuance, but rejected it because of the factual dissimilarity between the case at hand and the cases cited by the Hartmanns. The trial court also made clear that it rejected a continuance because that would not rectify the prejudice to Gorfkle. The trial court's statements created a record to support its ruling, and made clear that it considered other sanctions.

The trial court's sanction of excluding Dr. Dickson was not an abuse of discretion, given the facts in Dempere v. Nelson,<cross_reference>76 Wn. App. 403</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>886 P.2d 219</cross_reference> (1994). In Dempere, one party disclosed an additional expert witness 13 days before trial. Dempere,<cross_reference>76 Wn. App. at 405</cross_reference>. The party claimed that she had only located the expert the same day she disclosed him. Dempere,<cross_reference>76 Wn. App. at 405</cross_reference>. The trial court excluded the expert from testifying, and the reviewing court upheld the exclusion, finding no abuse of discretion. Dempere, <cross_reference>76 Wn. App. at 405</cross_reference>. In this case, the identity of the expert was known for some time but the disclosure of the expert was the day of trial. The prejudice to the opposing party was more severe than in Dempere; accordingly, the sanction of exclusion was not overly harsh.

The Hartmanns contend that this court should follow Burnet and hold that the trial court abused its discretion. In that case, during discovery the Burnets revealed that they intended to argue an issue not alleged in their original complaint. Burnet,<cross_reference>131 Wn.2d at 490</cross_reference>. The trial court found that the issue had not been sufficiently pleaded, and that the opposing party had not been given adequate notice. Burnet, <cross_reference>131 Wn.2d at 491</cross_reference>. As a sanction, the trial court ordered that the issue could not be argued and no discovery as to that issue would be allowed. Burnet,<cross_reference>131 Wn.2d at 491</cross_reference>. Burnet held that the trial court abused its discretion due to the severity of the sanction, the significant amount of time remaining before trial, the severity of the Burnets' injury, and the absence of a finding that the Burnets willfully disregarded an order of the trial court. Burnet, <cross_reference>131 Wn.2d at 497-98</cross_reference>.

Burnet is distinguishable. The sanction here was the exclusion of an expert, a less severe sanction than the exclusion of an entire claim in Burnet, but harsher than a continuance. Further, the Hartmanns stated their intent to call Dr. Dickson the day trial started, instead of the significant period of time between the emergence of the new issue and the trial date in Burnet,<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> thus making the burden and prejudice to Gorfkle greater. Finally, although the trial court did not make an express finding of willful violation, as noted above, the Hartmanns did not make the disclosure in interrogatory answers, on the witness list, or on the Joint Statement of Evidence, and had no reasonable excuse for failing to do so. The record supports the conclusion of willful violation. See Burnet,<cross_reference>131 Wn.2d at 497</cross_reference>. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the witness rather than continuing the trial, imposing sanctions and allowing Dr. Dickson to testify.

<center>                   IV. Apportionment Jury Instructions</center>
The Hartmanns contend that the trial court erred in refusing to submit their proposed instructions to the jury. They assert that their proposed instructions and special verdict form correctly stated the law on apportionment of fault, and that there was evidence at trial to support the instructions.

Jury instructions are sufficient if `they allow the parties to argue their theories of the case, do not mislead the jury and, when taken as a whole, properly inform the jury of the law to be applied.' Cox v. Spangler, <cross_reference>141 Wn.2d 431</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>442</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>5 P.3d 1265</cross_reference> (2000) (quoting Hue v. Farmboy Spray Co., <cross_reference>127 Wn.2d 67</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>92</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>896 P.2d 682</cross_reference>
(1995)). We review alleged errors in law in jury instructions de novo. Cox, <cross_reference>141 Wn.2d at 442</cross_reference>. `[A]n erroneous refusal to give a requested instruction is grounds for reversal if, as a result of the missing instruction, a party cannot argue its theory of the case or the instructions, when read as a whole, do not inform the jury of the applicable law.' Savage v. State, <cross_reference>72 Wn. App. 483</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>492</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>864 P.2d 1009</cross_reference> (1994), reversed in part on other grounds,<cross_reference>127 Wn.2d 434</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>899 P.2d 1270</cross_reference> (1995). A trial court need not give a requested instruction that is erroneous in any respect. Vogel v. Alaska S.S. Co., <cross_reference>69 Wn.2d 497</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>503</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>419 P.2d 141</cross_reference> (1966).

The trial court properly refused to give the Hartmanns' proposed instructions because they were erroneous. The instructions asked the jury to determine whether the Hartmanns and the hit-and-run driver breached their duties. One of the instructions told the jury that if it found that `more than one entity was negligent, [it] must determine what percentage of the total negligence is attributable to each entity that proximately caused the injury to the plaintiff.' The special verdict form that accompanied that proposed instruction asked the jury to determine whether each entity was negligent, whether the negligence was a proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff, and what percentage of the 100 percent combined negligence that caused plaintiff's injury was attributable to each defendant.

While these proposed instructions may be correct statements of the law in circumstances where fault is to be apportioned between multiple tortfeasors or between the tortfeasor and the plaintiff, they are erroneous when the tortfeasor has conceded sole fault for an accident and apportionment of fault for that accident is accordingly not at issue. The Hartmanns had conceded that they were solely at fault for the March accident. The sole issues were the damages to Gorfkle and whether the Hartmanns caused those damages. If the Hartmanns were not the cause of those damages, there was no need to apportion them to anyone else.

But even if the proposed instructions had been correct, the court could properly have refused to give them, because the instructions as given allowed the Hartmanns to argue their theory of the case. Thus, the trial court's refusal to give the Hartmanns' proposed instructions was not in error.

The trial court gave the following pertinent instructions:

<block_quote>  The defendants are liable for any injury or damage which was proximately caused by the occurrence. The plaintiff has the burden of proving what injuries or damages to plaintiff were proximately caused by this occurrence and what amount plaintiff should recover.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  The term `proximate cause' means a cause which in a direct sequence produces the injury complained of and without which such injury would not have happened.</block_quote>

There may be more than one proximate cause of an injury.

The special verdict form then asked the jury, `What are the damages to plaintiff proximately caused by the automobile accident that occurred on March 4, 1999?' These instructions allowed the Hartmanns to argue their theory that the second accident caused some of Gorfkle's injuries. The instructions only allowed the jury to award Gorfkle damages proximately caused by the first accident. Although the instructions informed the jury that there could be more than one proximate cause of an accident, the facts in this case do not suggest that Gorfkle had any injuries proximately caused by both accidents. The evidence suggests that the second accident aggravated the injuries from the first accident; thus, damages flowing from the aggravation would not be proximately caused by the first accident. Accordingly, the instructions as given were correct and allowed the Hartmanns to argue that they did not proximately cause all of Gorfkle's injuries.

Affirmed.
