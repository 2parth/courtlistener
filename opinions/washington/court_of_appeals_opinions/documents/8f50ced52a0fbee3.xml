<opinion_text><unpublished>  Phillip Zeigler was convicted of possession of methamphetamine. He contends the court erred by denying his suppression motion, because the officer who stopped him did not have probable cause to arrest him. We affirm Mr. Zeigler's conviction.

<center>                                   FACTS</center>
In June 1999, Detective Calvin Nash of the Tri-City Metro Drug Task Force received a call from a confidential informant, Kenneth Erickson. Mr. Erickson reported that two men had recently arrived at his house in separate cars. A man Mr. Erickson knew as `Scott' drove a white pickup, and the other man, Phillip Zeigler, who Mr. Erickson did not know, drove a gray sedan. Mr. Erickson told the detective that Mr. Zeigler asked if he could borrow Mr. Erickson's scales. He further reported that he saw the two men go inside his garage with what appeared to be about one ounce of methamphetamine.

After the phone call, Detective Nash drove by Mr. Erickson's house and observed the two cars that Mr. Erickson had described. In a subsequent call, Mr. Erickson told the detective that Mr. Zeigler had mentioned he had been pulled over earlier that morning by a Kennewick police officer. Detective Nash located the officer who had stopped the car, and the officer identified Mr. Zeigler as the sole occupant of the car at the time of the stop.

Mr. Erickson spoke with the detective a third time that same morning. In this call, he told Detective Nash that Mr. Zeigler was leaving, and he had approximately one ounce of methamphetamine with him. Detective Nash watched from his car as Mr. Zeigler got into the gray sedan and pulled away from the house.

Subsequently, Detective Nash contacted the officer who initially pulled over Mr. Zeigler. Soon thereafter, that officer again stopped Mr. Zeigler. When Detective Nash arrived, he approached Mr. Zeigler's car. He immediately noticed that sitting in the center console was a narcotics field test, similar to the type used by the police department.

Mr. Zeigler was asked to get out of the car, and he was arrested. Detective Nash searched Mr. Zeigler, and found methamphetamine in Mr. Zeigler's pocket. Mr. Zeigler was charged with possession of a controlled substance, methamphetamine.

Mr. Zeigler moved to suppress the evidence, based on the theory that no probable cause existed for his arrest, and therefore the search was unlawful. At the CrR 3.6 hearing, Detective Nash testified that Mr. Erickson reported that Mr. Zeigler had left the residence with approximately one ounce of methamphetamine in his possession. Mr. Erickson testified, `What I told Detective Nash is I thought Mr. Zeigler had the dope. I wasn't â€” due to the fact I wasn't in the house or in the garage when they left, I wasn't 100 percent positive, but I had pretty much relayed that to him.' Report of Proceedings (RP) at 47. Mr. Erickson also testified that he had seen Mr. Zeigler with what he thought was one ounce of drugs when he first entered the garage.

The court denied the suppression motion. The court found that Detective Nash could have reasonably concluded that Mr. Zeigler left Mr. Erickson's residence with drugs in his possession based on Mr. Erickson's assertion that Mr. Zeigler was headed to his car with one ounce of methamphetamine.

After a trial on stipulated facts, Mr. Zeigler was found guilty of one count of possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to 12 months and one day of confinement. He appeals.

Mr. Zeigler contends that Detective Nash did not have probable cause to arrest him. Probable cause to arrest exists when `the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge and of which he [or she] has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a [person] of reasonable caution in a belief that an offense has been . . . committed.' State v. Knighten, <cross_reference>109 Wn.2d 896</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>899</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>748 P.2d 1118</cross_reference> (1988); see also RCW <cross_reference>10.31.100</cross_reference>; State v. Greene,<cross_reference>97 Wn. App. 473</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>478</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>983 P.2d 1190</cross_reference> (1999); State v. Mance,<cross_reference>82 Wn. App. 539</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>541</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>918 P.2d 527</cross_reference> (1996).

Under article <cross_reference>I</cross_reference>, section <cross_reference>7</cross_reference> of the Washington Constitution, an informant's tip cannot provide probable cause to arrest unless it satisfies the two-prong Aguilar-Spinelli inquiry. State v. Jackson,<cross_reference>102 Wn.2d 432</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>433</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>688 P.2d 136</cross_reference> (1984) (citing Spinelli v. United States, <cross_reference>393 U.S. 410</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>89 S.Ct. 584</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>21 L.Ed.2d 637</cross_reference> (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, <cross_reference>378 U.S. 108</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>84 S.Ct. 1509</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>12 L.Ed.2d 723</cross_reference> (1964)). This test applies even if the police do not have a warrant. State v. Conner,<cross_reference>58 Wn. App. 90</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>98</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>791 P.2d 261</cross_reference> (1990). To satisfy this inquiry, the informant must provide (1) an independent and objective basis for evaluating the informant's basis of knowledge and (2) underlying circumstances supporting the informant's veracity. Jackson,<cross_reference>102 Wn.2d at 435</cross_reference>; Conner, <cross_reference>58 Wn. App. at 98</cross_reference>. These two prongs have an independent status and probable cause arises only when both are satisfied. Jackson, <cross_reference>102 Wn.2d at 437</cross_reference>. In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, we review the trial court's conclusions of law de novo. State v. Mendez, <cross_reference>137 Wn.2d 208</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>214</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>970 P.2d 722</cross_reference> (1999).

To satisfy the first prong, there must be factual details from which police officers could conclude that the informant's tip was based upon personal knowledge. State v. Sieler, <cross_reference>95 Wn.2d 43</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>48</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>621 P.2d 1272</cross_reference>
(1980). In other words, the basis of knowledge prong is satisfied when the informant declares that he or she personally has seen the facts asserted and is passing on first-hand information. Jackson,<cross_reference>102 Wn.2d at 437</cross_reference>.

This is the prong that Mr. Zeigler challenges. He contends that Mr. Erickson did not personally observe him leave the scene with the drugs and, therefore, the police lacked probable cause to stop him. The State, on the other hand, argues that Detective Nash sufficiently corroborated the information provided by Mr. Erickson and, therefore, probable cause existed for the stop.

The State relies upon State v. McGee, <cross_reference>15 Wn. App. 563</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>550 P.2d 552</cross_reference>
(1976), where a reliable informant gave police a tip that an individual would be driving a particular car from Spokane to Pullman on a particular date at a particular time, and the individual would be carrying a large amount of drugs. The court found that no evidence in the record established that the tip was more than belief or suspicion. `However, a tip may be the initial impetus giving rise to subsequent corroborative observations by police to support the existence of probable cause which could not be found on the tip alone.' Id. at 565.

In that case, the corroborative evidence consisted of observation of the driver as identified by the informant, as well as the exact vehicle, on the date and time predicted, that was traveling in the direction the tip indicated it would. The court found that based on these observations, the police `could reasonably infer that the information from the informant was gained in a reliable way.' Id.

This case presents even stronger evidence than that in McGee. In this case, the informant was on the telephone, speaking with the detective while the individuals were at his house. He unequivocally informed the detective that he saw what appeared to be one ounce of methamphetamine. He also told the detective that Mr. Zeigler was leaving with the drugs. Later, Mr. Erickson equivocated on the stand, saying he was not certain Mr. Zeigler had the drugs. However, he admitted that when he spoke to the detective, he informed the detective that Mr. Zeigler had the drugs. Based on this assertion, Detective Nash had reason to believe that a crime had been committed. The trial court did not err by finding that Detective Nash had probable cause to stop Mr. Zeigler.

Affirm.

The majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW <cross_reference>2.06.040</cross_reference>.
