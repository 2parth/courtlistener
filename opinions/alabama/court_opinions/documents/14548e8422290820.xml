</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The Alabama Supreme Court in <italic>Lane v. State</italic>, [Ms. 1091117, September 24, 2010] <cross_reference>66 So.3d 824</cross_reference> (Ala. 2010), reversed this Court's decision in <italic>Lane v. State</italic>, [Ms. CR-07-1354, December 18, 2009] <cross_reference>66 So.3d 812</cross_reference>
(Ala.Crim.App. 2009), and adopted the views expressed in the dissenting opinions authored by Judge Windom and Judge Main. The Court held that Lane's 120-year sentence was within the statutory range set out in § <cross_reference>13A-5-9</cross_reference>(b)(3), Ala. Code 1975, and that Lane, a third-time felony offender, was correctly sentenced for a Class A felony to a term in excess of 99 years. The Supreme Court remanded the case to this Court and directed that we address Lane's claim that his 120-year<page_number>Page 831</page_number>
sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the<cross_reference>Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution</cross_reference>.

"The <cross_reference>Eighth Amendment</cross_reference> . . . contains a `narrow proportionality principle' that `applies to noncapital sentences.'" <italic>Ewing</italic><italic>v. California</italic>, <cross_reference>538 U.S. 11</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>17</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>123 S.Ct. 1179</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>155 L.Ed.2d 108</cross_reference> (2003), quoting <italic>Harmelin v. Michigan</italic>,<cross_reference>501 U.S. 957</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>996-97</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>111 S.Ct. 2680</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>115 L.Ed.2d 836</cross_reference> (1991). We recognized this limited principle in <italic>Wilson v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>830 So.2d 765</cross_reference> (Ala.Crim. App. 2001).

In <italic>Wilson</italic>, a majority of this Court held that a first-time offender's sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for selling a substance containing morphine constituted cruel and unusual punishment. We noted that in order to conduct a full-scale <italic>Solem v. Helm</italic>,<cross_reference>463 U.S. 277</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>103 S.Ct. 3001</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>77 L.Ed.2d 637</cross_reference> (1983), analysis we must first determine whether the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced.

<block_quote>  "Application of <italic>Harmelin [v. Michigan</italic>,  <cross_reference>501 U.S. 957</cross_reference> (1991),] mandates that we make a threshold determination in this case by considering whether the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole imposed in Wilson's case is grossly disproportionate to her crime. To perform this analysis, we must consider the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the punishment. <italic>Solem [v. Helm</italic>,]  <cross_reference>463 U.S. [277</cross_reference>] at <cross_reference>290-91</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>103 S.Ct. 3001</cross_reference> [(1983)]. The United States Supreme Court noted in <italic>Solem</italic> that no single factor determines when a sentence is grossly disproportionate, and it offered a nonexhaustive list of factors to be considered when a court is assessing the severity of a crime. <italic>These factors include</italic> <italic>consideration of the circumstances of the crime, the</italic> <italic>harm caused to the victim or to society, the</italic> <italic>culpability of the offender, and the offender's motive</italic> <italic>in committing the crime. Id.</italic> at 290-94,  <cross_reference>103 S.Ct. 3001</cross_reference>."</block_quote>

<cross_reference>830 So.2d at 778</cross_reference> (emphasis added). <italic>See Smallwood v.</italic><italic>Johnson</italic>, <cross_reference>73 F.3d 1343</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1347-48</cross_reference> (5th Cir. 1996) ("In light of <italic>Harmelin [v. Michigan</italic>, <cross_reference>501 U.S. 957</cross_reference> (1991)], it appears that <italic>Solem</italic> is to apply only when a threshold comparison of the crime committed to the sentence imposed leads to an inference of `gross disproportionality.'")

Clearly, Lane's sentence does not meet this threshold inquiry — it is not grossly disproportionate to the crime for which Lane was sentenced — murder. Lane was convicted and sentenced under the Habitual Felony Offender Act to 120 years' imprisonment for intentionally murdering Christopher Toson by shooting him in the chest. "Severe, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation's history." <italic>Harmelin v. Michigan</italic>, <cross_reference>501 U.S. 957</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>994-95</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>111 S.Ct. 2680</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>115 L.Ed.2d 836</cross_reference> (1991).

<italic>Ware v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>949 So.2d 169</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>183</cross_reference>
(Ala. Crim.App. 2006). Lane's 120-year sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment; therefore, Lane is due no relief on this claim.

AFFIRMED.
