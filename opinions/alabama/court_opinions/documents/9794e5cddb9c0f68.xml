</posture>
<opinion_byline>  BRICKEN, P. J.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The charge by indictment against this appellant, defendant below, was forgery in the second degree. He was convicted as charged, and from the judgment of conviction this appeal was taken. There is no bill of exceptions; the appeal here is upon the record proper. The record is without error apparent thereon; therefore the judgment of conviction in the circuit court will stand affirmed.

Affirmed.
