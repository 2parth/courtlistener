<posture>  Petition by the State of Alabama, on the relations of W.T. Seibels as solicitor, directed to Hon. J.J. Curtis as judge of the circuit court of Walker county, prohibiting him from hearing and determining a habeas corpus proceeding instituted by C.R. Walker. Petition for prohibition dismissed.

A warrant was issued out of the court of common pleas of Montgomery county, directing the arrest of C.R. Walker, on a charge of criminal libel, growing out of the publication, in Walker's paper in Walker county, commenting on the behavior of Mrs. O.C. Maner, on the occasion of the visit of the congressional delegation to the Gorgas plant under lease to the Alabama Power Company. Upon the execution of the warrant, Walker brought habeas corpus before Judge J.J. Curtis in the Walker circuit court, who entered an order fixing bail and setting the case down for hearing at a later date. Pending the hearing of the habeas corpus proceeding, this petition was filed to prevent the judge from considering the petition for habeas corpus on its merits.
