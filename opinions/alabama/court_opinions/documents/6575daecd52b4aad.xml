<opinion_text>  What purports to be a bill of exceptions is copied in the transcript, but it does not seem to have been presented, or signed by the presiding judge. In the absence of indorsements by the presiding judge, there is no bill of exceptions; and in the absence of a bill of exceptions, we cannot review the charges refused to defendant.

We find no error in the record and the judgment is affirmed.
