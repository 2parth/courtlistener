<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On September 29, 2003, relator, David Young, filed a second petition for writ of mandamus in connection with a pending post-conviction petition for writ of habeas corpus in trial court cause number 865193. As in the first petition, respondent is the Honorable Debbie Mantooth Stricklin, Judge of the 180th District Court of Harris County.

Jurisdiction in post-conviction habeas corpus matters rests exclusively with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, as we stated in our opinion denying relator's first petition. See In re David Y. Young, 01-03-00110-CV, slip op. at 2 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] Feb. 13, 2003, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.).

The petition for writ of mandamus is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

It is so ORDERED.
