<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  On April 28, 2005, we ordered appellant to respond on or before May 27, 2005, and show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for failure to file a certification of his right to appeal under Tex.R.App.P. 25.2(d). Appellant did not respond. The record does not contain a certification that shows the defendant has the right of appeal; to the contrary, the trial court certification in the record states "this criminal case is a plea-bargain case, and the defendant has NO right of appeal." The clerk's record contains a written plea bargain, and the punishment assessed did not exceed the punishment recommended by the prosecutor and agreed to by the defendant; therefore, the clerk's record supports the trial court's certification that defendant has no right of appeal. <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 25.2(a)(2). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 25.2(d); 37.1; <italic>see also Daniels v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>110 S.W.3d 174</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>175-76</cross_reference>
