TEX. R. APP. P. 42.1(a)(1). It states that Appellant and Appellee have entered into a settlement agreement and that Appellee does not oppose dismissal of this appeal. Dismissal of this appeal would not prevent a party from seeking relief to which it would otherwise be entitled. The motion is granted, and the appeal is dismissed.
