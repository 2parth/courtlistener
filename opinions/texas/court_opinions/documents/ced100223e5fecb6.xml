<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  By notice dated January 28, 2004, the Court informed appellants that the clerk's record had not been filed because the appellants had failed to pay or make payment arrangements for the clerk's record. <italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 37.3(b). Appellants were instructed to provide written verification of their payment or payment arrangements for the clerk's record within ten days and were informed that failure to respond could result in the dismissal of this appeal for want of prosecution. Appellants did not provide proof of payment arrangements and the clerk's record was not filed.

In a letter dated February 19, 2004, appellants were again informed that the Dallas District Clerk was holding the clerk's record awaiting payment of the $121 clerk's fee. Appellants were instructed to provide written verification, within ten (10) days, that the payment or payment arrangements have been made for the clerk's record or the appeal would be dismissed for want of prosecution without further notice. <italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 42.3(b). Appellants have failed to respond with proof of payment or payment arrangements for the clerk's fee.

Accordingly, on the Court's own motion, this appeal is DISMISSED for want of prosecution. <italic>See</italic> 37.3(b), 42.3(b),(c).
