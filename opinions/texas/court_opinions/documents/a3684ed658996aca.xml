<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On April 3, 2006, David Wells and Allegheny Casualty Company filed their notice of appeal. Two days later, we notified appellants that the $125 filing fee was due and gave them ten days to pay the fee. When appellants did not pay the fee by May 3, 2006, we notified appellants again that the $125 filing fee was due and instructed them to pay the fee on or before May 15, 2006. We cautioned appellants that if they did not comply with the Court's instructions, the appeal would be dismissed.

On May 8, 2006, we notified appellants that the time for filing their brief had expired. We cautioned appellants that if they did not file the brief or extension motion within ten days, the appeal would be dismissed. As of this date, appellants have not paid the filing fee, filed the brief or an extension motion, or otherwise communicated with this Court regarding this appeal. Accordingly, on the Court's own motion, we <bold>DISMISS</bold> the appeal. <italic>See</italic> Appendix to the Tex.R.App.P. B(1)(a); Tex.R.App.P. 5, 32.1, 38.8(a)(1), 42.3.
