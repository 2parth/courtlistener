<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  In letters dated May 5, 2005, we informed appellant he had not yet paid his $125 filing fee or filed his docketing statement with the Court. We instructed appellant to do so within ten days of the date of the letters and cautioned him that his appeal would be dismissed if he did not comply with our letters. To date, appellant has not responded.

On the Court's own motion, we dismiss this case for want of prosecution. <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 42.3(b).
