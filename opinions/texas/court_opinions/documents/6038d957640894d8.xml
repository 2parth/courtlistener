<opinion_text><unpublished>  Anthony Ray Faulk was convicted and sentenced on an indictment for possession of a controlled substance. Faulk filed a notice of appeal on December 6, 2006. The trial court entered a certification of the defendant's right to appeal in which the court certified that this is a plea â€” bargain case and the defendant has no right of appeal.<italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(a)(2). The trial court's certification has been provided to the Court of Appeals by the district clerk.

On January 4, 2007, we notified the parties that the appeal would be dismissed unless an amended certification was filed within thirty days of the date of the notice and made a part of the appellate record.<italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 37.1. The record has not been supplemented with an amended certification. Because a certification that shows the defendant has the right of appeal has not been made part of the record, the appeal must be dismissed. <italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(d). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.

APPEAL DISMISSED.
