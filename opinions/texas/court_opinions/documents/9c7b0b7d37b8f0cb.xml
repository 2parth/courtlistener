<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Pursuant to the provisions of Article <cross_reference>11.07</cross_reference> of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the clerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for writ of habeas corpus. <italic>Ex parte</italic><italic>Young</italic>, <cross_reference>418 S.W.2d 824</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>826</cross_reference> (Tex. Crim. App. 1967). Applicant was convicted of one count of aggravated sexual assault and one count of indecency with a child and sentenced to thirty-six and twenty years' imprisonment respectively. Applicant's direct appeal was dismissed at Applicant's request. <italic>Edwards v. State</italic>, No. 02-09-301-CR (Tex. App.-Ft. Worth, September 18, 2009).

Applicant contends that his counsel coerced him into dismissing his direct appeal.

Applicant has alleged facts that, if true, might entitle him to relief. <italic>Strickland v. Washington</italic>, <cross_reference>466 U.S. 608</cross_reference> (1984); <italic>Ex</italic><italic>parte Lemke</italic>, 13 S.W.3d 791,795-96 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). In these circumstances, additional facts are needed. As we held in<italic>Ex parte Rodriguez</italic>, <cross_reference>334 S.W.2d 294</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>294</cross_reference> (Tex. Crim. App. 1960), the trial court is the appropriate forum for findings of fact. The trial court shall obtain a response from counsel regarding Applicant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. The trial court may use any means set out in TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. <cross_reference>11.07</cross_reference>, ยง 3(d).

If the trial court elects to hold a hearing, it shall determine whether Applicant is indigent. If Applicant is indigent and wishes to be represented by counsel, the trial court shall appoint an attorney to represent Applicant at the hearing. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. <cross_reference>26.04</cross_reference>.

The trial court shall make findings of fact as to whether Applicant was denied his right to a meaningful appeal because Applicant's counsel coerced him into dismissing his direct appeal. The trial court shall also make any other findings of fact and conclusions of law that it deems relevant and appropriate to the disposition of Applicant's claim for habeas corpus relief.

This application will be held in abeyance until the trial court has resolved the fact issues. The issues shall be resolved within 90 days of this order. If any continuances are granted, a copy of the order granting the continuance shall be sent to this Court. A supplemental transcript containing all affidavits and interrogatories or the transcription of the court reporter's notes from any hearing or deposition, along with the trial court's supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall be returned to this Court within 120 days of the date of this order. Any extensions of time shall be obtained from this Court.
