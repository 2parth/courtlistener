<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This appeal is from a judgment signed September 20, 2005. The clerk's record was due January 18, 2006, but was not filed timely. The clerk responsible for preparing the record in this appeal informed the court appellants did not make arrangements to pay for the record. After notice and an opportunity to cure, this court dismissed the appeal. Appellants filed a motion for rehearing reasonably explaining the delay in payment for the record. The clerk's record was filed on April 6, 2006. Accordingly, we granted appellants' motion for rehearing, withdrew our opinion and judgment, and reinstated the appeal. Appellants' brief was due May 22, 2006, but was not filed.

On June 8, 2006, this court issued an order stating that unless appellants submitted their brief, together with a motion reasonably explaining why the brief was late, on or before July 10, 2006, the court would dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. <italic>See</italic> TEX. R. APP. P. 42.3(b). Appellants filed no response.

Accordingly, the appeal is ordered dismissed.
