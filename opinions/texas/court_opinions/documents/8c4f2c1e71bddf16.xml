<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Appellant entered a guilty plea to robbery. In accordance with the terms of a plea bargain agreement with the State, the trial court sentenced appellant on October 27, 2009, to confinement for eight years in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal. We dismiss the appeal.

The trial court entered a certification of the defendant's right to appeal in which the court certified that this is a plea bargain case, and the defendant has no right of appeal. <italic>See</italic>
Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(a)(2). The trial court's certification is included in the record on appeal. <italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(d). The record supports the trial court's certification. <italic>See Dears v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>154 S.W.3d 610</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>615</cross_reference> (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).

Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.
