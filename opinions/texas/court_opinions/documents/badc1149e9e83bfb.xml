<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Appellant, Peter John Schuster, pleaded guilty to three separate felony offense of possession of child pornography without an agreed recommendation as to punishment with the State, and the trial court assessed punishment at confinement for two years in each case. We affirm.

Appellant's court-appointed counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a brief concluding that the appeal in each case is without merit. Counsel's brief meets the requirements of <italic>Anders</italic><italic>v. California</italic>, <cross_reference>386 U.S. 738</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>744</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>87 S. Ct. 1396</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1400</cross_reference> (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record that demonstrates the lack of arguable grounds of error. <italic>See High v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>573 S.W.2d 807</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>811</cross_reference> (Tex.Crim.App. 1978); <italic>Moore v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>845 S.W.2d 352</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>353</cross_reference> (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, pet. ref'd).

Counsel represents that he served a copy of the brief on appellant. Counsel also advised appellant of his right to examine the appellate records and file a <italic>pro se</italic> brief. <italic>See Stafford v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>813 S.W.2d 503</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>510</cross_reference> (Tex.Crim.App. 1991). More than 30 days have passed, and appellant has not filed a <italic>pro se</italic> brief. We have carefully reviewed the record and counsel's brief. We find no reversible error in the record, and agree that the appeal is without merit. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court in each case.

We grant counsel's motion to withdraw.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> <italic>See Stephens</italic><italic>v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>35 S.W.3d 770</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>771</cross_reference> (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.).

Any pending motions are denied as moot.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Counsel has a duty to inform appellant of the result of his appeal and also to inform him that he may, on his own, pursue discretionary review in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. <italic>See</italic><italic>Ex parte Wilson</italic>, <cross_reference>956 S.W.2d 25</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>27</cross_reference> (Tex.Crim.App. 1997).</footnote_body>
