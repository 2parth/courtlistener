Hall received a life sentence for aggravated sexual assault. The Court of Appeals held that during the closing argument of the punishment phase, the State improperly commented on Hall's failure to testify.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>
As a result, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded this case to the trial court for a new punishment hearing.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

We granted the State's petition for discretionary review to address whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding that there was a comment on Hall's failure to testify.  We have determined that our decision to grant review was improvident.  Therefore, the petition is dismissed.
