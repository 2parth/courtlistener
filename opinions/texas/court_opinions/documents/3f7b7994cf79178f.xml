<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This is an appeal from a final judgment in a garnishment proceeding signed February 11, 2003. Appellant, an intervenor, filed an untimely request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.Civ.P. 296. The notice of appeal was therefore due thirty days after judgment,<italic>i.e.</italic> on March 13, 2003. <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 26.1. Appellant did not file her notice of appeal until March 26, 2003, a date within 15 days of the due date for the notice of appeal. <italic>See Verburgt v. Dorner,</italic> <cross_reference>959 S.W.2d 615</cross_reference>, 617 (Tex. 1997). Appellant did not file a motion to extend time to file the notice of appeal, however.

On April 30, 2003, appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.  Tex.R.App.P. 42.3(a).  On May 8, 2003, we ordered appellant to file a proper motion to extend time to file the notice of appeal, demonstrating a reasonable explanation for the late filing, on or before May 19, 2003.  <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 26.3;10.5(b); <italic>Miller v. Greenpark</italic><italic>Surgery Ctr. Assocs., Ltd.</italic>, <cross_reference>974 S.W.2d 805</cross_reference>, 808 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no pet.).  Appellant did not file a motion as ordered or otherwise respond to appellee's motion to dismiss.  We, therefore, grant appellee's motion and dismiss the appeal. <italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 42.3.
