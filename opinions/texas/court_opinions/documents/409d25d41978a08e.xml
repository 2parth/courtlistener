<opinion_text>  Relators, Diana Alcala, individually and as Independent Administratrix of the Estate of Alyssa Renee Rodriguez, and Richard Rodriguez, filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the above cause on September 13, 2006. On October 23, 2006, the real parties-in-interest filed a response to the petition. The Court, having examined and fully considered the petition for writ of mandamus, the response, and supporting documents, is of the opinion that relators have not shown themselves entitled to the relief sought. Accordingly, the petition for writ of mandamus is DENIED. <italic>See</italic> TEX. R. APP. P. 52.8.
