<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On January 27, 2004, relator filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this Court. <italic>See</italic> Tex. Gov't CODE ANN. ยง 22.221 (Vernon Supp. 2003);<italic>see also</italic> TEX. R. APP. P. 52. Relator seeks to vacate the trial court's order of January 13, 2004, which denied relator's motion to compel discovery of a legal brief. Alpert has failed to provide this Court with the brief that was presented to the trial court <italic>in camera.</italic> As a party seeking mandamus relief, Alpert has the burden of providing this court with a sufficient record to establish his right to relief. <italic>Walker v.</italic><italic>Packer,</italic> <cross_reference>827 S.W.2d 833</cross_reference>, 837 (Tex. 1992). The record does not establish relator's right to relief in this case. Accordingly, we deny relator's petition for writ of mandamus.
