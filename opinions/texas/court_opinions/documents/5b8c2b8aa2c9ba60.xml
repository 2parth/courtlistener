</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Appellant seeks to appeal the trial court's order modifying the conditions of her community supervision. Modification of the terms of community supervision is not appealable at the time of modification. <italic>See</italic><italic>Basaldua v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>558 S.W.2d 2</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>5</cross_reference> (Tex. Crim. App. 1977). On November 5, 2010, we ordered appellant to show cause in writing why this appeal should not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Appellant's attorney has responded, stating that he reluctantly agrees that this court lacks jurisdiction. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
