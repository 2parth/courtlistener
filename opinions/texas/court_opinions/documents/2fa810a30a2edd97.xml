<opinion_text>  Chevron U.S.A., Inc., Texaco, Inc., and Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. (collectively referred to as CUSA), appeal from an order denying a motion to confirm various arbitration awards. Section 171.098(a)(3) of the Texas General Arbitration Act (TGAA) authorizes an appeal from an order confirming or denying confirmation of an arbitral award. TEX.CIV.PRAC.  REM. CODE ANN. ยง <cross_reference>171.098</cross_reference>(a)(3) (Vernon 2005). But the TGAA is inapplicable to the arbitration agreement at issue because it was made on December 10, 1954. TEX.CIV.PRAC.  REM. CODE ANN. ยง <cross_reference>171.002</cross_reference>(a)(5) (TGAA does not apply to arbitration agreements made before January 1, 1966). Because there is no basis for appellate jurisdiction under either the TGAA or the Federal Arbitration Act, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>
