<opinion_text><unpublished>  Appellant, Everett D. Lott, appeals his conviction for assault causing bodily injury. In two points of error, Lott argues the trial court erred by denying his requested instructions to the jury on the law of self-defense and necessity. Because the issues in this appeal involve the application of well-settled principles of law, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in this memorandum opinion under Tex.R.App.P. 47.4.

Self-defense and necessity are justification defenses. S<italic>ee</italic> Tex. Pen. Code Ann. §§ <cross_reference>9.02</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>9.22</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>9.31</cross_reference> (Vernon 1994 
Supp. 2002). With all justification defenses, in order to be entitled to a charge justifying his conduct, the defendant must do two things: (1) essentially admit committing the conduct giving rise to the indictment; and (2) offer evidence as to why the conduct was justified under one or more reasons described in chapter nine of the penal code. <italic>See</italic> Tex. Pen. Code Ann. §§ <cross_reference>9.01</cross_reference>-.63 (Vernon 1994  Supp. 2002); <italic>Young v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>991 S.W.2d 835</cross_reference>, 838-39 (Tex.Crim.App. 1999); <italic>Gilmore v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>44 S.W.3d 92</cross_reference>, 97 (Tex.App.-Beaumont 2001, pet. ref'd); <italic>McGarity v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>5 S.W.3d 223</cross_reference>, 227 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1999, no pet.). The record evidence supports a finding that Lott did not admit committing any offense alleged against him in the information. Consequently, Lott was not entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense or necessity. <italic>See</italic><italic>Young</italic>, 991 S.W.2d at 838-39; <italic>McGarity</italic>, 5 S.W.3d at 227; <italic>Gilmore</italic>, 44 S.W.3d at 97.

The trial court's judgment is affirmed.
