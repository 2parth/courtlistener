<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Appellants, Valiant Insurance Co. and Maryland Casualty Company, have neither established indigence, nor paid nor made arrangements to pay, the clerk's fee for preparing the clerk's record. <italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 20.1 (listing requirements for establishing indigence), 37.3(b) (allowing dismissal of appeal if no clerk's record filed due to appellant's fault). After being notified that this appeal was subject to dismissal, appellants did not adequately respond. <italic>See</italic> Tex. R. App. P. 42.3(c) (allowing involuntary dismissal of case).

We dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution for failure to pay or make arrangements to pay the clerk's fee. We deny all pending motions.
