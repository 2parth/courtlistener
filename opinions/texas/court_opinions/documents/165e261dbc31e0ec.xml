<opinion_byline>  TOM GRAY, Chief Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Charles Harris, appellant, did not pay the original filing fee for his appeal and did not timely file an affidavit of indigence.<italic>See</italic> Tex.R.App.P. 20.1(c)(1). The Clerk of this Court notified Harris by letter that a $125 filing fee was due within 10 days from the date of the letter to prevent dismissal of his appeal.

More than 10 days have passed, and we have received no notice of Harris's compliance with the Clerk's directive.

Harris's appeal is dismissed. <italic>See</italic> TEX. R. APP. P. 42.3(c);<italic>see Gordon v. Gordon</italic>, <cross_reference>167 S.W.3d 61</cross_reference> (Tex.App.-Waco 2005, no pet.).

Absent a specific exemption, the Clerk of the Court must collect filing fees at the time a document is presented for filing. TEX. R. APP. P. 12.1(b); Appendix to Tex.R.App.P., Order Regarding Fees (July 21, 1998). <italic>See also</italic> TEX. R. APP. P. 5; 10TH TEX. APP. (WACO) LOC. R. 6; TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. §§<cross_reference>51.207</cross_reference>(b) and <cross_reference>51.901</cross_reference> (Vernon Supp. 2004-2005). Under these circumstances, we suspend the rule and order the Clerk to write off all unpaid filing fees that are currently owed by Harris in this case. TEX. R. APP. P. 2.
