1. Statement in bill of exceptions that action against national bank was brought under G.L. 2845, for recovery of usury,  <italic>held</italic> to determine character of action and to govern Supreme Court's consideration of it.

2. Recovery of usury paid to a national bank cannot be had under G.L. 2845, since all state laws on subject of interest and usury paid to national banks have been superseded by Rev. St. U.S., §§ 5197, 5198 (12 U.S.C.A., §§ 85, 86).

<opinion_text>  The plaintiff claims that the only question presented by this record is whether a State court has jurisdiction of a claim for usury paid to a national bank; the defendant insists that the only question in the case is whether a recovery of such usury can be had under a state statute. The bill of exceptions sustains the defendant's claim. It says: "This is an action brought under section 2845 of the General Laws of<page_number>Page 121</page_number>
Vermont for the recovery of usury." This statement is binding upon us. It determines the character of the action and governs our consideration of it. <italic>Halloran</italic> v. <italic>New England T.  T. Co.,</italic><cross_reference>95 Vt. 273</cross_reference>, 275, 115 A. 143, 18 A.L.R. 554; <italic>Legier</italic> v. <italic>Deveneau,</italic><cross_reference>98 Vt. 188</cross_reference>, 192, <cross_reference>126 A. 392</cross_reference>.

That the provisions of sections 5197 and 5198 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (12 U.S.C.A., §§ 85, 86) superseded all state laws on the subject of interest and usury paid to national banks is now too well established to require discussion. G.L. 2845 has no application to such cases, and no recovery can be had thereunder. This is all made plain by <italic>Hill</italic> v. <italic>National</italic><italic>Bank of Barre,</italic> <cross_reference>56 Vt. 582</cross_reference>, which lays down the law as it is now generally recognized to be.
