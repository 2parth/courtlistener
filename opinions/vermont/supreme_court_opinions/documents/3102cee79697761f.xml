<posture>  Appeal from District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit.

</posture>
<opinion_text>  The presumption set forth in <cross_reference>23 V.S.A. ยง 1205</cross_reference>(m) does not violate the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution because it is rebuttable, rather than irrebuttable, and because there is a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed. <italic>State v. Pluta,</italic> <cross_reference>157 Vt. 451</cross_reference>, 455, <cross_reference>600 A.2d 291</cross_reference>, 293 (1991).

Defendant's evidence at trial showed only that the presumption was theoretically rebuttable, not that it was rebutted in this case, <italic>id.,</italic> or that it was irrational.

<italic>Affirmed.</italic>
