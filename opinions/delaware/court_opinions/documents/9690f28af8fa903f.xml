<block_quote>   RODNEY HITCHENS, Defendant Below-Appellant, v. STATE OF DELAWARE, Plaintiff Below-Appellee. No. 487, 2002 In the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. Submitted: October 7, 2002 Decided: October 18, 2002</block_quote>

Before <bold>HOLLAND, BERGER</bold>, and <bold>STEELE</bold>, Justices.

Carolyn Berger, Justice

<center>                                  ORDER</center>
This 18th day of October 2002, after careful consideration of the appellant's opening brief and the State's motion to affirm, we find it manifest that the judgment of the Superior Court should be affirmed on the basis of the Superior Court's well-reasoned decision dated August 12, 2002.

The Superior Court did not err in concluding that Hitchens' motion for postconviction relief was procedurally barred by Superior Court Criminal Rules 61(i)(1), 61(i)(2), and 61(i)(4) and that Hitchens had failed to overcome these procedural hurdles.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.
