<opinion_byline>  RANDY J. HOLLAND, Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This 25th day of May 2006, it appears to the Court that, on March 21, 2006, the Clerk issued a notice to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for this Court's lack of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the Justice of the Peace Court. The appellant has failed to respond to the notice to show cause within the required ten-day period; therefore, dismissal of this action is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
