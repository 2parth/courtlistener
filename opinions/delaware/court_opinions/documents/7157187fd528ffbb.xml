<opinion_text>  Mr. Parsons:

I have received your motion for postconviction relief in which you assert that your two felony murder convictions should be vacated pursuant to <italic>Williams v. State</italic>, 818 A.2d (Del. 2002). The holding in<italic>Williams</italic> does not apply to your case because the evidence presented at trial showed that you beat Sam and Esther Sklut to death in order to rob them. That is, you murdered them in furtherance of committing the felony of robbery. <italic>See</italic> DEL. CODE ANN. tit. <cross_reference>11, ยง 636</cross_reference>(a)(2).

Your motion for postconviction relief is <bold><italic>Summarily Dismissed.</italic></bold>

<block_quote>  <bold><italic>It Is So ORDERED.</italic></bold></block_quote><page_number>Page 1</page_number>
