<opinion_text>  Reuben Anderson was elected Sheriff of this County and commissioned October, 1819. He died the [____]<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> February, 1820. Richard Harrington who had been elected with Mr. Anderson but lower in vote at the general election in October, 1819, on his death, was appointed on the day of February, 1820, Sheriff to supply the vacancy, until the then next general election. At the general election held in October, 1820, Richard Harrington and Thomas Fisher were the two highest candidates in vote, Mr. Harrington being the first, and were so returned; and thereupon Mr. Harrington was appointed Sheriff. Richard Harrington died on September 4, 1821. He was taken sick Friday, August 31, and died the next Tuesday morning. The Governor commissioned Thomas Fisher, Sheriff, on Wednesday, September 5, in pursuance of the constitutional provision.
