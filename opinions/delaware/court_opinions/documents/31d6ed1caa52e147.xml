<block_quote>     JACK R. GIBBS, Defendant Below, Appellant, Hearing v. STATE OF DELAWARE, Plaintiff Below, Appellee. No. 673, 2002 In the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. Submitted: December 6, 2002 Decided: January 3, 2003</block_quote>

Before VEASEY, Chief Justice, HOLLAND and STEELE, Justices.

E. Norman Veasey, Chief Justice:

<center>                                  ORDER</center>
This 3rd day of January 2003, it appears to the Court that:

1. On December 6, 2002, Jack R. Gibbs filed a notice of appeal from a hearing held December 3, 2002, by the Board of Parole. Delaware does not provide for appellate review from the decisions of the Board of Parole.<footnote_reference>[fn*]</footnote_reference>

2. In view of the foregoing, the Court concludes, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(c), the notice of appeal on its face manifestly fails to invoke this Court's jurisdiction. The giving of notice of dismissal would serve no meaningful purpose and any response thereto would be of no avail.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, that the within appeal be and hereby is DISMISSED, sua sponte, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(c).
