<opinion_text>  Indictment for neglecting to make, repair, rebuild a bridge over W. Clay Creek in said county.

That [the] Commissioners form a court and act judicially, not executively or ministerially; have a right to exercise their judgment, and will not direct repairs unless in their judgment they should be necessary; also, the Commissioners form a corporate body, and are not indicted in their individual capacity. <cross_reference>2 Del.

Constitution, Art. 6, s. 1; judicial power or courts of record of this state therein mentioned, the Levy Court not among them. Delaware laws [impose] a power and injunction on the Levy Court to take care of such matters as were beneficial to the counties. There is no other power in the county to repair this bridge but the Levy Court. If they do not, it cannot be done. 2 Body Laws 91, 94, the overseers cannot by law repair it. The cases read by defendants' counsel do not apply. They all go to show that judges etc. are not liable for mistakes, not for neglect of duty. 2 Body Laws 287. The legislature does not consider the Levy Court as a Court of Record no more than they do the Recorder, and it might as well be said the Recorder was not liable for neglect. Ld.Raym. 467, a court of record judge etc. must have the power to examine, hear, convict, and punish. Levy Court have no power to compel payment of fines but they must be recovered before a justice. 2 Bl.R. 1141, in some causes, action will lie for exceeding their jurisdiction. Commissioners of bank have some, though a limited, judicial power and were liable if they exceeded it. [1] Dall. 8.

Where a statute commands a matter of public convenience, every disobedience is indictable.

<italic>Miller.</italic> Bro.Abr. 184. Trespass will not lie against a corporation by their individual names, but should be by their corporate name. 12 Mod. 403. The Supreme Court, if an inferior court neglect their duty, may issue their mandamus.

Defendants are charged by their individual names and of whom the Levy Court are formed, and certainly proper. 1 Bl.Comm. 475. Levy Court no corporation. They do not possess the requisites of purchasing lands, etc. The Levy Court shall grant the money, and the Act, [1 Body Laws] 336, says bridges shall be repaired. 8 Mod. 326, if two justices had made an order to remove a poor person (so as to endanger<page_number>Page 88</page_number>
life) they would have been liable to an information for the abuse of their power. "May" in the case of a public officer tantamount to "shall." Skinn. 370. Indictment against inhabitants of a county refusing or omitting to raise a rate. Court refused to quash the indictments. Show. 75. 2 Str. 920. Where a person refuses to conform to an act, he is indictable. 2 Str. 1146. Disobeying of a statute is indictable at common law. Esp.N.P. 668. The court will not grant mandamus where the inferior court has competent jurisdiction.

<italic>Caesar Rodney.</italic> Question for the Court to determine is the charge laid, indictment or not. This being the first attempt to indict the Levy Court is a good reason that it should not now be done. The bridges over Jones and Worries bridge now not passable. Why not then indict Levy Court of Kent? They have charged us with not repairing the bridge in the indictment. The charge should have been for not levying money for that purpose.

<italic>Miller.</italic> From the laws of the state the Levy Court are a court of record.

<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This indictment should be quashed. First, because from a view of and attention to the laws on this subject there does not appear to be an express injunction on the Levy Court to repair bridges over deep waters, but only that they should estimate and levy money for that purpose. And consequently an indictment should not be maintained by construction or implication. The Levy Court is not a court of record. The Act of 1793, if unconstitutional, is not to be taken notice of by this Court, unless it appears on the face of the law it was passed agreeably to the terms of the Constitution.

<italic>Quaere.</italic> Whether indictment might not be sustained at common law (Rodney).
