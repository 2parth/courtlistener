BRIAN TUNNELL, Defendant Below, Appellant, v. STATE OF DELAWARE, Plaintiff Below, Appellee. No. 114, 1999. In the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. Submitted: March 23, 1999. Decided: April 6, 1999.

Appeal from Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County, in Cr. ID No. 9803020560.

Before <bold>VEASEY</bold>, Chief Justice, <bold>WALSH</bold> and <bold>BERGER,</bold> Justices.

<center>                                  <bold><underline>ORDER</underline></bold></center>
This 6th day of April 1999, it appears to the Court that:

1. On March 23, 1999, the appellant, appearing <italic>pro se</italic>, has filed a notice of appeal from the interlocutory order of the Superior Court dated February 19, 1999, denying his <italic>pro se</italic> motion to dismiss counsel. The appellant has also filed a document entitled "Appellants Motion for the [Suspension] of all Cases in the Superior Criminal Court which involve the Appellant Brian Tunnell and [Defense Attorney] Lloyd Schmid, Esquire."

2. Under the Delaware Constitution, only a final judgment may be reviewed by this Court in a <italic>criminal</italic> case. Del. Const. Art.<cross_reference>IV</cross_reference>, ยง <cross_reference>11</cross_reference>(<cross_reference>1</cross_reference>)(b). As a result, this Court has no jurisdiction to review an interlocutory appeal in a criminal case. <italic>Rash v. State</italic>, Del Supr., <cross_reference>318 A.2d 603</cross_reference>, (1974); <italic>State v. Cooley</italic>, Del. Supr.,<cross_reference>430 A.2d 789</cross_reference>, (1981). This well-settled principle of Delaware constitutional law precludes our consideration of Tunnell's appeal.

3. Furthermore, a defendant represented by counsel may not act <italic>pro se</italic>.  Counsel is the only person who is authorized to act on behalf of the defendant. <italic>In the Matter of Haskins</italic>, Del. Supr.,<cross_reference>551 A.2d 65</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>66-67</cross_reference> (1988).

4. The Court concludes pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(c), that the within criminal interlocutory appeal, on its face, manifestly fails to invoke the Court's jurisdiction, and that the giving of notice of said defect would serve no meaningful purpose and that any response would be of no avail.

<center>         NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is</center>
DISMISSED, <italic>sua sponte</italic>, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(c), for lack of jurisdiction.

BY THE COURT:

/s/ E. NORMAN VEASEY

Chief Justice
