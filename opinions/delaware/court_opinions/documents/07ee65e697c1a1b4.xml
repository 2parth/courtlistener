<opinion_byline>  HENRY DUPONT RIDGELY, Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This 23rd day of February 2011, it appears to the Court that, on January 14, 2011, the Clerk issued a notice to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for the appellant's failure to prosecute her appeal by not filing her opening brief and appendix. The appellant has failed to respond to the notice to show cause within the required 10-day period. Therefore, dismissal of this action is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
