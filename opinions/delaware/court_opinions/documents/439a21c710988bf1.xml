WHEREAS, John E. Foster's Petition for Writ of Mandamus having come before the Court and Kevin J. O'Connell, Esquire, having filed an Answer thereto.

WHEREAS, the Honorable Charles H. Toliver IV having filed a Motion to Dismiss which the Court granted by Order dated March 13, 2002.

WHEREAS, the relief that John E. Foster was seeking in his Petition cannot issue from Mr. O'Connell himself, a private attorney admitted before the Delaware bar.

IT IS SO ORDERED this 15th day of March, 2002.
