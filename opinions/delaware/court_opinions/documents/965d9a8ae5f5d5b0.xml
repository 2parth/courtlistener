<opinion_byline>  Carolyn Berger, Justice:

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This 7th day of October 2003, it appears to the Court that the Clerk of the Court issued a notice to the appellant to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed as moot. Appellant's counsel has responded indicating that she does not oppose dismissal of the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the within appeal hereby is DISMISSED.
