David E. Johnson (Claimant) filed the instant appeal of an order dated March 25, 1998 of the Honorable Donna Lee Williams Insurance Commissioner for the State of Delaware (Commissioner, which had adopted a hearing officer's recommendation to deny Claimant's petition for "covered fireman['s]" line-of-duty disability benefits<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> stemming from serious injuries suffered by Claimant while fighting a fire on June 10, 1982. Claimant challenges this order on two bases. First, he argues that the Commissioner erred by employing the three-year statute of limitations applicable to actions "based on a statute" contained in <cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference>. In this connection, he asserts that even if that statute of limitations applies to his claim (filed May 30, 1996), the Commissioner erroneously concluded that his claim for disability benefits accrued "when a reasonable person, in claimant's position, should have recognized the nature, seriousness and probable compensable character of his injuries as qualify ing for . . . chapter 67 benefits."<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The Commissioner determined that such accruate date would have been three years from June 10, 1982, the date on which he was "medically diagnosed as having sustained injuries . . . entitling him to [chapter 67 benefits]."<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Second, Claimant contends that substantial evidence does not support the Commissioner's holding that no causal connection existed between his current medical condition and his June 1982 injuries.

The Commissioner, on the other hand, argues that she correctly concluded that Claimant's May 30, 1996 petition for disability benefits under <italic>18 Del. C.</italic> ch. <cross_reference>67</cross_reference> was subject to a three year statute of limitations since the claim was an "action based on a statute"<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> and that the three year time period therefore began to run on June 10, 1982. The Commissioner also contends that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner's conclusion that there is no causal connection between Claimant's June 10, 1982 injuries and his current complaints.

This Court holds that the Commissioner's conclusions (1) that the three-year statute of limitations contained in<cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference> is applicable to Claimant's petition for chapter 67 line-of-duty disability benefits and (2) that Claimant's claim for line-of-duty disability benefits is time-barred since it was not filed within the three-year statute of limitations should be affirmed since they were not "clearly erroneous." This Court thus finds it unnecessary to reach the issue of whether substantial evidence exists to support the<page_number>Page 1187</page_number>
Commissioner's conclusion that Claimant failed to show a causal relation between his present medical condition and the June 1982 incident.

<center>                                  <bold>FACTS</bold></center>
The facts set forth below are abbreviated in light of this Court's conclusion that it need not reach the issue of whether substantial evidence exists to support the Commissioner's holding on the casual connection issue.

While serving as a volunteer fireman for the Wilmington Manor Volunteer Fire Company on June 10, 1982, Claimant, trapped in a burning building, suffered severe injuries when a building wall fell upon him. Thereafter, he returned to his full-time job with General Motors Assembly Plant ("GM") on September 23, 1982. However, on September 30, 1983, Claimant was terminated by GM for failing to report to work on September 26, 1983. He did obtain subsequent employment with Electrical Rebuilders, Inc., at the end of 1984 or beginning of 1985. He left that position in 1989. He worked in a part-time capacity from 1992 through 1994 but, as the Hearing Officer noted, has remained unemployed since July 1995.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

On May 30, 1996, Claimant filed a petition for line-of-duty disability benefits provided by <cross_reference>18 Del. C. ch. 67</cross_reference> with the Commissioner. A hearing on Claimant's petition was held on October 10, 1996 before a hearing officer. In his written recommendation to the Commissioner, the hearing officer concluded that Claimant's petition was time barred by the three-year statute of limitations contained in <cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference> since it was an "action based on a statute."<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> The hearing officer also concluded that he found no causal connection between his then-present complaints of disability to his June 1982 injuries, such that would sufficiently demonstrate a finding of permanent disability under <cross_reference>18 Del. C. § 6701</cross_reference> (3).<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> In her order dated March 25, 1998, the Commissioner adopted the proposed Order and Recommendations of the hearing officer.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> Claimant then filed the present appeal.

<center>                           <bold>STANDARD OF REVIEW</bold></center>
In an appeal from a board, commissioner, or agency, Delaware courts defer to an agency's interpretation of statutes it is empowered to enforce if such interpretation is not "clearly erroneous."<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> Delaware courts<page_number>Page 1188</page_number>
will review questions of law <italic>de novo.</italic><footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> There are two questions of law at issue in this appeal: (1) whether the Cornmissioner erroneously concluded that Claimant's action filed on May 30, 1996 was one "based on a statute" and that, therefore, the three-year statute of limitations contained in<cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference> applied to Claimant's claim for line-of-duty disability benefits; and (2) whether the Commissioner erroneously concluded that Claimant's petition for such benefits filed on May 30, 1996 was time-barred since his cause of action accured on June 10, 1982.

<center>                               <bold>DISCUSSION</bold></center><heading><italic>I. The Commissioner's Legal Conclusion</italic> <italic>Concerning the Applicability of the</italic> <italic>Three-Year Statute of Limitations Was</italic> <italic>Not "Clearly Erroneous."</italic></heading><heading>  <italic>A. The Parties' Contentions</italic></heading>
The Commissioner concluded that Claimant's claim for line-of-duty disability benefits was an action based on a statute and, therefore, subject to the three-year statute of limitations contained in <cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference>. Claimant argues that the Commissioner's conclusion is in error. He contends that since <cross_reference>18 Del. C. ch. 67</cross_reference> contains no statute of limitations, none applies.<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> Alternatively, Claimant asserts that if the three-year statute of limitations contained in<cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference> does apply, he nevertheless filed a timely petition on May 30, 1996. As support for this assertion, Claimant relies upon a previous decision issued four years ago by another hearing officer, in an unrelated case, who held that a petitioner should not be prejudiced in applying for benefits under Chapter 67 when the existence of the chapter is "little known.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> Claimant asks this Court to apply the concept of<italic>stare decisis,</italic> which he argues requires the Court to reach that same conclusion.

<heading>  <italic>B. Discussion.</italic></heading>
This Court holds that the Commissioner's conclusion that the three-year statute of limitations contained in <cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference>
applies is not "clearly erroneous." First, it was not error for the Commissioner to have relied upon the limitations period contained in <italic>10 Del. C.</italic> § <cross_reference>8106</cross_reference> since eligibility for and receipt of line-of-duty disability benefits are "entirely statutory in origin and operation."<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> Second, it is of no matter, as Claimant contends, that <cross_reference>18 Del. C. ch. 67</cross_reference> itself contains no statute of limitations. The Delaware Supreme Court addressed a similar issue regarding Delaware's no-fault insurance statute which provided for personal injury protection benefits<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference> but which also did not contain its own statute of limitations.<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference> Nevertheless, the Supreme Court concluded that the three-year statute of limitations contained in<cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference> applied to statutory causes of<page_number>Page 1189</page_number>
action for such benefits.<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference> Claimant further asks this Court to apply the concept of <italic>stare decisis,</italic> which he argues requires the Court to reach the same conclusion as did the Hearing Officer in an unrelated case decided in 1994 by a hearing officer who awarded benefits to a "covered fireman."<footnote_reference>[fn17]</footnote_reference> However, this Court is not bound by the decision reached by the Hearing Officer in that case and now declines to follow it.<footnote_reference>[fn18]</footnote_reference>

Having concluded that the three-year statute of limitations applies to this action based upon a statutes the next issue that the Court must resolve is the commencement date of the three-year time period.

<heading><italic>II. The Commissioner Did Not Err in Her</italic> <italic>Determination that Claimant's Cause of</italic> <italic>Action Accrued on June 10, 1982.</italic></heading><heading>  <italic>A. The Parties' Contentions</italic></heading>
Looking to worker's compensation law<footnote_reference>[fn19]</footnote_reference> and its approach to determining the applicability of the statute of limitations, the Commissioner (in adopting the findings of the hearing officer concluded that Claimant's claim for benefits under<cross_reference>18 Del. C. ch. 67</cross_reference> accrued

<block_quote>  when a reasonable person, in claimant's position, should have recognized the nature, seriousness and probable compensable character of his injuries as qualifying him for available disability benefits, including, in particular, line of duty chapter 67 benefits. Applying these legal principles to this case . . . [Claimant's claim is] time-barred because not filed in the three years of his being medically diagnosed as having sustained, from his June 10, 1982 injuries, a disability entitling him to awards, as defined under <cross_reference>18 Del. C. § 6706</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn20]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

The Commissioner thereafter concluded that Claimant's petition for line-of-duty disability benefits was time barred because it was not filed in the three years after June 10, 1982.<footnote_reference>[fn21]</footnote_reference>

Claimant contends that the Commissioner's findings are in error. Claimant asserts that the Commissioner erred when she looked to worker's compensation law for analogous support to determine when Claimant's cause of action accrued, arguing that causes of actions based upon Chapter 67 disability benefits are premised Upon a contract<page_number>Page 1190</page_number>
theory of law<footnote_reference>[fn22]</footnote_reference> and, as such, the statute of limitations on actions based upon <cross_reference>18 Del. C. ch. 67</cross_reference> does not begin to run until the "contract" has been breached. Claimant contends that the instant "contract" was breached the day the Commissioner denied his claim for line-of-duty disability benefits. Hence, as Claimant, implicitly asserts, the three-year statute of limitiations did not begin to run until the Commissioner denied his claim for benefits on March 25, 1998,<footnote_reference>[fn23]</footnote_reference> the date of issuance of her decision adopting the recommendations of the Hearing Officer.

The Commissioner urges this Court to affirm her conclusion that Claimant's claim for benefits accrued "when a reasonable person, in claimant's position, should have recognized the nature, seriousness and probable compensable character of his injuries as qualifying him for . . . chapter 67 benefits."<footnote_reference>[fn24]</footnote_reference> That date, the Commissioner held, was June 10, 1982, the day that Claimant suffered serious injuries from the fire. She argues that, contrary to Claimant's contentions, his claim is statutory, not contractual, in nature. She also contends that public policy frowns upon "tolling concepts . . . [which] must be clearly expressed to countermand <cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 8106</cross_reference> [citations omitted]."<footnote_reference>[fn25]</footnote_reference>, The Commissioner further claims (assuming, without conceding, that contract analysis applies) that the latest that Claimant could have filed his claim for benefits is October 1, 1986, three years after the date of his termination from General Motors resulting from his inability to perform his duties due to his injuries.

<heading>  <italic>B. Discussion.</italic></heading>
The Court concludes that the Commissioner's conclusion that his claim "[is] time-barred because not filed in the three years of his being medically diagnosed as having sustained, from his June 10, 1982 injuries, a disability entitling Claimant to awards . . ."<footnote_reference>[fn26]</footnote_reference> was not "clearly erroneous." This Court is not persuaded by Claimant's argument regarding contracts and the accrual of a cause of action thereon. As stated earlier in this opinion, eligibility for and receipt of Chapter 67 benefits, like personal injury protection benefits available under the Delaware No-Fault Insurance statute,<footnote_reference>[fn27]</footnote_reference> are "entirely statutory in origin and operation."<footnote_reference>[fn28]</footnote_reference> No contract exists between the parties to this litigation.<footnote_reference>[fn29]</footnote_reference> As a result, the Court finds unpersuasive (Claimant's attempts to analogize the statutes and case law involving insurance contracts to Chapter 67 line-of-duty disability benefits.

It was also not "clearly erroneous" for the Commissioner to have looked to the case law derived from interpretations of<cross_reference>19 Del. C. ch. 23</cross_reference> for direction to determine when Claimant's cause of action accrued, especially since <cross_reference>18 Del. C. ch. 67</cross_reference> lacks any case law or statutory interpretation which could have served as a guide to the Commissioner. Consequently, her interpretation of this "doubtful statute [was appropriately] influenced by language of other statutes which<page_number>Page 1191</page_number>
[were] not specifically related, but which appl[ied] to similar persons, things or relationships."<footnote_reference>[fn30]</footnote_reference>

The Connecticut Case of <italic>Link v. City of Shelton</italic><footnote_reference>[fn31]</footnote_reference> supports this conclusion. In that case, the Connecticut Supreme Court found no error in the trial court's grant of plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, based on the courts finding that plaintiff was "entitled to indemnification for `legal fees necessarily incurred' in degending against a prosecution for the crime of breach of the peace."<footnote_reference>[fn32]</footnote_reference> The trial court concluded that "[Section] 53-39a [of the General Statutes] authorizes indemnification of the attorney's fees incurred by the plaintiff in the criminal proceeding."<footnote_reference>[fn33]</footnote_reference> That statutory provision had provided, in pertinent part, that a police officer must be indemnified for "economic loss," including the "payment of any legal fees" for a crime "allegedly committed by such officer in the course of his duty."<footnote_reference>[fn34]</footnote_reference> The Connecticut Supreme Court noted, however, that the statute did not define the phrase "in the course of his duty." Consequently, it concluded that "[b]ecause the statute does not define the phrase, we must look elsewhere for [its] `peculiar and appropriate meaning' . . . ."<footnote_reference>[fn35]</footnote_reference> The Commissioner in the instant case did just that: she properly looked to <cross_reference>19 Del. C. ch. 23</cross_reference> and the case law thereunder for guidance on the accrual issue.

Thus, this Court finds no error in the Commissioner's determination that Claimant's claim for chapter 67 benefits accrued when a reasonable person should have recognized the "seriousness and probable compensation character of his injuries."<footnote_reference>[fn36]</footnote_reference> The Court also concludes that the Commissioner did not err by holding that Claimant's petiion was time barred "because [it was] not field in the three years of his being medically diagnosed as having sustained, from his June 10, 1982 injuries, a disability entitling him to awards, as defined under<cross_reference>18 Del. C. § 6706</cross_reference>."<footnote_reference>[fn37]</footnote_reference>

This Court, having found that Claimant's petition for line-of-duty disability benefits is time-barred, does not find it necessary to reach the merits of the Commissioner's holding that there is no causal connection between Claimant's injuries resulting from the June 1982 accident and his present medical condition.
