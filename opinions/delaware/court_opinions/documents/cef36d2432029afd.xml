</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This 10<superscript>th</superscript> day of July 2006, it appears to the Court that, on January 19, 2006, the Clerk issued a notice to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for appellant's failure to diligently prosecute his appeal by not filing his opening brief and appendix in this matter. Despite numerous attempts to reach him at various addresses, notices were returned unclaimed and appellant has failed to contact the Court and provide an address, as required by Court rule. Having failed to respond to the Court or further prosecute this appeal in any way, dismissal of this action is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
