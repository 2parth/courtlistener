</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This 12th day of September, 2002, upon consideration of the Defendant's Motion for Postconviction Relief pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 61 and the record in this case, it appears that:

On August 28, 2002, Defendant, Jack W. Wolf, filed a Motion for Postconviction Relief pursuant to Superior Court Criminal Rule 61. The Court has determined that Wolf's motion is time-barred under Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(1), as his conviction became final on June 13, 1986. Defendant's motion is also procedurally barred under Rule 61(i)(4), because his grounds for relief have been considered in his direct appeal and in four prior motions for postconviction relief. The Court finds that Wolf's motion fails to satisfy any of the exceptions to the procedural bars set forth above.

Therefore, because the Court finds that it is plain from the Motion for Postconviction Relief and the record in this case that Wolf is not entitled to relief, the motion is hereby SUMMARILY DISMISSED.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
