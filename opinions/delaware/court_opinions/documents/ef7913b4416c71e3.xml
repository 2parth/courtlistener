<block_quote>       JAMES JOINER, Claimant/Appellant Below, Appellant, v. RAYTHEON CONSTRUCTORS, INC., Employer/Appellee Below, Appellee. No. 415, 2001 Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. November 15, 2001</block_quote>

<center>                                  ORDER</center>
This 15th day of November 2001, it appears to the Court that the Clerk issued a notice to show cause on October 24, 2001 why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for the appellant's failure to pursue the appeal diligently by not filing his opening brief and appendix. The appellant has failed to respond to the notice to show cause within the required ten-day period; therefore, dismissal of this action is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
