This 1st day of March 1999, upon consideration of the appellee's motion to dismiss and the appellant's response thereto, it appears to the Court that:

(1) The appellant, Kenneth Reese ("Father"), filed this appeal on January 15, 1999 from a Family Court order dated and docketed on December 9, 1999. The appellee, Debbie Pettitt-Mimikos ("Mother"), filed a motion to dismiss Father's appeal on the ground that it was not filed in a timely manner as required by Supreme Court Rule 6(a)(i) and <cross_reference>10 Del. C. § 1051</cross_reference>(c).

(2) In support of her motion, Mother correctly asserts that a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed within 30 days after entry upon the docket of the final judgment from which the appeal is taken. <italic>See</italic> Supr. Ct. R. 6(a)(i). Accordingly, Mother argues that, in order to have been filed timely, Father was required to serve and file his notice of appeal on or before January 8, 1999. Father, however, did not file his notice of appeal until January 15, 1999, which was a week too late. Mother concludes that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Father's untimely appeal and, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed.

(3) Father has responded to Mother's motion to dismiss. Father contends, without any record support, that the Family Court initially did not send a copy of the correct order and that he did not receive the final order from which this appeal was taken until December 16th or 17th. Father argues that his untimely filing is attributable to court personnel and therefore may be excused. <italic>See</italic><italic>Bey v. State</italic>, Del. Supr., <cross_reference>402 A.2d 362</cross_reference> (1979).

(4) This Court has considered carefully the respective positions of the parties and has concluded that Mother's motion to dismiss must be granted. The appellate jurisdiction of this Court rests wholly upon the perfecting of an appeal within the period of limitations fixed by law. <italic>Riggs v. Riggs</italic>, Del. Supr., <cross_reference>539 A.2d 163</cross_reference>
(1988) (citing <italic>Fisher v. Biggs</italic>, Del. Supr., <cross_reference>284 A.2d 117</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>118</cross_reference>
(1971)). Jurisdictional defects cannot be waived in the absence of unusual circumstances that are not attributable to the appellant or the appellant's counsel. <italic>Eller v. State</italic>, Del. Supr.,<cross_reference>531 A.2d 951</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>953</cross_reference> (1987).

(5) In this case, even assuming that Father did not receive the Family Court's order until December 17, 1998, he still had ample time in which to perfect his notice of appeal by January 8, 1999. Father's untimely filing is not attributable to court-related personnel. <italic>Compare Giordano v. Marta</italic>, Del. Supr., ___ A.2d ___, <cross_reference>1998 WL 760074</cross_reference>, Holland, J. (Oct. 22, 1998). Although it is regrettable, the Court concludes that the within appeal must be dismissed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the within appeal is hereby DISMISSED.
