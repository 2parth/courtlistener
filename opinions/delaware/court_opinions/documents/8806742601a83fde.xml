This 1st day of February 2001, upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we conclude that this matter should be affirmed on the basis of, and for the reasons stated in the Superior Court's decision of December 17, 1999, denying the appellant-defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, or alternatively, for a new trial based on a claim of insufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction of murder in the second degree.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior Court be, and the same hereby is,

AFFIRMED.
