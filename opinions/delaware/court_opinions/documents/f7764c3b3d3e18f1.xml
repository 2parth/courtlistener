ROBIN L. AMAD, Defendant Below, Appellant, v. STATE OF DELAWARE, Plaintiff Below, Appellee. No. 235, 1999 In the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. Submitted: May 30, 2000 Decided: June 12, 2000

Court Below â€” Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Sussex County, Cr.A. Nos. IK98-02-0009-018; IK98-02-0020-0021; IK98-03-0035-0045.

Before HOLLAND, HARTNETT and BERGER, Justices.

This 12<superscript>th</superscript> day of June 2000, the Court having considered this matter on the briefs filed by the parties, has determined that:   to the extent the issues raised on appeal are factual, the record evidence supports the trial judge's factual findings; to the extent the errors alleged on appeal are attributed to an abuse of discretion, the record does not support those assertions; and to the extent that the issues raised on appeal are legal, they are controlled by settled Delaware law, which was properly applied. Therefore, this Court has concluded that the judgments of the Superior Court should be affirmed on the basis of and for the reasons assigned by the Superior Court in its well-reasoned decision dated February 17, 1999.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgments of the Superior Court be, and the same hereby is, AFFIRMED.
