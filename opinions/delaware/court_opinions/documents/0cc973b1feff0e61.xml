<opinion_byline>  MYRON T. STEELE, Chief Justice.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This 6th day of January 2010, it appears to the Court that on December 4, 2009, the Clerk issued a notice to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for the appellant's failure to comply with Supreme Court Rule 42 when taking an appeal from an apparent interlocutory order. The appellant has failed to respond to the notice to show cause within the required ten-day period; therefore, dismissal of this appeal is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b)(2) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
