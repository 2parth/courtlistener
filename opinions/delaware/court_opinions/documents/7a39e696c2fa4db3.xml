<block_quote>        DARRICK PIERCE, Defendant Below, Appellant, v. STATE OF DELAWARE, Plaintiff Below, Appellee. No. 400, 2002 In the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. September 30, 2002</block_quote>

Randy J. Holland, Justice:

<center>                                  ORDER</center>
This 30th day of September 2002, it appears to the Court that, on September 12, 2002, the Clerk issued a notice to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for the appellant's failure to diligently prosecute his appeal by not filing his opening brief and appendix in this matter. The appellant has failed to respond to the notice to show cause within the required ten-day period; therefore, dismissal of this action is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
