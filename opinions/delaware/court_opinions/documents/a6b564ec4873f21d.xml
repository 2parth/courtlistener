This 24th day of August 1999, upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by Autrey J. Locklear and the answer and motion to dismiss filed by the State of Delaware, it appears to the Court that:

(1) In April 1989, Locklear pleaded guilty to ten counts of felony theft. The Superior Court sentenced him to prison and ordered him to pay $697,539.05 in restitution. This Court later determined that the restitution should be modified to reflect a credit for compensation that was paid to Locklear's victims by third parties.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>  Accordingly, by order dated June 11, 1997, the Superior Court directed that $592,151.10 should be credited to the restitution.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

(2) In August 1997, Locklear was released on parole. As a condition of parole, Locklear must continue to make payments toward restitution.

(3) At a Superior Court hearing in June 1998, the Department of Justice and Locklear agreed that Locklear owed $27,640.00 in restitution.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> At the same hearing, it appears that Locklear agreed to pay an additional $30,000 to another individual.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

(4) Locklear's petition for a writ of mandamus complains that the accounting records in the Prothonotary's office and the Department of Corrections do not reflect the $592,151.10 credit that was ordered by the Superior Court in June 1997 and do not reflect other credits and payments that should be applied to the restitution.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>  Locklear requests that this Court issue an order directing the Superior Court "to review the restitutionary proceedings" and to take appropriate action to correct the Prothonotary's and the Department of Corrections' accounting records.

(5) In its answer to Locklear's petition, the Department of Justice acknowledges that "the accounting records maintained by the Prothonotary and the Department of Corrections do not reflect the various adjustment and corrections in the restitution amount." Nonetheless, in its motion to dismiss, the Department of Justice maintains that Locklear "has invoked the wrong procedural measure" to compel the appropriate corrections to the records.

(6) A writ of mandamus is issued to compel a trial court to perform a duty only when the complainant has a clear right to the performance of the duty at the time of the petition, no other adequate remedy is available, and the trial court has failed or refused to perform its duty.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference>  This Court has no authority to issue a writ of mandamus to the Prothonotary or to the Department of Corrections.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

(7) Locklear has not demonstrated that the Superior Court has arbitrarily refused to perform a duty owed to him or that he is without an adequate remedy to address his claim. If, as it appears from the limited record in this Court, the accounting records in the Prothonotary's Office and the Department of Corrections are incorrect, Locklear should commence an action in the Superior Court for the correction of those records. Conversely, because Locklear has not taken such action, Locklear has failed to establish that the Superior Court has done, or has failed to do, any act that might give rise to a mandamus action.

(8) We note, however, that the Prothonotary has recently advised this Court that, according to its revised records, a much lesser sum ($56,780) is presently owed by Locklear.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the State's motion to dismiss is <bold>GRANTED</bold>. Locklear's petition for a writ of mandamus is<bold>DISMISSED</bold>.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> The transcript of the June 1998 hearing reflects the following exchange:

<block_quote>  MR. MEYERS: It's the State's position that Mr. Locklear owes Judith Just . . . the amount of $23,640. . . . And then as to Douglas Smith, it's the State's position that Mr. Locklear owes $4,000 in restitution.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  THE COURT: Do you agree with those figures?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  THE DEFENDANT: I have no objections to those figures.</block_quote>

Hr'g Tr. at 13-14.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> The transcript states as follows:

<block_quote>  THE COURT: You want to pay $30,000?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  THE DEFENDANT: Eventually, I would like to, yes.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  THE COURT: Is it all right with you if I write and say that you've agreed to pay $30,000 additional restitution for the attorneys' fees to Mrs. Lambert?</block_quote>

<block_quote>  THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  THE COURT: So that makes a total of $57,640.</block_quote>

Hr'g Tr. at 17.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> Indeed, it appears from an attachment to Locklear's petition that the Prothonotary's records reflect an unpaid balance of $455,421.02.</footnote_body>
