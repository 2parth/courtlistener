This action arises out of a long-standing dispute principally between two people, and the companies they control. This tale first began when Peter Sahagen attempted to wrest control of a limited liability company, through the effectuation of merger, from David Castiel, the company's founder. Sahagen then sought a declaratory judgment from this court that the merger was valid. In June 2000, the court held a trial which resulted in the merger being rescinded. Castiel and his affiliates filed a counterclaim against Sahagen and Tom Quinn in that action alleging a breach of their duty of loyalty. Sahagen and his affiliates then filed an eleven count cross-counterclaim against Castiel and his affiliates alleging, among other things, that Castiel fraudulently induced Sahagen into investing with Castiel, and that Sahagen and his affiliates have breached several fiduciary duties that were owed directly to Sahagen or to the companies he invested in. The first trial did not resolve the counterclaim or the cross-counterclaim.

Summary judgment must be granted in favor of Castiel and his affiliates on all but one of the cross-counterclaims. Claims for fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation (as well as claims of aiding and abetting those violations) are precluded for two reasons. First, an integration clause in the agreements at issue, combined with the sophistication of the parties and opportunities to conduct due diligence, precludes Sahagen from arguing that non-warranted statements can amount to fraudulent inducement or negligent misrepresentation. Second, the one statement that was warranted in the agreements at issue was true and accurate when it was made. Thus there can be no fraud or negligent misrepresentation.

All but one of Sahagen's claims that Castiel and various of his affiliates breached their fiduciary duties must fail. These fiduciary duty claims are derivative in nature and there has been no demand made on the board of the limited liability company. Further, Sahagen has failed to demonstrate how demand would have been futile.

Finally, summary judgment must be granted, in part, in favor of Castiel and his affiliates on their counterclaim that Sahagen and Quinn breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty. This result is dictated by the "law of the case" doctrine, and it will avoid the need to re-litigate previously litigated issues.

A. <underline>Background</underline>

On January 6, 1999, David Castiel formed Virtual Geosatellite, LLC ("Virtual Geo") pursuant to the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. As originally constituted, the sole member of Virtual Geo was Virtual Geosatellite Holdings, Inc. ("VGHI"). On January 8, 1999, Ellipso, Inc. joined Virtual Geo as a member. Finally, on January 29, 1999, Sahagen Satellite Technology Group, LLC (now known as Sahagen Satellite Technology Global, LLC or "SST Global") was added as a third member.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

Pursuant to Virtual Geo's Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "LLC Agreement"), VGHI received 660 LLC units (representing 63.46% of the total equity in Virtual Geo), SST Global received 260 LLC units (representing 25%), and Ellipso received 120 LLC units (representing 11.54%). SST Global, which is controlled by Peter Sahagen, contributed the only cash received by Virtual Geo — $5 million. VGHI and Ellipso, both of which are controlled by Castiel, contributed certain licensed intellectual property.

Virtual Geo's stated purpose was "to construct, launch and operate a global fixed satellite service system employing nongeostationary satellites in subgeosynchronous elliptical orbits, developing the related [ground] segment and offering the related communication services."<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>
That system, known as "Virtual Geo," was intended to provide technological advantages believed to be unique among its competitors in the broadband satellite market. Nonetheless, Virtual Geo was a high-risk business venture.

Management of Virtual Geo was vested in a Board of Managers. The LLC Agreement established a three-person Board of Managers consisting of Castiel (the Chairman, appointed by VGHI), Sahagen (the Vice Chairman of Finance, appointed by SST Global), and Tom Quinn (the Secretary, appointed by VGHI).

B. <underline>Sahagen's Investment In Ellipso And Virtual Geo</underline>

Sahagen is a "prolific investor" in the technology sector. Sahagen met Castiel through Sahagen's attorney, and after a series of meetings with Castiel and Ellipso's in-house counsel, Sahagen was invited to invest in Virtual Geo and Ellipso. Sahagen then conducted due diligence on Virtual Geo and Ellipso, including hiring a "technical expert" and consulting with his lawyers. Sahagen, through Neel Howard (SST Global's Rule 30(b)(6) representative), had extensive discussions with employees of Ellipso.

Castiel allegedly made several representations to Sahagen during the course of negotiations. Specifically, Castiel allegedly represented that:

<block_quote>  • Ellipso had the antenna technology and capability to employ a worldwide two-way television system;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • Ellipso was in full compliance with the FCC regarding its license, and that no further requirements needed to be met;</block_quote>

• Ellipso's license with the FCC was in full force and effect;

<block_quote>  • Ellipso's license with the FCC was not subject to any limitations, defenses, or contingencies which might subject it to revocation or cancellation;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • one of Castiel's affiliated entities, Mobile Communications Holdings, Inc. ("MCHI"), had entered into a binding contract with Boeing Company for construction of the first two satellite systems that were to be part of Ellipso's system;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • MCHI and Ellipso were in full compliance with the construction progress milestones and certification schedules established by the FCC in issuing the license;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • MCHI had made substantial progress with respect to the deployment of its satellite system and, in connection therewith, MCHI had received a commitment from Boeing to invest $300 million of its own funds in deploying the system;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • SST Global's investment was going to be used only as a bridge until Ellipso and Virtual Geo received a substantial investment from Boeing;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • any funds invested in Virtual GEO would be used for, and devoted exclusively to, the business of Virtual Geo;</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • Sahagen's investments would be used prudently, economically, efficiently, and in a manner designed to best achieve Ellipso's and Virtual Geo's business objectives; and</block_quote>

<block_quote>  • Castiel would hire a number of persons with impeccable credentials in the satellite and communications industries to manage and operate Virtual Geo.</block_quote>

Neel Howard testified, however, that he was aware of an antenna problem at Ellipso prior to Sahagen's investment in Ellipso.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Howard also testified that Castiel had a long history of promising investors that he would bring in new management and then refusing to do so.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> Howard told Sahagen about this prior to Sahagen's investment.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

C. <underline>Ellipso's Financial Condition Deteriorates</underline>

During its existence, Ellipso raised between $75 million and $100 million in investment capital, over $60 million of which had been contributed before the formation of Virtual Geo. By January 1, 1999, Ellipso still had over $15 million in. cash on its balance sheet. By December 31, 1999, however, Ellipso and its subsidiary, MCHI had just over $2 million in cash. As of March 31, 2000, Ellipse's financial condition had further deteriorated and its cash had declined to under $350,000 while its liabilities totaled over $360,000. Moreover, Ellipse was losing employees at a rapid rate during this period.

D. <underline>Castiel Uses Virtual Geo's Cash For Ellipso</underline>

On May 4, 1999, Virtual Geo's Board of Managers approved a cost-sharing arrangement with Ellipso. At that meeting, the Board authorized an agreement whereby Ellipso would "loan" employees to Virtual Geo at the cost of $50,000 per month for six months.

On June 11, 1999, Castiel, acting in his capacity as CEO of both Ellipso and Virtual Geo, executed a cost-sharing Services Agreement between Ellipso and Virtual Geo. The Services Agreement provided for monthly payments from Virtual Geo to Ellipso of $48,748 through December 31, 1999. Essentially, the Services Agreement extended the previously approved cost-sharing arrangement for an additional six months.

On April 19, 2000, Castiel, in his capacity as CEO of Ellipso and Virtual Geo, executed Amendment No. 1 to the Services Agreement. The Amendment was backdated to December 17, 1999. Amendment No. 1 retroactively increased the fees to $100,000 per month for the period January 1 through May 31, 1999. It also retroactively increased to $130,000 per month the fee for the period June 1 through December 31, 1999. Finally, the Amendment increased the fee for the period January 1, 2000 going forward to $156,145 per month. Although the Ellipso Board was presented with, and then approved, a resolution to extend the Services Agreement into 2000, neither the extension to, nor amendment of, the Services Agreement was presented to Virtual Geo's Beard for consideration.

In addition to amending the cost-sharing arrangement on a number of occasions, Castiel also determined the salary allocations for Ellipso's employees. A number of witnesses (all of whom are former or current employees of Ellipso/MCHI), testified that Castiel misallocated the time they actually spent working on Virtual Geo matters.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Further, Castiel may have charged Virtual Geo for Ellipso employees who never worked on Virtual Geo matters.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

E. <underline>Virtual Geo Struggles From Its Inception</underline>

As of December 31, 1999, Virtual Geo's current assets amounted to approximately $3 million, and losses for the year ended December 31, 1999 totaled almost $2.2 million. Four months later, Virtual Geo's current assets had declined by almost $500,000. Losses for the four months ended April 30, 2000 were approximately $1.5 million. Further, during the four months ended April 30, 2000, the "amounts due Ellipso" purportedly rose from $78,275 to $1,108,230, and "member's capital" fell from $2,969,316 to $1,497,351.

As Virtual Geo was expending cash at a rapid rate, prospects for obtaining additional capital became increasingly dim. Virtual Geo's last draft business plan, dated January 20, 2000, stated that SST Global's initial $5 million investment in the first quarter of 1999 was merely "seed capital." Such "seed capital" was not expected to carry Virtual Geo through the year 2000. The business plan, therefore, called for a pre-licensing round of venture capital financing in the amount of $25 million sometime between the fourth quarter of 1999 and year-end 2000. Virtual Geo was unsuccessful in obtaining this financing.

F. <underline>Castiel Reneges On His Agreement To Secure Professional Management</underline>

Castiel represented on several occasions that he would hire a number of persons with impeccable credentials in the satellite and communications industries to run Virtual Geo.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> In the fall of 1999, Sahagen introduced a highly qualified management team to Virtual Geo. It became known as the "Dream Team" and consisted primarily of Air Force Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan, a former director of the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Alf Andreassen, who was the former director of Bell Labs and President of ATT Global Solutions. Virtual Geo's Board of Managers was optimistic about the prospects of hiring such qualified individuals.

After some negotiations, Castiel and Minihan reached agreement on almost every issue, including Castiel's plan for transitioning management control from Castiel to Minihan's team as it accomplished certain milestones, such as bringing a "major" investor to Virtual Geo. Castiel, however, subsequently began to have second thoughts about giving up control of Virtual Geo's operations. Jill Stern, General Counsel for Ellipso and Virtual Geo, drafted a contract so as not to include the progressive change of control issue that Castiel and Stern knew was a condition precedent to the Minihan team's agreement to join Virtual Geo. Unwilling to join Virtual Geo without such a provision in the contract. Minihan chose not to become part of Virtual Geo's management team.

G. <underline>The FCC Declares Ellipso's License To Be Null And Void</underline>

On or about June 30, 1997, Ellipso, through MHCI. became fully licensed by the FCC to launch and operate a complex satellite system (the "1997 License"). Based on the 1997 License, Ellipso was authorized to launch and operate a 16-satellite "Big LEO" system to provide two-way voice and data communications to customers equipped with mobile earth-station transceivers.

The International Bureau granted the license over objections from several petitioners who argued that MCHI's license application should be denied for failure to show that it had access to funds sufficient to cover the cost of constructing the proposed system and operating it. The International Bureau granted MCHI's request for a waiver of such a requirement, but stressed that the license was conditioned on adherence to a construction progress-milestone schedule requiring that the system be constructed and put into service in a timely manner. The International Bureau stated that it would "carefully monitor [MCHI's] progress toward implementation," and would "not hesitate to cancel the license should it fail without justification to meet the milestone schedule."<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference>

The license order prescribed the following milestone schedule: begin construction of at least two of MCHI's authorized satellites by July 1998; begin construction of the other satellites by July 2000; complete construction of the first two satellites by July 2001; and complete a fully operational system by July 2003. The license order provided that unless the schedule is extended for good cause, "this authorization will become null and void in the event that the licensee fails to meet [this] progress schedule."<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference>

Under the FCC's rules, each Big LEO licensee must file a statement within ten days of a progress milestone date specified in its license, either certifying that it has met the milestone requirement or giving notice that it has failed to meet it. To comply with this requirement, MCHI filed an affidavit on June 22, 1998, stating that it had met its July 1998 milestone by entering into a non-contingent contract with Boeing for construction of two satellites. In an affidavit filed on July 31, 2000, MCHI stated that "MCHI has entered into a binding, noncontingent contract with Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. relating to the construction of the satellites consistent with the milestones and technical specifications set forth in MCHI's [license order]."<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference>

By Memorandum Opinion and Order dated May 31, 2001, the FCC rendered null and void the 1997 License.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> The FCC concluded that Ellipso did not meet the milestone requirement to commence construction of all 16 satellites by the end of July 2000. The FCC found that the Boeing contract was not a noncontingent construction contract because the parties had adopted amendments that essentially nullified the contract. Specifically, on June 30, 1999, MCHI executed a third amendment to the Boeing contract, providing that Boeing could not perform any work thereafter except as subsequently authorized in writing by MCHI.<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference>
The FCC found that MCHI did not issue any work authorizations between then and October 12, 2000. The FCC then determined that between June 30, 1999 and October 12, 2000 Boeing was under no contractual duty to perform satellite construction for MCHI.<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference>

Based in part on these facts, the FCC concluded that MCHI did not meet the milestone requirement to commence construction of all of its proposed satellites by the end of July 2000.<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference> The FCC stated that to meet a milestone deadline for commencement of satellite construction, a licensee relying on others to perform the required work must enter into a binding contract for construction of the satellites that is not subject to material contingencies that remain unresolved as of the deadline.<footnote_reference>[fn16]</footnote_reference>
The FCC found that MCHI was not a party to a non-contingent contract for construction of 16 satellites at the end of July 2000 or at any other times prior to October 12, 2000.<footnote_reference>[fn17]</footnote_reference> In fact, the FCC found that MCHI's "contract with Boeing for construction of two satellites was essentially abrogated on June 30, 1999."<footnote_reference>[fn18]</footnote_reference>

<center>                                  <bold>III.</bold></center>
The original complaint in this action was brought by VGS, Inc. against Castiel, Ellipso, and VGHI seeking a declaratory judgment that a purported merger between VGS, Inc. and Virtual Geo was valid. Ellipso and VGHI then filed a counterclaim against VGS, Inc., Sahagen, Howard, Quinn and SST Global that alleged, among other things, that Sahagen and Quinn breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty.<footnote_reference>[fn19]</footnote_reference>

Ellipso, VGHI and counterclaim-plaintiff-intervener Virtual Geo (together with Castiel and MCHI, the "Castiel Parties") have moved for summary judgment on Count II of their original counterclaim, which seeks a finding that Sahagen and Quinn have breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty.<footnote_reference>[fn20]</footnote_reference>

Peter Sahagen and SST Global (collectively the "Sahagen Parties") then filed a cross-counterclaim against the Castiel Parties to recover their investment and to obtain an award of damages on behalf of Virtual Geo.<footnote_reference>[fn21]</footnote_reference> The Castiel Parties moved for summary judgment in their favor on the cross-counterclaims of the Sahagen Parties.

There are eleven separate cross-counterclaims asserted by the Sahagen Parties. Counts I and X (which essentially replicate each other) allege common law fraud against the Castiel Parties based on statements and omissions made by Castiel, Ellipso, and VGHI. Counts II and XI (which essentially replicate each other) allege negligent misrepresentation against the Castiel Parties based on the same alleged statements and omissions in Counts I and X. Count V is a claim of civil conspiracy against the Castiel Parties based on the same fraud alleged in Counts I and X.

Count III of the Sahagen Parties' cross-counterclaims attempts to allege a direct claim against Castiel for a breach of his fiduciary duties of loyalty and care. This claim is largely based on an assertion of waste and mismanagement. Count IV alleges that the remaining Castiel Parties aided and abetted Castiel's breach of fiduciary duties. Count VIII asserts' a derivative claim by the Sahagen Parties on behalf of Virtual Geo for breaches of fiduciary duties by the Castiel Parties. Count IX alleges a derivative claim by the Sahagen. Parties on behalf of Ellipso against Castiel for breaches of fiduciary duty. The Castiel Parties have not briefed Count IX, yet they still move for summary judgment on that Count. Due to this lack of briefing, however, the court will not grant the Castiel Parties' motion for summary judgment on Count IX.

The final two Counts of the Sahagen Parties' cross-counterclaim are for a "constructive trust" (Count VI) and injunctive relief against the Castiel Parties (Count VII). These "Counts" are remedies, not causes of action, and thus do not provide an independent basis for recovery. Moreover, the Sahagen Parties already attempted to enjoin the Castiel Parties from expending any of Virtual Geo's funds, and this court denied that motion.<footnote_reference>[fn22]</footnote_reference> Thus the court will grant summary judgment in favor of the Castiel Parties on these Counts.

<center>                                   <bold>IV.</bold></center>
Under Delaware law, summary judgment may be granted only where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnote_reference>[fn23]</footnote_reference> When considering a motion for summary judgment, the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that no material question of fact exists,<footnote_reference>[fn24]</footnote_reference> "When a moving party has properly supported its motion, however, the non-moving party must submit admissible evidence sufficient to generate a factual issue for trial or suffer an adverse judgment."<footnote_reference>[fn25]</footnote_reference>

<center>                                   <bold>V.</bold></center>
A. <underline>The Sahagen Parties Are Not Entitled To A Trial On Their Fraud And</underline><underline>Misrepresentation Claims</underline>

In Counts I and X of their cross-counterclaims (which essentially replicate each other), the Sahagen Parties allege that they were fraudulently induced into investing in Virtual Geo and Ellipso based on several representations made by Castiel, Ellipso, and MCHI. Specifically, Castiel purportedly induced Sahagen's investment by: (1) representing that he would hire new management if Sahagen invested in Ellipso and Virtual Geo; (2) representing that there were no problems with Ellipso's antenna technology; (3) misrepresenting the status of Ellipso's FCC license; and (4) misrepresenting his intentions with respect to how he planned to use the money Sahagen invested in Virtual Geo. To establish a claim for fraud, the Sahagen Parties must demonstrate the following: "a material, false representation, an intent to defraud thereby, and reasonable reliance on the representation, causing damage to the plaintiff."<footnote_reference>[fn26]</footnote_reference>

On January 29, 1999, Sahagen, on behalf of SST Global, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Ellipso. That same day, Sahagen, on behalf of SST Global, entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement with Virtual Geo. The Castiel Parties argue that the explicit language of those Agreements prevents the Sahagen Parties from pursuing a fraud in the inducement allegation as a matter of law.<footnote_reference>[fn27]</footnote_reference> For example, as part of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Ellipso made numerous representations and warranties to Sahagen. Moreover, Section 2.14 of that Agreement states:

<block_quote>  [Ellipso] makes and has made no representations or warranties, express or implied, except as set forth in this Agreement. No representation or warranty of [Ellipso] shall be deemed to be made or enlarged as a result of disclosures made or information provided by [Ellipso] to [Sahagen] during the course of [Sahagen's] "due diligence" investigation of [Ellipso] or the Subsidiaries.<footnote_reference>[fn28]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

Finally, Section 10.03 is an integration clause whereby Sahagen agreed that the terms of the written Agreement constituted the sole understandings of the parties. Specifically, the provision states:

<block_quote>  This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule, which is incorporated herein by this reference) and the Related Agreements constitute the sole understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof. Matters disclosed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to any Section of this Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement.<footnote_reference>[fn29]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

Usually under New York law, general provisions such as the ones at issue in this case do not preclude claims for fraud in the inducement.<footnote_reference>[fn30]</footnote_reference> This general law, however, does not apply when (1) the transaction at issue is a multi-million dollar transaction executed following negotiations with sophisticated parties and, (2) the complaining party has the opportunity to discover information that would make reliance on such representations unreasonable.<footnote_reference>[fn31]</footnote_reference>

<block_quote>  1. <underline>The Parties To The Stock Purchase Agreement And</underline> <underline>Unit Purchase Agreement Were Sophisticated Parties</underline> <underline>Engaged In A Multi-Million Dollar Transaction</underline></block_quote>

The general rule articulated by Danann Realty Corp. does not apply to multi-million dollar transactions involving sophisticated parties. In<italic>Emergent Capital</italic>, the plaintiff claimed fraud, following a $2 million stock purchase, with respect to an oral representation about the size of a future stock offering. The plaintiff was a limited liability company, 90% of which was owned by two individuals employed by Wall Street firms and familiar with the securities market.<footnote_reference>[fn32]</footnote_reference> Despite the use of a general integration clause and a representations and warranties clause that did not specifically mention the future offering, the court found that the fraud claim was barred.<footnote_reference>[fn33]</footnote_reference> The court specifically relied on the "sophistication and knowledge of the parties" and noted that the plaintiff's initial investment was "a multi-million dollar transaction executed following negotiations between sophisticated business people. . . ."<footnote_reference>[fn34]</footnote_reference>

The exception to the general <italic>Danann</italic> rule provided in <italic>Emergent Capital</italic>
applies to the transactions at issue in the current dispute. The Stock Purchase and Unit Purchase Agreements were multi-million dollar transactions negotiated at length by sophisticated parties that were represented by counsel. The Stock Purchase Agreement between Ellipso and Sahagen Satellite Technology Group, LLC was for the sale of 20,000 shares of Ellipso common stock for $4.2 million. Similarly, the Unit Purchase Agreement between Virtual Geo and Sahagen Satellite Technology Group, LLC was for the sale of 260 common units of Virtual Geo for $5.2 million. Moreover, Sahagen Satellite Technology Group, LLC warranted its "Sophistication" as an "accredited investor."<footnote_reference>[fn35]</footnote_reference> SST Global's own 30(b)(6) representative has admitted that Sahagen "is a very prolific investor,"<footnote_reference>[fn36]</footnote_reference> and this court has found Sahagen to be "an aggressive and apparently successful venture capitalist."<footnote_reference>[fn37]</footnote_reference> Finally, Sahagen was represented by sophisticated counsel, and also admittedly engaged in extensive due diligence, including the hiring of a "technical expert" and the consultation of Ellipso employees.<footnote_reference>[fn38]</footnote_reference>

<block_quote>  2. <underline>The Sahagen Parties Had An Opportunity To Discover Information That</underline> <underline>Would Make Reliance On The "Fraudulent" Representations Unreasonable</underline></block_quote>

When a complaining party has the opportunity to discover information that would make reliance on the alleged representations unreasonable, that party cannot thereafter take advantage of the <italic>Danann</italic> rule.<footnote_reference>[fn39]</footnote_reference> In<italic>Belin</italic>, when confronted with a disclaimer clause similar to the ones at issue in this litigation, the court held that where a representation about the amount of an insurance policy was allegedly fraudulent, the allegedly fraudulent information did not amount to an actionable claim because the correct information "was readily ascertainable had [plaintiff] asked to see the insurance policy prior to closing on his investment."<footnote_reference>[fn40]</footnote_reference> The current litigation is highly analogous to the facts and issues of <italic>Belin</italic>.

Here, it is undisputed that before entering into the Agreements Sahagen possessed information, or access to information, that demonstrated that the alleged oral representations made by Castiel were false. SST Global's Rule 30(b)(6) witness testified that Sahagen was well aware, before investing in Ellipso or Virtual Geo, that there were problems with the antenna technology and that Castiel would not seek new management, both in direct contradiction to alleged oral representations that underlie the Sahagen Parties' fraud claims.<footnote_reference>[fn41]</footnote_reference>

Additionally, in <italic>Belin</italic>, the court held that the plaintiff could not pursue his fraud claim partly because he warranted that he had an opportunity to verify the representations given and could obtain whatever additional information he required. The court held that, "[h]aving explicitly represented that he had an opportunity to verify the accuracy of information provided to him, Belin cannot now be heard to complain that he relied on information that he declined to verify, although he could have determined the amount of [the insurance policy] simply be asking for a copy of the policy."<footnote_reference>[fn42]</footnote_reference> Similarly, SST Global warranted in both Agreements that it "conducted a reasonable investigation" of Ellipso and Virtual Geo, and had "received such information . . . and ha[d] been given such opportunity to ask such questions of, and receive answers from, representatives of [Ellipso and Virtual Geo], as [SST Global] deems sufficient to make an informed investment decision with respect to the Stock."<footnote_reference>[fn43]</footnote_reference> Therefore, like the plaintiffs in <italic>Belin</italic> and<italic>Emergent Capital</italic>, the Sahagen Parties cannot take advantage of the<italic>Danann</italic> rule and summary judgment must be granted in favor of the Castiel Parties with regard to fraud claims stemming from statements or omissions that were not warranted in the Agreements.<footnote_reference>[fn44]</footnote_reference>

<block_quote>  3. <underline>The Undisputed Facts Show That The Warranties Provided Regarding The</underline> <underline>Status of The FCC License Were Correct When Sahagen Entered Into The</underline> <underline>Stock Purchase Agreement</underline></block_quote>

The Sahagen Parties argue that Castiel made several material misrepresentations regarding the status of Ellipso's FCC license. Specifically, the Sahagen Parties argue that Castiel misrepresented that (1) the license was in full force and effect; (2) that MCHI was in full compliance with the construction and certification schedules established by the FCC; (3) that the license was not subject to any limitations that could subject it to cancellation or revocation; and (4) that Ellipso was in full compliance and no further requirements needed to be meet.

The FCC required that construction begin on at least two satellites by July 1998, and that construction of the remaining satellites begin by July 2000. The FCC also required MCHI to report when those goals were achieved. MCHI entered into a non-contingent contract with Boeing in June 1998 for the construction of two satellites. This contract was subsequently amended in November 1998, February 1999, and June 1999. MCHI reported to the FCC in June 1998 that it was in compliance with the July 1998 milestone.

The crux of the Sahagen Parties' claims that relate to the FCC license is the fact that the FCC revoked Ellipso's license in May 2001. The Sahagen Parties argue the FCC found that MCHI abrogated its contract with Boeing when the November 1998 amendment was executed, resulting in MCHI being out of compliance with the FCC license and subjecting its license to revocation. Since this all occurred before the Sahagen Parties invested in Ellipso, the argument goes, the Castiel Parties breached the specific warranties provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

The facts as plainly found by the FCC, however, do not support the Sahagen Parties' claims. It is true that the FCC found that the November 1998 amendment required Boeing to develop and submit a proposal for a re-negotiated contract and forbade it from performing any other tasks without prior authorization from MCHI.<footnote_reference>[fn45]</footnote_reference> The FCC did not determine, however, that this amendment resulted in an abrogation of MCHI's contract with Boeing. Rather, the FCC determined that <italic>as of June 30,</italic><italic>1999</italic>-approximately six months after the Sahagen Parties invested in Ellipso and Virtual Geo — the Boeing contract was abrogated by amendment.<footnote_reference>[fn46]</footnote_reference>

A plain reading of the FCC order demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact related to Ellipso's warranties of the validity of its FCC license. The undisputed facts actually support the conclusion that MCHI and Ellipso were in compliance with the FCC's milestone and construction schedule at the time Sahagen invested in Ellipso and Virtual Geo.<footnote_reference>[fn47]</footnote_reference> There being no genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment in favor of the Castiel Parties on Counts I and X is appropriate as no misrepresentations regarding the FCC license can be shown.<footnote_reference>[fn48]</footnote_reference>

B. <underline>The Castiel Parties' Fiduciary Duty Claims Are Derivative And There Is</underline><underline>No Evidence That Demand Would Have Been Futile</underline>

<block_quote>  1. <underline>The Sahagen Parties' Direct Claims For Breach of Fiduciary Duty</underline> <underline>(Counts III And IV) Are Actually Derivative Claims</underline></block_quote>

In Count III of their cross-counterclaim, the Sahagen Parties allege a direct claim for breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty against Castiel.<footnote_reference>[fn49]</footnote_reference> This Count alleges as follows:

<block_quote>  Castiel breached his fiduciary duties to SST Global by, among other things, diverting company funds (including SST Global's investments) to his own use, causing the company to pay for expenses which had no relationship to company business, engaging in acts of misfeasance and nonfeasance constituting gross negligence, wasting and depleting the cash and other assets of the company, and misrepresenting or failing to disclose material facts regarding Virtual Geo LLC's business and finances.<footnote_reference>[fn50]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

Essentially, the Sahagen Parties' claim appears to be nothing more than a claim for waste, mismanagement, and self-dealing. Such a claim is clearly derivative in nature and not a direct claim as the Sahagen Parties maintain. In deciding whether a claim is derivative or individual, a court looks to the "nature of the wrong alleged [not] the plaintiff's characterization of the claim in the complaint."<footnote_reference>[fn51]</footnote_reference> To maintain a direct lawsuit, the injury alleged must affect a stockholder alone or affect a particular stockholder right "such as his preemptive rights as a stockholder, rights involving control of the corporation, or a wrong affecting the stockholders and not the corporation."<footnote_reference>[fn52]</footnote_reference> For these reasons. "claims of waste and self-dealing . . . have been held to be derivative and not individual"<footnote_reference>[fn53]</footnote_reference> Thus, it is clear that the "individual" claims the Sahagen Parties assert are more appropriately characterized as derivative claims that are brought on Virtual Geo's behalf.

Responding to the Castiel Parties' arguments that Count III alleges solely derivative claims, the Sahagen Parties attempt in their answering brief to assert new breach of fiduciary duty claims that are more individual in nature.<footnote_reference>[fn54]</footnote_reference> These new claims are permitted, according to the Sahagen Parties, because "[i]n his Counterclaims, Sahagen expressly states that Castiel's breaches include but are not limited to the breaches expressly enumerated therein."<footnote_reference>[fn55]</footnote_reference> In fact, this argument is based solely on the fact that Count III contains the words "among other things" when describing Castiel's alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The court cannot permit a party, upon recognition that its original allegation standing alone cannot survive summary judgment as a direct claim, to assert for the first time in its answering brief new claims based solely on a clause containing the phrase "among other things." Therefore, the court will consider Count III, and the allegations set forth therein, as derivative in nature, requiring proof that demand would have been futile before permitting an individual stockholder to bring such a claim. The same is true for Count VIII, which explicitly alleges against the Castiel Parties a derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duty on behalf of Virtual Geo.

<block_quote>  2. <underline>The Sahagen Parties Have Failed To Establish A Genuine Issue of</underline> <underline>Material Fact As To Whether Demand Would Have Been Futile</underline></block_quote>

The right of a member of a Delaware LLC to bring a derivative claim is governed by 6 Del. C. § 18-1000, which provides:

<block_quote>  A member or an assignee of a limited liability company interest may bring an action in the Court of Chancery in the right of a limited liability company to recover a judgment in its favor if managers or members with authority to do so have refused to bring the action <italic>or</italic> <italic>if an effort to cause those managers or members to</italic> <italic>bring the action is not likely to succeed</italic>.<footnote_reference>[fn56]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

This provision originates from the well-developed body of Delaware law governing derivative suits by stockholders of a corporation. Accordingly, case law governing corporate derivative suits is equally applicable to suits on behalf of an LLC.<footnote_reference>[fn57]</footnote_reference>

The Sahagen Parties concede that no demand was made of Virtual Geo's board.<footnote_reference>[fn58]</footnote_reference> Under Delaware law, an individual plaintiff can only bring a derivative claim against an LLC without first making a demand of the board if such demand would have been futile.<footnote_reference>[fn59]</footnote_reference> A demand is considered futile when a reasonable doubt exists as to whether "(a) the [managers] were disinterested or independent, [or] (b) the challenged transaction was the product of a valid exercise of business judgment."<footnote_reference>[fn60]</footnote_reference> The presence of either situation excuses the lack of a demand.<footnote_reference>[fn61]</footnote_reference>

Both the Castiel Parties and the Sahagen Parties concede that the sole issue relating to whether demand on the Virtual Geo board would have been futile depends on whether Ambassador (Ret.) Gerald Helman would be disinterested and independent in a demand made by Sahagen to pursue litigation against Castiel for breach of fiduciary duty. This is because Castiel and Sahagen are the other two members of Virtual Geo's three-person Board of Managers. To support their argument that Helman was not disinterested or independent, the Sahagen Parties argue that Helman "is entirely dependent upon Castiel because his only other employment is as an officer in Ellipso, which Castiel controls."<footnote_reference>[fn62]</footnote_reference> The Sahagen parties also allege beholdeness on the part of Helman because he and Sahagen are close friends.<footnote_reference>[fn63]</footnote_reference> In the same breath, however, the Sahagen Parties argue that Helman is beholden to Castiel because Helman once before acted to remove Castiel from a position of authority at Ellipso and Castiel terminated Helman. Helman is now allegedly afraid of similar reprisals. These arguments are all insufficient to satisfy the requirement that individual plaintiffs demonstrate futility before bringing a derivative claim on behalf of an LLC.

It may be true that Helman's sole <italic>employment</italic> is as an officer of Ellipso, but this misses the point that Helman has other substantial sources of income. In his sworn affidavit, Helman stated that "I am not dependent on my Ellipso salary. My Ellipso salary is a supplement to my chief source of income. I am retired from a senior position in the Foreign Service of the Department of State and am receiving a full annuity that includes medical and other benefits."<footnote_reference>[fn64]</footnote_reference> The Sahagen Parties' second claim that because they are friends Helman is incapable of initiating a suit against Castiel, is defeated by their third claim that argues Helman has opposed Castiel, to the point that Castiel chose to fire Helman, at times prior to this litigation. Clearly their friendship has not stood in the way of their past business dealings and there is no reason to think that it should in the future. Finally, the Sahagen Parties' third contention does not prove that Helman is beholden to Castiel. If anything, this argument supports an inference that Helman is not beholden to Castiel. The very fact that Helman supposedly was willing to risk his job to vote his conscience, and against Castiel, in the past demonstrates that he is not beholden to Castiel and is willing to vote against him again should the situation call for it.

For all these reasons, the court will grant summary judgment in favor of the Castiel Parties on Counts III, IV, and VIII of the Sahagen Parties' counterclaim for failure to seek demand and an inability to demonstrate that such demand would have been futile.<footnote_reference>[fn65]</footnote_reference>

C. <underline>Summary Judgment Should Be Entered Against Sahagen And Quinn For</underline><underline>Breach of Their Duty of Loyalty</underline>

Count II of the complaint of Virtual Geo and Count II of the Castiel Parties' counterclaims allege that Sahagen and Quinn breached their duty of loyalty when, in the context of a merger, they attempted to wrest control of Virtual Geo from Castiel without his consent. Then-Vice Chancellor Steele, in a trial on a corporate governance issue, has already held that Sahagen and Quinn "owed a duty of loyalty to [Virtual Geo], its investors and Castiel, their fellow manager," and "that the actions of Sahagen and Quinn, in their capacity as managers constituted a breach of their duty of loyalty."<footnote_reference>[fn66]</footnote_reference> This holding, according to the Castiel Parties, is the "law of the case" and, consequently. summary judgment should be entered in favor of the Castiel Parties on Count II of their counterclaims.<footnote_reference>[fn67]</footnote_reference>

The doctrine of "law of the case" is not a hard and fast rule, however.<footnote_reference>[fn68]</footnote_reference> The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that "[t]he law of the case doctrine is not inflexible in that, unlike <italic>res judicata</italic>, it is not an absolute bar to reconsideration of a prior decision that is clearly wrong, produces an injustice, or should be revisited because of changed circumstances."<footnote_reference>[fn69]</footnote_reference> The Sahagen Parties urge this court not to apply the "law of the case" doctrine because to do so would "create an injustice."<footnote_reference>[fn70]</footnote_reference>

The court does find that any such injustice would occur if the "law of the case" doctrine were applied only with respect to whether or not a breach of the duty of loyalty occurred. There have been no changed circumstances since then-Vice Chancellor Steele issued his opinion. It also was not clearly wrong since the Delaware Supreme Court has subsequently affirmed the decision.<footnote_reference>[fn71]</footnote_reference> Thus, the court concludes that the "law of the case" doctrine does apply to the current facts, and Sahagen and Quinn will be held to have breached their duty of loyalty. Otherwise, the Castiel Parties would be forced to call witnesses to testify about what happened with respect to the attempted merger — testimony with which this court is all too familiar. Any such requirement would be redundant and serve to waste this court's time.

The Sahagen Parties argue that even if the "law of the case" is applied to Sahagen's and Quinn's breaches, important issues remain for trial as to questions of cause in fact, proximate cause, damages, setoff, comparative fault, estoppel, unclean hands, and contribution. The Castiel Parties do not disagree.<footnote_reference>[fn72]</footnote_reference> Accordingly, the court will only grant summary judgment on Count II of the Castiel Parties' complaints to the extent that the "law of the case" doctrine instructs this court to find that Sahagen and Quinn breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty.

For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment is granted in favor of the Castiel Parties on the Sahagen Parties' cross-counterclaim, except as to Count IX of that counterclaim. Summary judgment is granted in part in favor of the Castiel Parties on Count II of its counterclaim to the extent that the court finds that Quinn and Sahagen breached their duty of loyalty. The parties shall consult and present a conforming order within 10 days of this opinion.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn15]</footnote_number> The FCC also determined that the contract with Teledyne Brown on which MCHI predicated its second milestone certification did not require Teledyne Brown to build or deliver satellites for MCHI. Although Teledyne Brown is involved in the aerospace industry, it does not manufacture or construct satellites. The FCC determined that the contract only engaged Teledyne Brown to provide consulting and managerial services in three successive phases. Further, the FCC found that the work schedule specified in the contract with Teledyne Brown was merely tentative because MCHI reserved the right to add to, change, or delete the work to be performed by Teledyne Brown and alter the times for performance. The FCC also noted that Teledyne Brown was to consult with MCHI in advance of each calendar quarter as to what work to perform in that period, and MCHI would not be liable for payment for any work performed without such prior approval. <italic>See id</italic>.

The Sahagen Parties also previously filed many of these same claims under a different caption on April 19, 2000 (the "17997 action"). This court has taken the position that the 17997 action has been consolidated with the 17995 action.</footnote_body>
