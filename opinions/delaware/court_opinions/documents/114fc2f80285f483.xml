Court Below: Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Sussex County Cr. ID No. 9809013934

Myron T. Steele, Justice:

<center>                                  ORDER</center>
This 29th day of January 2002, it appears to the Court that:

(1) On January 4, 2002, Ronald E. Proctor, Jr., filed a Notice of Appeal from an Order of Superior Court dated November 2, 2001. A timely Notice of Appeal from a November 2, 2001 Order should have been filed on or before December 3, 2001.

(2) On January 8, 2002, the Clerk issued a notice to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 29(b) for the appellant's failure to file the appeal within 30 days after entry upon the docket of the order from which the appeal is taken, as required by Supreme Court Rule 6.

(3) Mr. Proctor has failed to respond to the notice to show cause within the required ten-day period; therefore, dismissal of this action is deemed to be unopposed.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 3(b) and 29(b), that the within appeal is DISMISSED.
