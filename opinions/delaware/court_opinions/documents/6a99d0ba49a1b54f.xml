<opinion_text>  Dear Mr. Jones:

On May 8, 2009, the Court received your Motion for Postconviction Relief. It is denied.

Following a jury trial in March of 2008, you were convicted of rape in the first degree and attempted rape in the second degree. On May 9, 2008, you were sentenced to a period of twenty-five (25) years incarceration, followed by probation.

Following an appeal, your conviction was affirmed. <italic>Jones v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>963 A.2d 138</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>2008</cross_reference> WL 5160291, at *1 (Del. Dec. 10, 2008) (TABLE).

In your present Motion, you raise one claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The sum total of your allegation is as follows: "My attorney didn't put any time in preparing for my case, contacted witnesses at the last minute and never questioned the victim."

In allegations alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, you must make specific allegations as to what your attorney did wrong, or omitted. Then you must allege how that actually prejudiced you.<italic>Strickland v. Washington</italic>, <cross_reference>466 U.S. 668</cross_reference> (1984). You must make concrete allegations concerning ineffective assistance of your attorney, or risk summary dismissal. <italic>Dawson v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>673 A.2d 1186</cross_reference> (Del. 1996).<page_number>Page 2</page_number>

You have merely stated conclusory allegations and therefore your Motion for Postconviction Relief is denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
