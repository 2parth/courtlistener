</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On July 6, 2006, this Court entered Administrative Order No. 2006-56 establishing a new governance and administrative structure for the Justice of Peace Courts in Maricopa County. The Order returned day-to-day control of the staff of each justice court to the individual justices of the peace and gave justices of the peace greater responsibility and authority for the budgets of their respective courts and management of their caseloads. Additionally, the Order maintained centralized provision of certain shared support services that were determined to be more efficiently and cost effectively provided by the Superior Court.

After two years of governance experience under the current Order, this Court has concluded that revisions to the Order are needed to expand the day-to-day authority and responsibilities exercised by Justices of the Peace over their respective courts and to clarify the authority and management responsibilities exercised by the Presiding Justice of the Peace to administer the Justice Court system in Maricopa County. Additionally, the revisions rename and redefine the duties of the Regional Presiding (now Coordinating) Justices of the Peace and reassign court personnel to provide justice courts with the resources needed to support the administrative functions not otherwise provided by the Superior Court.

The size and complexity of the justice court system of Maricopa County present administrative challenges and opportunities that are unique in the state. Accordingly, an administrative and governance structure that is tailored to best meet the needs of the Justice of Peace Courts in Maricopa County and the expectations of the public it serves is necessary.

Now, therefore, pursuant to Article <cross_reference>VI</cross_reference>, Section <cross_reference>3</cross_reference>, of the Arizona Constitution,

IT IS ORDERED that the provisions of this Order supersede all provisions of Supreme Court Administrative Order No. 2006-56 related to "Establishment of a Governance and Administrative Structure for the Justice of the Peace Courts in Maricopa County," Supreme Court Administrative Order No. 2005-22 related to "Duties of the Presiding Justice of the Peace" and Supreme Court Administrative Order No. 2005-21 related to "Duties of the Justice of the Peace" for Justices of the Peace in Maricopa County. Supreme Court Administrative Orders Nos. 2005-21 and 2005-22 shall remain in effect for all counties in the state other than Maricopa County.<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
