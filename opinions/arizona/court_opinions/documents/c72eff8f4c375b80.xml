<opinion_text>  In this appeal we must decide whether a person who is required to report sexual abuse of a child is immune from civil liability in doing so.

Plaintiff-Appellant, L.A.R., individually and on behalf of his son, J.A.R., and his daughter, J.R., appeal from the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees. Appellants' complaint alleged negligence, the tort of outrage, loss of consortium and entitlement to punitive damages as the result of appellees' actions. Appellant claims that those actions led to criminal child abuse charges against appellant L.A.R. and alleged loss of relationship between L.A.R. and his children, J.A.R. and J.R. The trial court granted appellees partial summary judgment on all of appellant's claims arising from appellees' reports of alleged sexual abuse to appropriate authorities pursuant to A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>, leaving only the claim of loss of consortium based on negligent treatment of the children and the punitive damages claims to be litigated.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Plaintiff-son, J.A.R., age 5 at the time, received counseling at appellee Jane Wayland Center for behavioral problems. Rose Marie Ludwig was his counselor at the center. J.A.R.'s father, L.A.R., also a plaintiff in this case, and mother met with Ludwig regarding their son. Ludwig noticed some conflict between the parents and recommended that they come to see<page_number>Page 26</page_number>
her for marital counseling. The parents agreed and made an appointment which was subsequently canceled. The mother told Ludwig that her husband did not want to go for counseling.

Some weeks later the mother telephoned Ludwig and related an incident in which her three-year-old daughter, J.R., had described being molested by her father. The mother went to Ludwig's office at Ludwig's request. Ludwig told the mother that they had to report the incident to Child Protective Services (CPS) and to the police. The mother and Ludwig both provided information to the CPS caseworker. Ludwig told the caseworker that the child's behavior was consistent with sexual abuse. Ludwig then telephoned the police and related the allegations of sexual abuse.

The only information Ludwig relied on in her reports to CPS and the police was the information given to her by the mother. Ludwig believed that she was required to immediately report the alleged abuse to CPS and to the police and that she had no duty to investigate the allegation before reporting it.

After receiving the report, Officer James Ryan spoke with Ludwig and the mother in Ludwig's office. Ludwig did not tell Officer Ryan, nor the CPS caseworker, that the daughter had told her mother that some of her playmates had touched her private parts. At the officer's request the mother then went home to get the daughter. Subsequently, Ludwig conducted a taped interview with the child, and Officer Ryan and Ludwig next interviewed the child. After these interviews, Officer Ryan told the mother that she must obtain an order of protection to keep her husband from entering the home or the state would take the children away. Ludwig confirmed the officer's statement. Ludwig continued to treat the two children.

About two months later the father was indicted for sexual conduct with a minor and molestation of a child, which are class two felonies. On March 6, 1987, all charges against the father were dismissed with prejudice.

The father and his two minor children then filed their complaint against Ludwig, and her husband, Dr. Paul Bedell; Dr. George Dee, Ludwig's supervisor; and the Jane Wayland Center.

ISSUES AND DISCUSSION

Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting appellees partial summary judgment because the questions of whether Ludwig had reasonable grounds to report sexual abuse and whether she did so without malice are questions for the trier of fact. We disagree with appellants. First, we believe Ludwig was required to report the allegations of sexual abuse of the daughter as related to Ludwig by the mother because she is a counselor, one of the listed professionals in A.R.S. §<cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>(A)<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>, the mandatory reporting statute.<page_number>Page 27</page_number>
Although appellants argue that paragraph A of A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>
does not apply in this situation because Ludwig did not observe or examine the child prior to reporting, we do not read this statute so narrowly. Considering the strong policy reasons for requiring professionals who work with children to report instances of suspected child abuse, we conclude that Ludwig examined the alleged abuse sufficiently to require her to make a report pursuant to A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>(A). Although Ludwig did not observe the minor, she examined the mother in detail about the minor's behavior.

The trial court's finding that appellees were immune from civil liability pursuant to A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>(F)<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> necessarily implies that the court concluded that Ludwig had reasonable grounds to believe that the daughter had been abused. We concur in this finding.

We agree with appellees that "reasonable grounds" as used in A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>(A) and (B) means that if there are any facts from which one could reasonably conclude that a child had been abused, the person knowing those facts is required to report those facts to the appropriate authorities. "Reasonable grounds" is a low standard. While this appeal may present a close case of when reasonable minds may disagree as to whether reasonable grounds to report alleged abuse exists, we believe that the policy of encouraging people to report child abuse mandates the determination that the trial court did not err in finding that Ludwig had reasonable grounds to suspect abuse and therefore to report it.

The statute does not contemplate that a person must fully investigate the suspected abuse before making a report. All the person must do is make the report. It is the responsibility of Child Protective Services and the police to investigate the allegations. That is what happened in this case. Although Ludwig's report prompted the investigation, the investigation was carried out by the police and CPS, and nearly three months passed before the father was charged with a crime. Courts in other states considering similar child abuse reporting statutes have reached the similar conclusion that a pre-report investigation is not required. <italic>See April K. v. Boston Children's Service Assoc.</italic>,<cross_reference>581 F. Supp. 711</cross_reference> (D.C.Mass. 1984); <italic>Gross v. Myers</italic>, <cross_reference>229 Mont. 509</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>748 P.2d 459</cross_reference> (1987); <italic>Brozovich v. Circle C Group Homes,</italic><italic>Inc.</italic>,<page_number>Page 28</page_number><cross_reference>120 Pa. Cmwlth. 417</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>548 A.2d 698</cross_reference> (1988). Likewise, we do not believe our legislature intended persons with knowledge of alleged child abuse to conduct their own investigation to decide whether enough evidence of abuse exists to warrant a report.

If a person had reasonable grounds to make a report under A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>, he or she "shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability by reason of such action unless such person acted with malice . . ." A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>(F). Appellants argue that whether Ludwig reported the alleged abuse due to malice toward the father is a question of fact that precludes summary judgment.

This court recently faced similar issues when we addressed the immunity available to a CPS caseworker performing duties relating to the investigation and filing of child dependency petitions.<italic>Nation v. Colla</italic>, 1 CA-CV 89-501, Ariz. (Filed September 26, App. 1991). <italic>Nation</italic> involved a claim pursuant to <cross_reference>42 U.S.C. § 1983</cross_reference>, and we construed federal law to entitle the caseworker to absolute immunity for actions relating to the initiation and filing of the dependency petition. Slip op. at 16. We further held that the caseworker's actions <italic>prior to</italic> the filing of the dependency petition were entitled to qualified immunity only.<italic>Id.</italic> at 21.

The dissent in <italic>Nation</italic> would have considered federal issues in the case in light of Arizona statutes. The dissent stated:

<block_quote>  The Arizona legislature has spoken on the exact issue facing this court, that is, absolute versus qualified immunity. A.R.S. § 8-546.04(A) provides:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    Any person making a complaint, or providing information or otherwise participating in the program authorized by this article [child protective services] shall be immune from any civil or criminal liability by reason of such action, <italic>unless such</italic> <italic>person acted with malice.</italic> . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (Emphasis added.) This is a classic definition of qualified immunity.</block_quote>

<italic>Id.</italic> at 29. (Jacobson, J., dissenting in part, concurring in part).

For purposes of the present case, we note that the language of A.R.S. § 8-546.04(A) and the immunity language of A.R.S. §<cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>(F) are identical. We agree with the characterization of this language as a "classic definition of qualified immunity."

The immunity in the reporting statute is a qualified immunity because it can be overcome by a showing of malice on the part of the person who reported the alleged abuse. <italic>See Roscoe v.</italic><italic>Schoolitz</italic>, <cross_reference>105 Ariz. 310</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>314</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>464 P.2d 333</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>337</cross_reference> (1970). The presumption is that a person acted in good faith with proper motives. <italic>See id.</italic> Malicious intent must be proved by the plaintiff to defeat the defense of qualified immunity. <italic>Id.</italic>
A.R.S. § <cross_reference>1-215</cross_reference>(15) provides that "malice" and "maliciously" "import a wish to vex, annoy or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established by either proof or a presumption of law."

Appellants presented no evidence that Ludwig's report of the alleged abuse was motivated by any malice toward the father. Even if she knew of marital problems between the parents, this knowledge leads to no conclusion that she would have any motive to injure the father. Likewise, there was no showing that Ludwig bore any ill will toward the father. In light of the complete lack of evidence that Ludwig acted with malice in reporting the alleged abuse, the trial court was correct in finding that appellees were immune from civil liability for Ludwig's report of alleged child abuse.

Finally, appellants argue that summary judgment should not have been granted as to the negligence claims based on improper treatment and counseling of the children and on infliction of emotional distress. Appellants are correct that the immunity statute would not apply to these claims. Appellees' motion for summary judgment sought judgment only on the ground of statutory immunity pursuant to A.R.S. § <cross_reference>13-3620</cross_reference>. It is unclear from the partial summary judgment whether the negligence claims alleging negligent counseling<page_number>Page 29</page_number>
and the claim alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress (outrage) were disposed of in the judgment. The trial court should not have disposed of these claims, because the only ground for judgment was immunity. Thus, to the extent that these claims were dismissed in the partial summary judgment, we reverse the judgment and remand for litigation of these claims. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.
