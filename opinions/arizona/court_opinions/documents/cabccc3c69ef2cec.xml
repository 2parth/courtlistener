<syllabus>CRIMINAL LAW. â€” Where record was filed January 25th and transcript of evidence February 26th and appellant made no appearance beyond filing appeal papers, and Attorney General's motion of May 1st to have case submitted on record was granted, burglary conviction was affirmed on June 16th, after examination of papers on file and evidence disclosed that appellant was accorded fair trial.

<posture>  APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of the County of Maricopa. Henry C. Kelly, Judge. Judgment affirmed.

</posture><attorneys>  Mr. C.H. Young, for Appellant.

Mr. John L. Sullivan, Attorney General, and Mr. W. Francis Wilson, Assistant Attorney General, for the State.

<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The defendant, Claude Smith, was convicted of burglary in the first degree, in the superior court of Maricopa county, and sentenced to not less than five nor more than fifteen years in the penitentiary. He has appealed.

The record was filed here January 25th, and the transcript of the evidence February 26, 1936. Defendant has made no appearance, beyond filing the appeal papers, and because of his failure to do so the Attorney General, on May 1st, moved to have the case submitted on the record, which motion was granted.

It would seem more attention should be given an appeal where, as here, the record, including a transcript<page_number>Page 10</page_number>
of the evidence (of 338 pages), is furnished at the expense of the county.

We have examined into the different papers on file, including the evidence, and find that defendant was accorded a fair and impartial trial.

The judgment is therefore affirmed.
