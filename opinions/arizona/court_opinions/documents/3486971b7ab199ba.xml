This matter having come on for hearing before the Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Arizona, it having duly rendered its decision, there having been no discretionary review and <italic>sua sponte</italic> review having been declined by the Court,

IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that <bold>ROBERT R. JUNG</bold>, a member of the State Bar of Arizona, is hereby suspended from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months, effective thirty (30) days from the date of this order, for conduct in violation of his duties and obligations as a lawyer, as disclosed in the Disciplinary Commission Report.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, upon reinstatement, <bold>ROBERT R. JUNG</bold> shall be placed on probation for a period of six (6) months effective upon the signing of the probation contract. Bar Counsel shall notify the Disciplinary Clerk of the date on which the probation begins. The terms of probation are as follows:

<block_quote>  1) Respondent shall attend the State Bar's Trust Account Ethics Enhancement Program (TAEEP) prior to or within six months of reinstatement. In the event Respondent returns to private practice in a field of law requiring a trust account within six months of reinstatement, Respondent shall submit to at least one review of his trust account management procedures by the Staff Examiner of the State Bar or her designee through the Trust Account Program (TAP). Such review will include a review of Respondent's monthly three-way reconciliation of his general ledger, client ledgers and bank statement as well as any additional supporting documentation the Examiner in her discretion needs to review.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2) Respondent shall continue with counseling or other appropriate treatment during his suspension and for six months following the date of his reinstatement and shall substantiate his participation by authorizing his health care provider to provide a quarterly written confirmation of his continued participation to the director of the Members Assistance Program (MAP). In the event Respondent fails to provide such confirmation, bar counsel may require Respondent to submit to a MAP assessment and monitoring.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3) In the event that Respondent fails to comply with any of the foregoing conditions, and the State Bar receives information to that effect, bar counsel shall file with the Hearing Officer a Notice of Non-Compliance, pursuant to Rule 60(a)5, Ariz. R.S. Ct. The Hearing Officer shall conduct a hearing within thirty days after receipt of said notice, to determine whether the terms of probation have been violated and if an additional sanction should be imposed. In the event there is an allegation that any of these terms have been violated, the burden of proof shall be on the State Bar of Arizona to prove non-compliance by clear and convincing evidence.</block_quote>

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall comply with all the provisions of Rule 72, Rules of the Supreme Court of Arizona, including, but not limited to, Rule 72(a), which requires that Respondent notify all of his clients, within ten (10) days from the date hereof, of his inability to represent them and that he should promptly inform this Court of his compliance with this Order as provided in Rule 72(e).
