<posture>  This is before us on a wife's motion that we "reinstate" an order entered on July 9, 1976, in the Family Court, directing the husband to pay $75 a week for the support of five minor children. Previous to that time the husband had been ordered to pay the wife $50 a week for child support. The wife states that on January 28, 1977, the trial justice stayed<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> his original order and since that date the husband has been paying $50 a week.

We will treat the motion to reinstate as a motion to stay the January 28, 1977 stay issued by the trial justice. Since we have this day issued an opinion in the above-entitled case sustaining the husband's appeal from the July 9, 1976 order, there is no necessity that we consider the wife's motion.<page_number>Page 981</page_number>
Accordingly, the motion is denied pro forma.
