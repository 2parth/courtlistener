The defendants, Lisa J. Jacobson, M.D. and Women and Infants Hospital, appeal from a jury verdict of liability for the wrongful death of Djonen Oliveira, a newborn son born to the plaintiffs, Carri Oliveira and Jose Oliveira. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. The trial justice appropriately limited the jury's consideration to the named defendants and instructed the jurors not to consider the conduct of persons not before the Court. The defendants failed to present any evidence relative to the treatment of other health care professionals and the trial justice correctly instructed the jury on this issue. Further, there was evidence of the infant's pain and suffering sufficient to warrant consideration of a damage award for pain and suffering. Finally, the award of damages for economic loss was supported by the evidence. Contrary to the argument of defense counsel, the plaintiffs' expert witnesses testified that if the child had been timely delivered by cesarean section, he would be alive and well today. Consequently, the jury was entitled to award damages for the child's loss of earning capacity.
