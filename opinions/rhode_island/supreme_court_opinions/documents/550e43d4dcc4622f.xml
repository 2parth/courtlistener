<opinion_text>    The defendants have moved to dismiss this appeal on the grounds that there has not been compliance with Super. R. Civ. P. 54 (b). Upon examination of the record, we find defendants' contention to be accurate.

Accordingly, this case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings which may include, within the court's sound discretion, the entry of judgment accompanied by a Rule 54 (b) certificate.
