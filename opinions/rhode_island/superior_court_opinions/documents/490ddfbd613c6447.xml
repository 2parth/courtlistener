<opinion_text>    This is an appeal from a decision and order of the Rhode Island Board of Registration for Professional Engineers (Board). The appellant, John P. Caito (Caito), is appealing the Board's June 16, 1995 order suspending his professional engineer's license for a period of one year. Jurisdiction is pursuant to G.L. 1956 § <cross_reference>42-35-15</cross_reference>.

On July 29, 1993, Ralph A. Cataldo (Cataldo), a registered engineer in the State of Rhode Island, filed a complaint with the Board against Caito alleging a violation by Caito of G.L. §<cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference>(c), involving use and/or misuse of the professional engineer seal.

In December of 1985, the R.A. Cataldo Corporation (Cataldo Corp.) provided engineering services to Universal Properties, a real estate developer, in its efforts to develop land in Smithfield, Rhode Island, known as Diamond Head Estates, (the Project). At this time Caito held the title of Vice President in Charge of Private Development at Cataldo Corp. and was directly involved in the engineering work done for and on behalf of Universal Properties on the Project.

In July of 1988, Caito resigned from Cataldo Corp. in order to start his own engineering firm, the John P. Caito Corporation, (Caito Corp.). The Project continued to progress at this time, though then under the ownership and direction of Canmerica Inc., (Canmerica), which had purchased the project from Universal Properties. Cataldo Corp. continued its engineering services capacity and Caito, now independent of Cataldo Corp., served the owner in a consulting capacity testifying at planning board meetings in conjunction with Cataldo Corp. representatives. The Project did not come to fruition under Canmerica because the company declared bankruptcy while owing Cataldo Corp. some $90,000. Rhode Island Central Credit Union, (RICCU), as a holder of a Canmerica mortgage on the Project property, became its third owner.

The RICCU solicited engineering bids for completion of the project from both Cataldo Corp. and Caito Corporation. Caito Corp. won the job and proceeded to complete work initially commenced by Cataldo Corp. Cataldo's complaint to the Board arose upon his learning that plans, alleged to be remarkably similar to plans submitted by Cataldo Corp. to Canmerica and Canmerica's attorney in January of 1990 and bearing Cataldo's professional engineer's stamp, had been submitted to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) by Caito Corp. These plans, submitted by Caito on behalf of RICCU, also bore Caito's professional engineer's stamp.

The hearing, spanning four days, involved five witnesses and a volume of documentary evidence for the Board's consideration. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board found Caito's acts and omissions to be an unlawful violation of G.L. § 8-5-14(c) and imposed a one year suspension of Caito's license. The instant appeal followed.

<center>                       <bold><underline>Standard of Review</underline></bold></center>
The review of a decision of the Board is controlled by R.I.G.L. § <cross_reference>42-35-15</cross_reference>(g), which provides for review of a contested agency decision:

<block_quote>         "(g) The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</block_quote>

<block_quote>         (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</block_quote>

<block_quote>         (2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</block_quote>

<block_quote>         (3) Made upon unlawful procedure;</block_quote>

<block_quote>         (4) Affected by other error of law;</block_quote>

<block_quote>         (5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or</block_quote>

<block_quote>         (6) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion."</block_quote>

This section precludes a reviewing court from substituting its judgment for that of the agency in regard to the credibility of witnesses or the weight of evidence concerning questions of fact. <underline>Carmody v. R.I. Conflict of Interest Commission</underline>,<cross_reference>509 A.2d 453</cross_reference>, 458 (R.I. 1986). Therefore, this Court's review is limited to determining whether substantial evidence exists to support the Commission's decision. <underline>Newport Shipyard v. Rhode Island</underline><underline>Commission for Human Rights</underline>, <cross_reference>484 A.2d 893</cross_reference> (R.I. 1984). "Substantial evidence" is that which a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. <underline>Id</underline>. at 897. This is true even in cases where the court, after reviewing the certified record and evidence, might be inclined to view the evidence differently than the agency. <underline>Berberian v. Dept. of Employment Security</underline>,<cross_reference>414 A.2d 480</cross_reference>, 482 (R.I. 1980). This Court will "reverse factual conclusions of administrative agencies only when they are totally devoid of competent evidentiary support in the record." <underline>Milardo</underline><underline>v. Coastal Resources Management Council</underline>, <cross_reference>434 A.2d 266</cross_reference>, 272 (R.I. 1981). However, questions of law are not binding upon a reviewing court and may be freely reviewed to determine what the law is and its applicability to the facts. <underline>Carmody</underline>, <underline>supra</underline>. The Superior Court is required to uphold the agency's findings and conclusions if they are supported by competent evidence. <underline>Rhode Island Public</underline><underline>Telecommunications Authority, et al. v. Rhode Island Labor</underline><underline>Relations Board, et al.</underline>, <cross_reference>650 A.2d 479</cross_reference>, 485 (R.I. 1994).

<center>                      <bold><underline>The Board's Decision</underline></bold></center>
Caito asserts that his "primary contention" on appeal is that the Board erred in its statutory interpretation of G.L. §<cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference> (c). In essence Caito states that the Board, in its Decision and Order, applied only a "portion" of paragraph 14 (c) when, in fact, the entire paragraph was to be interpreted and applied.

The subject section of the statute reads:

<block_quote>              (c) Each registrant hereunder may upon registration obtain a seal of the design authorized by the board, bearing the registrant's name, serial number and the legend, "Registered professional engineer". Final engineering drawings, specifications, plats, and reports prepared by a registrant shall, when issued, be signed, dated and stamped with his or her seal or facsimile thereof. It shall be unlawful for an engineer to affix, or permit his or her seal or facsimile thereof to be affixed, to any work of which the engineer has not been responsibly charged to any engineering drawings, specifications, plats or reports after expiration of a certificate or for the purpose of aiding or abetting any other person to evade or attempt to evade any provision of this chapter. G.L. § <cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference> (c).</block_quote>

Caito frames the application of the statute to "<underline>only</underline>" require a factual inquiry as to whether a registrant had affixed his or her seal to any work for which the engineer was not responsibly charged "<underline>after the expiration of a certificate or for the purpose</underline><underline>of aiding or abetting any other person to evade or attempt to</underline><underline>evade any provision of this chapter.</underline>" (emphasis added by Caito). In fact, Caito asserts that one "<underline>could only</underline>" be in violation of paragraph (c) if he affixed his seal to work after his certificate had expired or he affixed his seal to any work for the purpose of aiding or abetting any other person to evade or attempt to evade provisions of the statute. Caito further notes that the Board's Decision and Order "(c)onspicuously and inexplicably" fails to find the two aforementioned enumerations which are, one or the other, requisite for a violation.

The Board did find that Caito's acts and omissions "violated the provisions of R.I. Gen. Laws, Title 5, Chapter 8, Paragraph 14(c) in that the respondent affixed his professional engineer's stamp to work that he was not in responsible charge of and over which he did not exercise direct control and supervision."

Due to the real or seeming ambiguity in a reading of the statute the Court will apply rules of statutory construction to glean the intent of the section. <underline>Rhode Island State Police Lodge</underline><underline>No. 25 v. State</underline>, <cross_reference>485 A.2d 1245</cross_reference>, 1247 (R.I. 1984). The legislative history of the statute is particularly instructive. This history evidences that the "modern" version of the engineering act became law on July 1, 1990. P.L. 1990, ch. 330, § 2. The following year the section and paragraph at issue underwent further amendment. P.L. 1991, ch. 304, § 1 (effective July 1, 1991).

The 1991 Public Law reads in pertinent part as follows:

<block_quote>         It shall be unlawful for an engineer [<strikethrough>or land</strikethrough> <strikethrough>surveyor</strikethrough>]<footnote_reference>[fn]</footnote_reference> to affix, or permit his or her seal or facsimile thereof to be affixed, [<underline>to</underline> <underline>any work of which the engineer has not been</underline> <underline>responsibly charged,</underline>]<footnote_reference>[fn]</footnote_reference> to any engineering drawings, specifications, plats or reports after expiration of a certificate or for the purpose of aiding or abetting any other person to evade or attempt to evade any provision of this chapter. (emphasis supplied)</block_quote>

The comma following the word "charged" was omitted in the ministerial act of codifying the public law into its final statutory form. However, a natural reading of the paragraph clearly brings out the intent of the statute, and the Board applied this plain and ordinary meaning.

The Board correctly found that an unlawful violation would in fact occur if a registered engineer affixed, or permitted his or her seal or facsimile thereof to be affixed, to any work of which the engineer was not responsibly charged. This act or omission, in and of itself, constitutes an unlawful violation of the Act. G.L. § <cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference>(c).

This Court notes that this statute which respondent violated, as applied by the Board in its Decision and Order, underwent amendment at roughly the same time as the misconduct. G.L. §<cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference>, as amended, took effect, July 1, 1991. Caito's misconduct began in and around August 1990 when negotiations with RICCU began and since it <underline>continued</underline> through the effective date of the amendment, he is charged with its observance. <underline>See</underline> <underline>American Power</underline><underline> Light Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission</underline>, <cross_reference>141 F.2d 606</cross_reference>
(C.C.A. 1st Cir. 1944).

<center>                      <bold><underline>"Responsibly Charged"</underline></bold></center>
Caito states that while under Cataldo Corp's employ, the Diamond Head Project was under his responsible charge. A term of art within its field, "responsible charge" is statutorily defined as "direct control and supervision of engineering work." G.L. § <cross_reference>5-8-3</cross_reference>(h). The Board reviewed testimony that Caito was in fact in responsible charge of the Project while at Cataldo Corp. However, 75% of the work ultimately completed by Cataldo Corp. on the Project occurred after his departure from the Company's employ and under the responsible charge of another registered engineer. These final plans were ultimately submitted by DEM bearing the stamp of both Cataldo and Caito.

The Board ruled, in applying § <cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference> (c), that a registered engineer cannot affix his seal to work for which he is not responsibly charged. This interpretation of the section is in accord with the plain and ordinary meaning of the statute as previously established. <underline>Ellis</underline> at 1058 (R.I. 1991). Caito asserts that he worked with Cataldo's plans only after receiving assurances from the developer at the time, RICCU, that he was free to do so. However, pursuant to G.L. § <cross_reference>5-8-1</cross_reference> <italic>et seq.</italic>, the Board correctly determined that Caito cannot look to RICCU or his counsel of the time for assurances as to his conduct in an effort to deflect the laws and regulations to which he, as a registered professional engineer, is subject.

<center>               <bold><underline>Misappropriation of Cataldo's Work</underline></bold></center>
Finally, Caito asserts that there is absolutely no prohibition against revising the plan of another engineer with whom an engineer has worked on a project, if it is expressly disclosed as to which engineer is responsible for that work. The natural progression and conclusion of this argument is that Caito could lawfully work on Cataldo's stamped plans as long as Caito so stamped his work on the same plans. The Board rejected this argument. Again, the Board's finding of a violation here is clearly supported by the aforementioned reading of G.L. §<cross_reference>5-8-14</cross_reference> (c). The Board observing that it is painfully apparent that (Caito) assimilated most if not all of the work of (Cataldo Corp.) and then submitted it to State regulatory agencies for approval. This conclusion of the Board, itself a panel of engineers with expertise in the field, is entitled to substantial deference by this Court. <underline>Rhode Island Higher Educ. Assistance</underline><underline>Authority v. Secretary, U.S. Dept. of Educ.</underline>, <cross_reference>929 F.2d 844</cross_reference>, 857 (1st Cir. 1991).

Upon review of the entire record, this Court finds that the decision of the Board is supported by reliable, substantive and probative evidence, and there is no violation of constitutional, statutory or ordinance provisions. The Court further finds that the Board did not act in excess of authority and its decision is neither clearly erroneous in view of the record nor is it arbitrary or capricious. Accordingly, the decision of the Board is affirmed.

Counsel shall submit the appropriate judgment for entry.
