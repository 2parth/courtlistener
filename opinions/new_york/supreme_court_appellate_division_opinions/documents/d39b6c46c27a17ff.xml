in the third degree, and placed him with the Office of Children and Family Services for a period of 18 months, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

<opinion_text>  The court's finding was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the weight of the evidence (<italic>see People v Danielson</italic>, <cross_reference>9 NY3d 342</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>348-349</cross_reference> [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the court's credibility determinations. The record fails to support appellant's assertion that the victim exaggerated the extent of appellant's unlawful conduct.
