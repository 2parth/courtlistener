<opinion_text>  Petitioner's application for modification of a custody and visitation order was dismissed, without prejudice, for his failure to comply with a pretrial scheduling order. He appealed, but in the interim, respondent filed another petition for modification of custody and visitation and petitioner filed a cross petition seeking the same relief. In February 2006, on consent, a custody and visitation order was entered, rendering this appeal moot (<italic>see Matter of Rebecca</italic><italic>O. v Todd P.</italic>, <cross_reference>309 AD2d 982</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>983</cross_reference> [2003]; <italic>Matter of</italic><italic>Siberio v Siberio</italic>, <cross_reference>208 AD2d 994</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>994</cross_reference> [1994]).

Ordered that the appeal is dismissed, as moot, without costs.
