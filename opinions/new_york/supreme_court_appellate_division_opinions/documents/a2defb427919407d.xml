<posture>  Determination of respondent New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, dated August 12, 2004, upholding a determination by respondent City Department of Social Services to restrict petitioner's Medical Assistance authorization to a single primary provider and a single pharmacy, unanimously confirmed, the petition denied and the proceeding brought pursuant to CPLR article 78 (transferred to this Court by order of the Supreme Court, New York County [Karen S. Smith, J.], entered April 18, 2005) dismissed, without costs.

</posture><attorneys>  South Brooklyn Legal Services Corp., Brooklyn (Peter A. Kempner of counsel), for petitioner.

<opinion_text>  There was substantial evidence adduced at the hearing to show that, while receiving Medical Assistance, petitioner obtained a prescription for a nutritional supplement from his primary care doctor and an overlapping prescription for a nearly identical nutritional supplement from a second doctor, and that, during a five-month period, he used seven pharmacies to obtain 59 prescriptions. The record accordingly demonstrates that petitioner received "duplicative, excessive, contraindicated or conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies" (<italic>see</italic><cross_reference>18 NYCRR 360-6.4</cross_reference>). Contrary to petitioner's argument, the recipient information packet accompanying the notice of intent to restrict Medicaid served on petitioner (<italic>see</italic> 18 NYCRR 360.6-4 [a] [4]) was not improper or based on a legally inadequate investigation. Nor do we find that the administrative law judge was remiss in performing his regulatory duties (<italic>see Matter of Roberts v.</italic><italic>Dowling</italic>, <cross_reference>216 AD2d 13</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>14</cross_reference> [1995]).
