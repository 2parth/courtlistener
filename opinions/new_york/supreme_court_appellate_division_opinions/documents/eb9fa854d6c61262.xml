<posture>  Appeal from the Supreme Court, Kings County (Owens, J.).

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Judgment affirmed.

On the record presented, we find that the defendant made inculpatory statements after the proper administration of<italic>Miranda</italic> warnings. Therefore, the hearing court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the statements.

Defendant did not move to withdraw his plea at the allocation or at sentencing. Having failed to raise any objections to the adequacy of the plea allocation in the court of first instance, defendant has not preserved the issue for appellate review as a matter of law (see <italic>People v Pellegrino</italic>, <cross_reference>60 N.Y.2d 636</cross_reference>; <italic>People v</italic><italic>Fernandez</italic>, <cross_reference>91 A.D.2d 1073</cross_reference>). In any event, we find that the allocation was proper (<italic>People v Nixon</italic>, <cross_reference>21 N.Y.2d 338</cross_reference>, cert. den.<italic>sub nom. Robinson v New York</italic>, <cross_reference>393 U.S. 1067</cross_reference>).

We have reviewed defendant's remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Titone, J.P., Lazer, Bracken and Boyers, JJ., concur.
