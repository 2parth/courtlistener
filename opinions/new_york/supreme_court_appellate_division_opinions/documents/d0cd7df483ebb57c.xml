<opinion_text>  Petition unanimously granted, without costs, determination annulled and respondent directed to comply with the public hearing requirements of EDPL article 2. Memorandum: Petitioners seek review of respondent's determination that a proposed taking of an eight-foot strip along the north edge of petitioners' property for the purpose of building a sidewalk is <italic>de minimis</italic>
and, hence, not subject to compliance with the provisions of EDPL<cross_reference>206</cross_reference> (subd [D]).

Having considered the quantity of land sought to be acquired, nearly 2,600 square feet of petitioners' residential lot, and the<page_number>Page 1141</page_number>
significant public controversy revealed by the record over the location of the sidewalk, we find that the proposed taking is not<italic>de minimis</italic> and direct respondent to comply with the public hearing requirements of EDPL article 2. (EDPL <cross_reference>207</cross_reference>, subd [B].)
