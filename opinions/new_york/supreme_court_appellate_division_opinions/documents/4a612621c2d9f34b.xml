<posture>  Appeal from the Supreme Court, Queens County (Eiber, J., Rotker, J.).

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

The evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to permit a rational trier of facts to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt <italic>(see, People v Contes</italic>, <cross_reference>60 N.Y.2d 620</cross_reference>). The mere existence of conflicting evidence did not preclude the defendant's conviction <italic>(see, People v Kennedy</italic>, <cross_reference>47 N.Y.2d 196</cross_reference>) and the jury's findings on the issues of credibility are to be accorded the greatest weight on appeal <italic>(see, People v Malizia</italic>,<cross_reference>62 N.Y.2d 755</cross_reference>, <italic>cert denied</italic> <cross_reference>469 U.S. 932</cross_reference>). Mollen, P.J., Brown, Niehoff and Kooper, JJ., concur.
