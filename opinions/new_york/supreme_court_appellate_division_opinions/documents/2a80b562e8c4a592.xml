<posture>  Appeal from the Supreme Court, Queens County (Glass, J.).

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.

On appeal, the defendant argues that the jury verdict finding him guilty of unauthorized use of a vehicle was against the weight of the evidence. Upon the exercise of our factual review power <italic>(see</italic>, CPL <cross_reference>470.15</cross_reference> [5]), we find that the evidence adduced at trial clearly established that the defendant, knowing that he did not have the consent of the vehicle's owner, took the vehicle and operated it <italic>(see</italic>, Penal Law ยง <cross_reference>165.05</cross_reference>). Mangano, J.P., Bracken, Lawrence and Spatt, JJ., concur.
