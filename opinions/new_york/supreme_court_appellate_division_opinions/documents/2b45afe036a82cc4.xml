<opinion_text>  As the People correctly concede, defendant was improperly sentenced as a second violent felony offender on his conviction for attempted assault in the second degree. Accordingly, we find him to be a second felony offender with respect to that conviction, and modify the sentence on that conviction to 2 to 4 years.

THIS CONSTITUTES THE DECISION AND ORDER OF SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, FIRST DEPARTMENT.
