ORDERED that the judgment is affirmed, with costs.

Contrary to the appellant's contention, the Supreme Court did not err in denying the petition. The respondent's determination to refuse to extend the period in which the petitioner could apply for the 1998 early retirement incentive (see, L 1998 ch 47) was neither arbitrary nor capricious (cf., Matter of Pell v. Board of Educ., <cross_reference>34 N.Y.2d 222</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>231</cross_reference>).

SULLIVAN, J.P., FLORIO, LUCIANO and FEUERSTEIN, JJ., concur.
