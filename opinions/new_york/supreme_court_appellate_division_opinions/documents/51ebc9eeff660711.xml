<posture>  Appeal from the Wayne County Court, Strobridge, J.

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: The trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's request for instructions on intoxication and the defense of justification. The record, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant <italic>(see, People v.</italic><italic>Padgett</italic>, <cross_reference>60 N.Y.2d 142</cross_reference>), reveals nothing from which the jury could rationally conclude that defendant believed he was threatened with deadly physical force or that defendant sought to withdraw from the encounter or that his reactions were those of a reasonable man acting in self-defense <italic>(see</italic>, Penal Law § <cross_reference>35.15</cross_reference>;<italic>People v. Reynoso</italic>, <cross_reference>73 N.Y.2d 816</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>818</cross_reference>, <italic>habeas corpus denied sub</italic><italic>nom. Reynoso v. Leonardo</italic>, <cross_reference>735 F. Supp. 134</cross_reference>, <italic>affd.</italic> 916 F.2d 709). Also, there was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant's mental or physical faculties were impaired by alcohol <italic>(see, People v. Rodriguez</italic>, <cross_reference>76 N.Y.2d 918</cross_reference>;<italic>People v. Perry</italic>, <cross_reference>61 N.Y.2d 849</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>850</cross_reference>).

We have reviewed defendant's remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.
