<posture>  Appeal from the Supreme Court, Queens County (Smith, J.).

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Ordered that the judgment is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.<page_number>Page 579</page_number>

The appellant's contention that the individual retirement account that he deposited with the defendant Dime Savings Bank of New York is exempt from an application to satisfy a money judgment pursuant to CPLR <cross_reference>5205</cross_reference> (c) (2) is without merit. While the account apparently was created as a result of a rollover from a corporate retirement plan in conformity with <cross_reference>26 U.S.C. § 408</cross_reference> (d) (3), it does not constitute "either a Keogh (HR-10), retirement or other plan established by a corporation" (CPLR <cross_reference>5205</cross_reference> [c] [2]), and therefore is not entitled to the protection of CPLR <cross_reference>5205</cross_reference><italic>(see, European Am. Bank  Trust Co. v. H. Frenkel, Ltd.</italic>,<cross_reference>147 Misc.2d 423</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>424</cross_reference>; <italic>see also, Long Is. Jewish Hillside Med.

We have considered the appellant's remaining contentions and find them to be unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, without merit. Rosenblatt, J.P., Lawrence, Altman and Goldstein, JJ., concur.
