<posture>  Appeal from the Supreme Court, New York County (Frederic S. Berman, J.).

</posture>
<opinion_text>  Defendant's conviction for burglary is supported by the evidence that defendant was found hiding inside a closed grocery only a short distance from where merchandise had been piled into a number of plastic bags, and evidence that a hole had been made in the locked door to a locker room and a cash register bore pry marks. The court's <italic>Sandoval</italic> ruling, which allowed the prosecutor to cross-examine defendant about two of his several aliases, the fact that he had a felony conviction and more than a half dozen misdemeanor charges<page_number>Page 423</page_number>
was not an abuse of discretion. The probative value of a representative showing of defendant's past criminal history and his use of aliases was not outweighed by the potential of prejudice to defendant. <italic>(People v Williams</italic>, <cross_reference>56 N.Y.2d 236</cross_reference>.) Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the prosecutor's cross-examination or summation, and the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant.

Concur â€” Sullivan, J.P., Carro, Rosenberger, Wallach and Rubin, JJ.
