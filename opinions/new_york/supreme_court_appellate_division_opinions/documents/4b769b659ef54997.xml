<opinion_text>  It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a jury verdict of, inter alia, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (Penal Law ยง <cross_reference>265.02</cross_reference> [1]) and criminal mischief in the third degree (ยง 145.05 [2]). Contrary to defendant's contention, the conviction of criminal possession of a weapon is supported by legally sufficient evidence (<italic>see generally People v Bleakley</italic>,<cross_reference>69 NY2d 490</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>495</cross_reference> [1987]). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People, as we must (<italic>see People v</italic><italic>Contes</italic>, <cross_reference>60 NY2d 620</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>621</cross_reference> [1983]), we conclude that the evidence that defendant pulled out a knife and a pair of scissors when he was prevented from leaving the store in question as well as the evidence that he violently broke the glass in a door in order to escape from the store is legally sufficient to establish that he considered the knife and pair of scissors to be "weapon[s] of significance . . . and not . . . innocent utilitarian utensil[s]" (<italic>Matter of Jamie</italic><italic>D.</italic>, <cross_reference>59 NY2d 589</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>594</cross_reference> [1983]; <italic>see also Matter of Sean</italic><italic>R.</italic>, <cross_reference>33 AD3d 925</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>926</cross_reference> [2006]). We further conclude that the verdict with respect to that count is not against the weight of the evidence (<italic>see generally Bleakley</italic>, <cross_reference>69 NY2d at 495</cross_reference>).

Contrary to defendant's further contention, County Court's adverse inference charge was an appropriate sanction for the inadvertent destruction of the knife and pair of scissors at issue (<italic>see generally People v Martinez</italic>, <cross_reference>71 NY2d 937</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>940</cross_reference> [1988]). The testimony of the People's witness provided a sufficient description of the items, and defense counsel "made effective use of" the destruction of the items in cross-examining the People's witnesses as well as on summation (<italic>People v Wilson</italic>, <cross_reference>2 AD3d 185</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>186</cross_reference> [2003], <italic>lv</italic><italic>denied</italic> <cross_reference>1 NY3d 603</cross_reference> [2004]). Finally, we reject the contention of defendant that the court erred in sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment (<italic>see People v</italic><italic>Laureano</italic>, <cross_reference>87 NY2d 640</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>643</cross_reference> [1996]; <italic>People v</italic><italic>Frazier</italic>, <cross_reference>212 AD2d 976</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>977</cross_reference> [1995]), and we otherwise reject his challenge to the severity of the sentence.<page_number>Page 1283</page_number>
