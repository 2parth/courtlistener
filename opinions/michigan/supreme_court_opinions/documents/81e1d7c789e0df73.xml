<opinion_text>  On order of the Court, the delayed application for leave to appeal from the September 3, 1999 decision of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court. The motion to remand for an evidentiary hearing is DENIED.
