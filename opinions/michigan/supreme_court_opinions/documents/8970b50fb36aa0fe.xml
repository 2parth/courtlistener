<opinion_text>  COA: 244106, Wayne CC: 02-007229

On order of the Court, motion for immediate consideration is GRANTED. The application for leave to appeal from the October 7, 2002, decision of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court.
