<opinion_text>  <italic>Summary Disposition.</italic>

On May 10, 2007, the Court heard oral argument on the applications for leave to appeal the August 1, 2006, judgment of the Court of Appeals. On order of the Court, the applications are again considered. MCR 7.302(G)(1). In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we affirm only that portion of the Court of Appeals judgment holding that the vehicles in question are exempt from the imposition of a use tax under the resale exemption contained in MCL <cross_reference>205.94</cross_reference>(1)(c). The MCL <cross_reference>205.94</cross_reference>(1)(c) "purchased for resale" exemption precludes use tax under MCL <cross_reference>205.93</cross_reference>(1). We vacate the balance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals and adopt the trial court's August 2, 2005, opinion and order holding that MCL<cross_reference>205.94</cross_reference>(1)(c) applies and that no use tax is due. The "exemption for demonstration purposes" exemption of MCL <cross_reference>205.94</cross_reference>(1)(c) and the "purchased for resale" exemption of MCL <cross_reference>205.94</cross_reference>(1)(c) are independent of one another; both provide exemptions from use tax upon satisfaction of applicable statutory criteria. The Court of Appeals also erred in applying the Black's Law Dictionary definition of "consumer," rather than the statutory definition of "consumer" set forth in MCL <cross_reference>205.92</cross_reference>(g). "We need not, indeed we must not, search afield for meanings where the act supplies its own." <italic>W S Butterfield Theatres, Inc v Dep't of</italic><italic>Revenue</italic>, <cross_reference>353 Mich 345</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>350</cross_reference> (1958).

I concur in the result.

KELLY, J. I would grant leave to appeal.
