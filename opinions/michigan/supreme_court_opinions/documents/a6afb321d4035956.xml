<opinion_text>  On order of the Court, the court appointed receiver's motion for immediate consideration is considered, and it is GRANTED.  The defendant's delayed application for leave to appeal from the September 22, 1999, order of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.

Court of Appeals No. 222134.
