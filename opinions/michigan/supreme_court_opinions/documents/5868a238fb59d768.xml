<opinion_text>  COA:  213435, Michigan, WCAC: 95-000546.

On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal from the November 5, 1999, decision of the Court of Appeals, is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court.

Kelly, J., would grant leave to appeal.
