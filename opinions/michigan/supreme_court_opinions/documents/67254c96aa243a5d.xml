<opinion_text>    On order of the Court, the delayed application for leave to appeal from the June 5, 1998, decision and the October 6, 1998, order of the Court of Appeals, is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.

Court of Appeals No. 197876.
