<opinion_text>  SC: 117741

Plaintiff filed a complaint for mandamus and this Court, by order of May 25, 2001, directed the parties to provide the Court certain information. The parties have complied with that directive. By further order dated September 18, 2001, this Court directed defendant to exercise its discretion under Rule 7 of the Board of Law Examiners concerning plaintiff's request that it waive the requirement that he possess a degree from a reputable and qualified law school. Defendant has complied with that directive and determined that plaintiff has made an adequate showing for a waiver of the requirement. On order of the Court, the complaint for mandamus is again considered, and, it is DISMISSED as moot.
