<underline>Staff Comment</underline>: The amendment of MCR 7.204(C)(5) makes the terminology consistent with current usage. See MCR 8.119(D)(1)(c). The amendment also clarifies the distinction between the lower court register of actions and the Court of Appeals docketing statement referred to in MCR 7.204(H) and 7.205(D)(3).

The staff comment is not an authoritative construction by the Court.
