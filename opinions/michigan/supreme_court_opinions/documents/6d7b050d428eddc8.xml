<opinion_text>  On order of the Court, the delayed application for leave to appeal from the November 5, 1999 decision of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court. The motion for stay is also considered, and it is DENIED.

Leave to Appeal Denied March 28, 2000:

Court of Appeals No. 221620, Macomb CC: 98-001612-CZ.
