<opinion_text>  COA: 204840, Wayne CC: 96-635359-CZ

On order of the Court, the motion for immediate consideration is considered and it is GRANTED. The application for leave to appeal from the May 21, 2001 decision of the Court of Appeals and the motion for stay are considered, and they are DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court.
