<opinion_text>  COA: 217194, Clinton CC: 98-006493-FH.

On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal from the October 3, 2000 decision of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court. The motion for peremptory reversal is also considered, and it is DENIED.
