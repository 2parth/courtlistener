</posture>
<opinion_text>  Summary Disposition March 30, 2011.

Pursuant to MCR 7.302(H)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals to the extent that it held that res judicata did not bar the plaintiffs cause of action to enforce correction orders issued to the defendant pursuant to MCL <cross_reference>333.12709</cross_reference>(1). The basis for those orders was the same conduct that was the basis for the action to revoke the defendant's certificate of registration under MCL <cross_reference>333.12709</cross_reference>(2). Enforcement of the correction orders could have been resolved in the prior proceeding between the parties. <italic>Adair v Michigan</italic>, <cross_reference>470 Mich 105</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>121</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>124-125</cross_reference>
(2004). In all other respects, leave to appeal is denied.
