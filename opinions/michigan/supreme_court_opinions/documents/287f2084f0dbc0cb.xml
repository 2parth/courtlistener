SC: 143149, COA: 302983, Berrien CC: 2009-004064-FC.

On order of the Court, the motions for immediate consideration and for miscellaneous relief are GRANTED. The application for leave to appeal the April 22, 2011 order of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
