<opinion_text>  SC: 129852, COA: 256184, Jackson CC: 03-000258-FH.

On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the September 27, 2005 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this Court.

KELLY, J., would hold this case in abeyance for <italic>People v. Drohan</italic>, lv gtd <cross_reference>472 Mich 881</cross_reference> (2005).
