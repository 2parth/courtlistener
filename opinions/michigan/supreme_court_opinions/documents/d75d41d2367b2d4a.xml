On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal from the November 30, 2001 decision of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is GRANTED, limited to Issues I and II in the application for leave, concerning the viability of <italic>Manuel v Weitzman</italic>, <cross_reference>386 Mich. 157</cross_reference> (1971), in this factual context, and the claim that, in ice and snow slip-and-fall cases, SJI2d 19.03 and 19.05 are inherently inconsistent. The parties are directed to address the possibility that the giving of SJI2d 13.02 was contradicted by additionally giving SJI2d 19.03 and, if so, whether that effectively violated former MCL 436.22(1), which made an action under the dramshop statute the "exclusive remedy for money damages against the licensee arising out of the selling, giving, or furnishing of alcoholic liquor."
