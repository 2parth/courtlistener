<opinion_text>  SC: 130075, COA: 255724, Wayne CC: 03-012445-01.

On order of the Court, the application for leave to appeal the October 18, 2005 judgment of the Court of Appeals is considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.

KELLY, J., would grant leave to appeal.
