<opinion_text>  Actions on Applications for Leave to Appeal from the Court of Appeals.

<italic>Summary Dispositions September 12, 2007:</italic>

Pursuant to MCR 7.302(G)(1), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the Genesee Circuit Court and we remand this case to the Genesee Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this order. The Court of Appeals committed plain error by finding that this Court's decision in <italic>People v Williams</italic>,<cross_reference>475 Mich 245</cross_reference> (2006), did not apply to this case. The prosecutor's appeal raised and preserved the question whether the trial court erred by finding a violation of MCL <cross_reference>780.131</cross_reference>(1) and dismissing the information with prejudice. In light of the record and the Court of Appeals conclusion that "it is not clear when, or even if, the [D]epartment of [C]orrections provided to the prosecutor `written notice of the placement of imprisonment of the inmate and a request for final disposition of the [criminal charge]' as envisioned by MCL <cross_reference>780.131</cross_reference>(1)," defendant did not establish on the existing record that the Department of Corrections caused to be delivered by certified mail to the prosecuting attorney the written notice, request, and statement as required by MCL<cross_reference>780.131</cross_reference>(1). See <italic>People v Holt</italic>, <cross_reference>478 Mich 851</cross_reference> (2007). On remand, the Genesee Circuit Court is directed to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if and when the Department of Corrections caused to be delivered by certified mail to the prosecuting attorney the written notice, request, and statement required by MCL <cross_reference>780.131</cross_reference>(1). We do not retain jurisdiction.
