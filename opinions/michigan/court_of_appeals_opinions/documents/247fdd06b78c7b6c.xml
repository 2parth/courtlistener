<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Plaintiffs filed an original and two amended complaints asserting alternative and inconsistent theories and seeking declaratory relief. The trial court granted plaintiffs a declaratory judgment based on one of those theories. Plaintiffs now appeal therefrom.

GCR 1963, 521 provides for declaratory relief. GCR 1963, <cross_reference>111.1</cross_reference>
provides that declaratory relief may be sought as part of a statement of claim and permits it to be made in the alternative. GCR 1963, 521.5 provides that "[d]eclaratory judgments shall have the force and effect of final judgments and shall be reviewable as final judgments". GCR 1963, 806.1 states that "* * * an<italic>aggrieved party</italic> shall have a right to appeal from all final judgments or final orders from the Circuit Courts * * *". (Emphasis supplied.)

In a situation where a party seeks inconsistent relief, because the trial court can grant only one of the requested remedies, the party is not aggrieved by the denial of the other. <italic>Bell Rose</italic><italic>Sanitarium,</italic><page_number>Page 526</page_number><italic>Inc v Metz,</italic> <cross_reference>246 Or. 475</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>425 P.2d 168</cross_reference> (1967), <italic>Gamble v Gamble,</italic><cross_reference>24 App. Div. 2d 625</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>262 N.Y.S.2d 214</cross_reference> (1965), <italic>Printup v Smith,</italic><cross_reference>212 Ga. 501</cross_reference>; <cross_reference>93 S.E.2d 679</cross_reference> (1956). Because the instant case falls within the ambit of that rule, plaintiffs are not aggrieved parties and, consequently, lack standing to appeal.
