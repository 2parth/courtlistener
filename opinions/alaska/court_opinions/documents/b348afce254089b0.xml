<opinion_text>  Approximately two years after entering a guilty plea to felony concealment of merchandise, Frank Huley filed an application for post-conviction relief seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. Huley claimed that, due to a head injury which he suffered several months before entering his plea, he did not understand the nature and consequences<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
of entering the plea. Following a hearing, Superior Court Judge Michael A. Thompson concluded that Huley had not shown that his plea was involuntary or that he was unable to understand the nature of his plea. Huley appeals. We affirm.

<heading><italic>Factual and procedural background</italic></heading>
In December 2002, Frank Huley pled guilty to one count of felony concealment of merchandise.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> In exchange for this plea, the State dismissed a charge of violating conditions of release, as well as several misdemeanor charges pending against Huley in two of his unrelated cases. The parties agreed that sentencing would be left open. Superior Court Judge Trevor N. Stephens advised Huley of his legal rights to go to trial and of the consequences of his plea before accepting the plea. Four months later, Judge Stephens sentenced Huley to 3 years of imprisonment with 2 years suspended. On November 30, 2004, Huley filed an application for post-conviction relief seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. A court-appointed attorney reviewed the application and determined that only one claim was colorable: that Huley, due to a head injury suffered in April 2002, "did not fully understand the nature and consequences of entering his plea" in December 2002. Huley alleged that he suffered a serious head injury in April 2002 when his daughter's boyfriend "kicked [him] in the head a number of times." According to the attorney, an evidentiary hearing was required to allow Huley to "present medical evidence and . . . testimony as to [Huley's] ability to perceive and understand events at the time of his change of plea[.]"

Superior Court Judge Michael A. Thompson conducted an evidentiary hearing on Huley's post-conviction relief application in September 2005. Huley presented two witnesses. First, Dr. Keith Cannon explained that he treated Huley for his head injury<page_number>Page 3</page_number>
three times in the months just before Huley pled guilty. Dr. Cannon testified that he worked as an internist at the Wilson Clinic in Ketchikan in 2002. Huley visited Dr. Cannon at the Wilson Clinic for the first time on April 18, 2002. (Huley had also seen a different doctor — Dr. Ernie Meloche — at the emergency room on April 1 or 2 soon after he was kicked in the head.) Huley complained to Dr. Cannon that he had difficulty hearing in one ear, a constant headache, and felt off-balance. Dr. Cannon reviewed Huley's medical records, including a CT scan from the emergency room visit which indicated "periorbital swelling." Based on Huley's complaints, Dr. Cannon concluded in his assessment that Huley "had [a] history of head trauma as he had reported it" so he prescribed some pain medicine and advised Huley to visit an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Dr. Cannon testified that the record did not show that Huley ever visited a specialist.

Huley visited Dr. Cannon again on May 28, 2002. Huley complained again of feeling off-balance and having neck pain. Dr. Cannon ordered a follow-up CT scan, which revealed no swelling or other injury. Dr. Cannon saw Huley for the final time on July 17, 2002, when Huley complained of blurred vision in his left eye, bloody discharge from one ear, and feeling off-balance when walking. The examination revealed nothing abnormal with Huley's ear and no observable balance difficulties. Dr. Cannon recommended an MRI scan to aid in treatment.

Dr. Cannon testified that Huley's complaints could have been the result of a head injury. Dr. Cannon said that "he never questioned the validity of what [Huley] complained of." But Dr. Cannon also testified that each of these complaints were subjective and had not been objectively verified. Dr. Cannon also cautioned that he could not render an opinion as to Huley's legal competency at the time leading up to his plea. But Dr. Cannon was able to testify that Huley could coherently interact during their visits and stated that he did not question Huley's ability to consent to medical treatment.<page_number>Page 4</page_number>

Judge Thompson concluded by asking Dr. Cannon:

<block_quote>  [I]n any of those [visits with Huley] did he report any cognitive deficits, that he was confused, that he was forgetful, that he didn't know where he was or he didn't understand who you were? Did anything like that evidence itself either in his report or in your observations?</block_quote>

Dr. Cannon replied, "No."

Finally, Dr. Cannon testified that Huley had returned to the Wilson Clinic in February 2003 (after his initial plea, but before sentencing), but had seen a different doctor — Dr. Peter Rice.

Huley testified on his own behalf. He explained that his injury was caused when his daughter's boyfriend repeatedly kicked him in the head. Huley provided a letter from the Violent Crimes Compensation Board which demonstrated that the Board had awarded Huley over $5000 in compensation for lost wages and to enable him to visit a neurologist in Seattle. But Huley did not see a neurologist; he claimed that he was unable to because of his guilty plea and resulting imprisonment.

As to the impact of his injury, Huley testified that, "[e]verything seem[ed] cloudy. I would think I'm doing something and actually I wasn't doing it. . . . Everything seemed muddy, cloudy, unclear, unsure." He testified that he suffered blurred vision, bleeding from the ears, pain, and mental stress. He said this affected his ability to think, communicate, and understand. Huley stated that he still felt the impact of the injury over three years later. However, on cross-examination, the State — in an effort to impeach Huley's credibility — established that Huley had been convicted of at least five crimes involving dishonesty.

In addition to Dr. Cannon, Huley had seen at least three other doctors — Drs. Rice, Lee, and Meloche. But none of these three doctors were present in court and Huley<page_number>Page 5</page_number>
did not have the appropriate medical reports, so he asked that the trial record be kept open for further evidence.

The State provided testimony from Huley's probation officer, Jessica Mathews, who had supervised Huley from December 2003 to early fall of 2004. She testified that Huley never appeared confused as to time and place during their meetings. Mathews referred to Huley as "manipulative" and stated that she felt he had the cognitive ability to understand what was going on during each of their visits. Mathews testified that she had never observed Huley walk with an uneven gait and that she had even seen him on ladders.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Thompson allowed Huley thirty days to supplement the record with documentation from the other doctors who treated him. Huley did not submit any additional testimony or medical records.

At the close of this thirty-day period, Judge Thompson ruled that Huley had not shown that his plea was involuntary or that he was unable to understand the plea proceedings. Judge Thompson therefore denied Huley's application for post-conviction relief.

Under Alaska Criminal Rule 11(h)(3) and AS <cross_reference>12.72.040</cross_reference>, Huley had the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was entitled to withdraw his plea.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> In order to prevail, Huley had to show that Judge Thompson's factual findings were clearly erroneous.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Judge Thompson's findings are supported by the record. Huley never substantiated his claim that his head injury impacted his decision to enter his plea. Dr.<page_number>Page 6</page_number>
Cannon's testimony only recounted Huley's subjective complaint. Dr. Cannon repeatedly stated that he was unable to objectively verify the injury's impact on Huley's ability to enter a plea. Judge Thompson gave Huley extra time to cure this defect. But Huley did not present any additional evidence to support his claims. Beyond not providing medical evidence of a cognitive impact, Huley also failed to present any witnesses to testify that they noticed any impacts from the brain injury which would have made it difficult for Huley to function rationally. Specifically, Huley did not call his trial attorney, who would presumably have been able to testify whether Huley was able to properly evaluate whether to enter a guilty plea. However, Huley's probation officer did testify that Huley appeared to be acting normally.

Huley's argument boils down to a contention that Judge Thompson erred in not accepting Huley's testimony. But Judge Thompson was not required to do this. The record shows that there were many reasons why Judge Thompson might not have been persuaded by Huley's testimony, which was unsubstantiated and arguably self-serving. We conclude that Judge Thompson's findings are not clearly erroneous and that he did not err in concluding that Huley failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was entitled to withdraw his plea. We accordingly conclude that Judge Thompson did not err in dismissing Huley's application for post-conviction relief.

The judgment of the superior court is AFFIRMED.
