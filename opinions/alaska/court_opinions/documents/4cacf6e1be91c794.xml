<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Upon appellant's plea of no contest to eleven counts of forgery,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> the superior court imposed a sentence of four years on each count,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> to run concurrently. Appellant was made eligible for parole at the discretion of<page_number>Page 73</page_number>
the parole board.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>
In this appeal she challenges the court's sentence as excessive.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

Our review of the record fails to persuade us that the superior court was clearly mistaken in imposing the sanction that it did.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> Accordingly, its sentence is affirmed. <italic>McClain v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>519 P.2d 811</cross_reference> (Alaska 1974).

<block_quote>  AFFIRMED.</block_quote>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn5]</footnote_number> Stone was employed as a full charge bookkeeper, and by her forgeries she embezzled over $7,000 from her employer. The forgeries in the present case commenced while she was still on probation from a 1975 conviction on a plea of guilty to three counts of embezzlement. Those offenses also involved forgeries of an employer's checks. At that time over $78,000 of embezzled funds were traced to Stone's bank account.</footnote_body>
