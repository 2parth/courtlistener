<opinion_text>  Two teachers employed by the Anchorage School District appeal a superior court decision which dismissed, under Civil Rule 12(b)(6), their complaint against the School District for denial of a salary increase allegedly due them, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The teachers also appeal the award of attorney's fees to the School District by the superior court. We affirm the superior court on both issues.

The dispute centers on the salary provisions of two contractual agreements negotiated between the School District and the Anchorage Education Association, authorized collective bargaining representative for all teachers employed by the School District. These agreements covered consecutive periods of time. The first was negotiated to be in force from July 1, 1975, to June 30, 1977, and provided that a three percent "longevity pay" salary increase would be provided to each teacher upon completion of fifteen full years of service with the District. The second agreement was negotiated in June, 1977, to be in effect from July 1, 1977, to June 30, 1979. This second agreement terminated provisions for longevity pay for all teachers except those who had completed fifteen years of service in the District prior to the 1976-77 school term, but provided for an overall salary increase for all teachers. The two teachers in this appeal both completed fifteen years of employment with the District at the end of the 1976-77 school term. Thus, the second contract, negotiated subsequent to the time these teachers had completed the service which would entitle them to a salary increase under the first agreement, eliminated that right to an increase as part of a negotiation for salary increases for all teachers represented by the union.

The teachers' argument on appeal is that the provision in the first contract for longevity pay increases became a vested right upon completion of the specified term of service and therefore could not be bargained away in subsequent contractual negotiations between the District and the teachers' Union. We disagree.

The teachers do not dispute that the Anchorage Education Association was authorized to act as their bargaining agent in the 1977 contract negotiations, and the scope of bargaining power delegated to the teachers' union is not limited by the terms of either agreement. This court has held previously that the salary of teachers is a proper subject of collective bargaining under Alaska's statutes. <italic>Kenai Peninsula Borough School District v.</italic><italic>Kenai Peninsula Education Assoc.</italic>, <cross_reference>572 P.2d 416</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>422</cross_reference> (Alaska 1977).<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The<page_number>Page 265</page_number>
longevity pay provision in the 1975-77 agreement was but one component of the basic salary schedule for teachers contained in that contract. In fact, longevity pay was reduced in the 1975-77 agreement to three per cent from a five per cent rate specified in a previous contract. The complaining teachers, along with all other teachers in the district, received for the 1977-78 school year an overall raise in salary under the new agreement for 1977-79 greater than what teachers received for the 1976-77 year under the old agreement.

Authority in other jurisdictions supports the conclusion that privileges bargained for in agreements between an employer and a labor union may be subsequently given up in negotiations for a new contract, even for such items as seniority rights for which certain employees have already completed the performance which entitled them to the privilege under the old contract.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> As stated in <italic>International Longshoremen's  Warehousemen's Union v.</italic><italic>Kuntz</italic>, <cross_reference>334 F.2d 165</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>171</cross_reference> (9th Cir. 1964):

<block_quote>    The settlement of a labor dispute, whether accomplished by amendment of the contract or by resort to an already existing contract provision, may affect rights which in other fields are regarded as vested and in a manner which would be deemed "ex post facto." But where the power to bargain is not limited by the contract and since "[c]ompromises on a temporary basis, with a view to long range advantages, are natural incidents of negotiation", [<italic>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman</italic>, <cross_reference>345 U.S. at 338</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>73 S.Ct. at 686</cross_reference>] we believe that when "vested rights" are impaired or extinguished in the course of the bargaining, any recourse by the person affected must then depend upon "a bad faith motive, an intent to hostilely discriminate" on the part of the bargaining representative.</block_quote>

No bad faith or discriminatory intent has been alleged against the union in this case. In <italic>Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman</italic>,<cross_reference>345 U.S. 330</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>73 S.Ct. 681</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97 L.Ed. 1048</cross_reference> (1953), cited in the above case, the United States Supreme Court held that accrued seniority rights were within the scope of bargaining authority delegated to union representation under a federal statute, observing:

<block_quote>  Inevitably differences arise in the manner and degree to which the terms of any negotiated agreement affect individual employees and classes of employees. The mere existence of such differences does not make them invalid. The complete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly to be expected. A wide range of reasonableness must be allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents, subject always to complete good faith and honesty of purpose in the exercise of its discretion.</block_quote>

<cross_reference>345 U.S. at 338</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>73 S.Ct. at 686</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>97 L.Ed. at 1058</cross_reference>.

The cases relied upon by the teachers in their argument do not support their position to any great degree. These cases for the most part concern removal of accrued contract rights unilaterally by an employer rather than renegotiation of rights through<page_number>Page 266</page_number>
the collective bargaining process.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Some of these cases explicitly recognize that "vesting" of salary rights does not prohibit their alteration through later contractual agreement.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> The single case cited which has held against alteration of accrued rights by subsequent agreement between union and employer, <italic>Kolcum v. Board of Education of Woodbridge</italic><italic>School District</italic>, <cross_reference>335 A.2d 618</cross_reference> (Del.Super. 1975), is distinguishable from this case in that it concerned a situation where teachers had actually accepted a contract and expended their own money in reliance upon a contractual agreement with the school district. The term in these teachers' employment contracts which the court held it was improper to alter by subsequent negotiation with the union was the district's promise to pay the third of three yearly installments for reimbursement for moving expenses incurred when the teachers began employment. <italic>Id.</italic> at 623.

Since we conclude that the change in these teachers' salaries brought about by the contract renegotiation in this case did not abuse any "vested" rights entitled to judicial protection, we believe the superior court's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted was proper. Our disposition of this issue renders it unnecessary to consider the District's assertions that the teachers failed to exhaust available administrative remedies prior to bringing this lawsuit, and that judicial review of this dispute should be limited because it is subject to a contractual requirement of arbitration.

Regarding attorney's fees, we cannot agree with the teachers that the superior court abused its discretion in awarding<page_number>Page 267</page_number>
the amount of attorney's fees which it did to the School District. In our opinion, the teachers do not meet the criteria for the "public interest" exception to the normal rule permitting the discretionary award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party under Civil Rule 82(a).<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> <italic>Gilbert v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>526 P.2d 1131</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>1136</cross_reference> (Alaska 1974). At stake in this case were the rights of a few individuals to monetary benefits. These are not the type of interests which present a question of genuine public interest, litigation of which would be unduly discouraged by an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Since only about one-half of the attorney's fees requested by the District were awarded by the superior court in this case,<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> it is distinguishable from <italic>Malvo v. J.C. Penney Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>512 P.2d 575</cross_reference>
(Alaska 1973) which held that an award of all attorney's fees requested by the prevailing party, including those incurred in pursuing unsuccessful claims, was an abuse of discretion in a case with public interest aspects. <italic>Id.</italic> at 587-88. <italic>See also</italic><italic>Juneau Education Ass'n v. City  Borough of Juneau</italic>,<cross_reference>539 P.2d 704</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>708-09</cross_reference> (Alaska 1975).

This case can also be distinguished from <italic>Crisp v. Kenai</italic><italic>Peninsula Borough School District</italic>, <cross_reference>587 P.2d 1168</cross_reference> (Alaska 1978), in which this court held it to be an abuse of discretion to award<italic>any</italic> attorney's fees against a tenured teacher who appealed his dismissal from employment. That opinion emphasized that a tenured teacher has a statutorily guaranteed right to contest his dismissal in the courts, and noted that if a lesser interest than continued employment were at stake an award of attorney's fees might be justified. <italic>Id.</italic> at 1170 n. 7. Salary benefits are not specifically protected by a statutory right to judicial review, and the three percent increase in salary sought here does not compare with the right to employment itself.
