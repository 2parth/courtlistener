<opinion_text>  In this case, a father appeals the termination of his parental rights. His sole argument is that the Office of Children's Services (OCS) did not make sufficient active efforts to reunite him with his son. (The father does not appeal the trial court's findings of clear and convincing evidence of abandonment, addiction, or harm to the child.)

We review factual findings in cases concerning termination of parental rights for clear error.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

After a careful review of the parties' briefs and arguments, we conclude that the superior court's finding that OCS made active efforts to reunite the father with his son is not clearly erroneous. Moreover, the court's Decision eloquently sets out the case before the court and the reasons why the court decided the case as it did. We adopt the Decision in its entirety.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>

<center>                                <underline>DECISION</underline></center><underline>Summary</underline>

Gary M. was born in February of 2000 and placed in a foster home in Kenny Lake immediately after his birth. He remains there today and considers himself a member of that family. The foster parents wish to adopt him.

Gary's father, Monty H., has a twenty-five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse and serious crime. Since Gary's birth he started and failed treatment and relapsed several times. But, after those false starts, he participated in and successfully completed a rigorous addiction treatment program. He graduated two months ago. Monty now stands the best chance he's ever had of turning his life around. But even with his wonderful success he remains at significant risk for relapse and won't be safe or ready for placement of a small child in his home for at least another year.

Although recognizing and commending Monty's success, the state seeks to terminate his parental rights to Gary. Based on the evidence, I grant that petition.

My decision reflects the policy of Alaska's child in need of aid law that it is harmful to put a very young child's life on hold for six years to wait for a parent with a serious drug addiction to become a safe parent.

<underline>Legal Standard for Termination of Parental Rights</underline>

Gary M. is an Indian child. To terminate Monty H.'s rights the court must make several findings. The court must find by clear and convincing evidence that the child is at the time of trial in need of aid as defined by AS <cross_reference>47.10.011</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> In the alternative, if the child is no longer in need of aid at the time of trial, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that 1) the child was in need of aid, 2) the parent failed to remedy those conditions within a reasonable time, and 3) because of that failure, returning the child to the parent would place the child at substantial risk of mental or physical injury.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> The court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the department has made active but unsuccessful efforts to prevent the breakup of the family and that termination of parental rights is in the child's best interests.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>
Finally, the court must find by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including expert testimony, that continued parental custody is likely to cause serious emotional or physical damage to the child.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

The state alleges that Gary is a child in need of aid because of substance abuse<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> and abandonment.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Substance abuse renders a child in need of aid when the "ability to parent has been substantially impaired by the addictive or habitual use of an intoxicant . . . [resulting] in a substantial risk of harm to the child."<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> Abandonment is defined broadly and includes the failure "to participate in a suitable plan or program designed to reunite the parent . . . with the child."<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>

In determining whether a parent remedied dangerous conditions within a reasonable time the court may consider "the child's age or needs."<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> The court must also consider the policy behind the CINA requirement that, absent compelling reasons, the state must file a termination petition when a child has been in foster care fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference> Finally, in a case involving a young child like Gary, the court must analyze the CINA statute in light of the legislative finding that

<block_quote>  [C]hildren undergo a critical attachment process before the time they reach six years of age; . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  a child who has not attached with an adult caregiver during this critical stage will suffer significant emotional damage</block_quote>

<block_quote>  . . . and . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  it is important to provide for an expedited placement procedure to insure that all children, especially those under the age of six years, who have been removed from their homes are placed in permanent homes expeditiously.<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference></block_quote>

<underline>Facts</underline><footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference>

Gary M. was born on February 15, 2000. His mother, Donna M., was a cocaine user and OCS immediately removed Gary from her custody. Donna named D.G. as the father. Both are members of the Native Village of Tetlin Indian tribe. They asked the state to place Gary in the Davis foster home in Kenny Lake. D.G. knows the Davises. Mr. Davis worked for the Tetlin tribal government. Because of the Davises' success in raising other Alaska Native foster children, the tribe agreed with the placement although the Davises are Caucasian and not tribal members.<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference>

Approximately nine months later, in late November of 2000, Monty H. learned he might be Gary's father. Monty had a brief relationship with Donna while in a treatment program. Monty is African-American and a friend had seen Gary and mentioned that the child had African-American features.

Monty called OCS, but because he was incarcerated, OCS was unable to locate and contact him immediately. In February of 2001 OCS followed up with Monty by letter. But shortly afterwards, Monty was incarcerated again for a serious domestic violence assault.

In May of 2001 a social worker visited Monty in a halfway house and scheduled a paternity test. The worker also discussed an informal case plan with Monty that included substance abuse treatment and anger management treatment. At the same time Mr. Davis took Gary to the halfway house and it became apparent that the child resembled Monty.

Although incarcerated and not participating in treatment, Monty asked the state to remove Gary from the Davis home and place him in an Anchorage foster home so that Monty could visit more easily. OCS declined this request because Monty's paternity had not been clearly established, Gary was thriving in the Davis home, and Monty's prospects for rehabilitation were grim. He was forty-two years old and had been using drugs and alcohol and committing crimes since he was a teenager. His extensive record included several domestic violence crimes. He had participated but failed in treatment in the past.

Monty's paternity of Gary was established conclusively in July of [2001]. Monty remained incarcerated at the halfway house serving time on the domestic violence assault conviction. He was released in September of 2001 and began substance abuse treatment at R.I.T.E. A month later he traveled to Sacramento to visit his family. But during that visit he was arrested and jailed on outstanding California warrants.

Monty returned to Anchorage in early 2002 and resumed treatment at R.I.T.E. Because Gary was two years old and strongly bonded to the Davis family, OCS continued with the placement. The Davises brought Gary into Anchorage approximately once a month to visit Monty. The arrangements were made between Monty and the Davises without active OCS involvement.

In May of 2002 Monty left the R.I.T.E. program against treatment advice and went on a five-month cocaine binge. His lawyer could not find him. Of course, the visits with Gary ceased.

Monty re-entered R.I.T.E. in October but left against treatment advice in December. He was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) on January 3, 2003 and again in April 2003. Visits between Gary and Monty were infrequent during this time.

The April DWI was a felony, and because of Monty's prior record he faced a three-year jail term. In June of 2003 Monty was accepted into the Anchorage Felony DWI court and placed in the Akeela House drug treatment program. Monty was transferred from jail to a halfway house to participate in the program.

The first termination trial was held in June of 2003. Monty testified that he was in the Akeela House treatment program and expected to complete the program in six months.

The trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Gary was a child in need of aid because of abandonment and substance abuse. But the judge found that the state's evidence was not clear and convincing. The court found that the state had not made active efforts to re-unite Gary with his father because OCS did not actively participate in visitation scheduling and visits were inadequate. The judge also found beyond a reasonable doubt that adoption by the Davises was in Gary's best interests because of his strong bond with them and the lack of bond with Monty.

After the trial the state arranged for the Davises to bring Gary to town weekly and sometimes twice weekly. The majority of the visits were supervised but Monty sometimes took Gary off premises to a department store across the street and to the Boys and Girls Club.

Monty continued in the Akeela program and in September of 2003 he was released from the halfway house and moved into Oxford House, a supportive, independent living home run by recovering addicts. Children are not allowed to reside there but may visit overnight. Monty conceded at trial that he would not have been comfortable with an overnight visit because he did not know the background of the other residents.

Shortly after moving to Oxford House Monty resumed using cocaine and was incarcerated for two weeks. This relapse required him to restart the Akeela program from the beginning, delaying his progress by seven months.

Monty continued his weekly visits with Gary hoping to establish a bond with the child. The notes from the visitation supervisor reflect mixed success. Monty tried hard to establish a bond with Gary and at times the two were relaxed and had fun. But more often Gary did not engage with Monty. As time passed Gary became more and more reluctant to attend the visits, claiming a stomachache or other problems. Monty concedes that Gary does not recognize him as his father but as a stranger he has to visit.

The visitation supervisors also noticed that Monty had considerable difficulty with parenting skills. He was described as a passive parent, not able to understand the needs of a small child. He often sat and watched while Gary played. He focused on his own needs rather than the child's.

OCS recommended parenting classes for Monty and he completed two programs. But, at trial Monty described them as worthless.

Monty often complained that the visits were too short or too restrictive. He asked for unsupervised visits but OCS denied them because of Gary's unease and the likelihood of harm if Monty were to relapse.

Gary has been diagnosed with a speech development delay. He receives therapy in Kenny Lake from the school system. But the treatment also requires intensive and regular intervention by the Davises at home.

At trial, Dr. Susan LaGrande, a psychologist, testified that Monty's likelihood of relapse is high. The primary factor informing her opinion was that Monty had spent his entire adult life â twenty-five years â as a drug addict living a criminal lifestyle. She described this as a "life course and persistent" addiction. Monty failed to complete several treatment programs. Dr. LaGrande testified that she would not have confidence in his long-term sobriety until he demonstrated one year of living independently while remaining clean and sober. He had never done that during his adult life.

Dr. LaGrande also testified that Monty's likelihood of relapse would increase substantially if Gary were to live with him. Monty has never raised a child although he has two adult daughters. She testified that the deficiencies in Monty's parenting skills identified by the visitation observers would hamper his ability to cope with the ordinary rigors of child raising. Because of his passive parenting style, Monty would have difficulty in providing the at-home speech therapy Gary requires. Finally, she noted that parenting would be even more difficult because Gary would suffer serious psychological trauma if removed from the Davis home, the only family he knows.

The director of the Akeela program, Steven King testified on Monty's behalf. He noted that during the first seven months of the program and until his relapse Monty was treatment wise, manipulative, and not really engaged. But he also testified that after the relapse Monty participated meaningfully and completed the program. He described Monty's likelihood of relapse as low but guarded. But he conceded that he did not factor in the child rearing issues addressed by Dr. LaGrande and did not have the expertise to do so.

As mentioned above, Monty conceded at trial that he was a stranger to his son. Although he accepted some responsibility for this circumstance, he primarily cast blame on OCS, asserting that his visits were not adequate to establish a bond with his son. On cross-examination Monty admitted that he did not make much effort to try to establish contact with Gary in ways other than the scheduled visits. He did not ask to go to Kenny Lake to visit in a setting comfortable to the boy. Although he often brought presents to the OCS visits, Monty did not send Gary cards, letters, or birthday or Christmas presents.

Monty also made several statements demonstrating difficulty in distinguishing his own needs from those of a small child. He stated, "there is no Gary without me." He complained about the toys Gary chose to play with and stated, "Gary won't play with young child's toys when he is living with me." He was upset that Gary didn't choose to wear clothes that Monty purchased for him. And he stated that although he knew removal of Gary from the Davises would be difficult, "Gary would not miss them in six months." These statements led Dr. LaGrande to observe that Monty saw Gary as an object to satisfy Monty's needs rather than a child with his own needs. She suggested that Monty might benefit from psychological counseling to address these concerns.

<underline>Gary is a Child in Need of Aid Because of Monty's Addiction</underline>

When he uses drugs and alcohol Monty is dangerous. He assaults his domestic partners, he drives intoxicated, he lives with and associates with other drug users with dangerous behaviors. These facts were demonstrably true and proven by clear and convincing evidence when Monty was using drugs regularly.

I also find by clear and convincing evidence that Monty's ability to parent Gary remains substantially impaired today and that Gary would be at substantial risk of harm if he were living with Monty. Dr. LaGrande's opinion on this issue was credible and persuasive. It was based not only on sound research, but also borne out by the facts of this case. As noted above, Monty relapsed on cocaine while in treatment and within weeks of being released from the structured setting of a halfway house to the supportive but less structured Oxford House. He now lives on his own with even less support. Thus, he has not remedied the conduct that placed Gary at risk.<footnote_reference>[fn14]</footnote_reference>

As an alternative finding, I conclude by clear and convincing evidence that even if Mr. King's prognosis of a low likelihood of relapse is correct, Monty did not remedy the dangers associated with his addiction "within a reasonable time."<footnote_reference>[fn15]</footnote_reference> Monty concedes that he will not be able to actually parent Gary in his home for at least several more months. He also concedes that he has no real bond with Gary and is a stranger Gary is required to visit.

I also find that this circumstance was caused by Monty's failure to participate in a suitable treatment plan within a reasonable period of time after he discovered that he was Gary's father. Monty failed twice to participate in the R.I.T.E. program, leaving against treatment advice, and resuming his dangerous behavior. He started the Akeela program in June of 2003 but resumed using cocaine in November and had to start the program anew.

Gary spent his early childhood years with the Davises because of the length of time it took Monty to complete treatment. He bonded to the Davises and not to Monty because of the extended treatment period. Because of that delay, removal of Gary from the Davis home and placement in Monty's home in another year, at age six, would cause serious emotional damage to the child. Given Gary's age, Monty did not remedy the dangerous conditions associated with his addiction within a reasonable time.

<underline>Gary is a Child in Need of Aid Because of Abandonment â Failure</underline><underline>To Participate in a Suitable Treatment Program Within a</underline><underline>Reasonable Time</underline>

To prove abandonment the state must show that Monty failed to participate in a suitable treatment program. Since his re-entry into the Akeela program after his relapse in November 2003, Monty participated in a suitable program. Thus at the time of trial Gary was not a child in need of aid because of abandonment.

But, Monty did not participate in that program within a reasonable period of time. As discussed in detail above, because it took Monty so long to complete the program, Gary has bonded with the Davises. Removing Gary from that home would cause severe emotional damage.

<underline>The State Made Active Efforts To Re-Unite Gary with Monty</underline>

At the first termination trial the court found the state failed to make reasonable reunification efforts because OCS did not take an active part in arranging visits between Gary and Monty. OCS remedied that problem immediately after the trial. The Davises brought Gary to Anchorage once or twice a week from June 2003 until the date of the second trial (December 2004).

Monty claims that OCS should have moved Gary to a foster home in Anchorage so that he could have visited more often. I am not convinced that would have helped Monty bond with Gary. I am certain that it would have been harmful to the child.

The earliest feasible time for moving Gary from Kenny Lake to Anchorage was when he was two years old and Monty was finally released from jail and participating in the R.I.T.E. program. By then Gary was attached to the Davises. Given Monty's life course of drug use and crime, OCS did not act unreasonably in leaving the child in Kenny Lake and waiting to see how Monty fared.

In retrospect that decision was prescient. Monty left the R.I.T.E. program and disappeared for several months while using cocaine. He was arrested in California. He was arrested again in Anchorage for DUI twice. Had Gary lived in Anchorage he would have seen his father infrequently, probably not much more than he did when the Davises arranged visits prior to the first trial in June 2003.

In addition, Monty's inability to bond with Gary was caused in part by his difficulty with parenting skills. Even after Monty became somewhat more stable and OCS increased the visits, Monty remained unable to establish a meaningful relationship with Gary.

In sum, had OCS followed Monty's wishes, Gary's attachment to the Davises would have been disrupted. He would have been placed in a new foster home in Anchorage and likely formed an attachment to that family. If he formed any attachment to Monty, that bond would have been disrupted by Monty's continued relapses and incarcerations. The state would have done to Gary what the legislature sought to prohibit in AS <cross_reference>47.05.065</cross_reference>.

<underline>Placement with Monty Would Cause Serious Emotional Damage â</underline><underline>Termination of His Parental Rights Is in Gary's Best Interest</underline>

I find beyond a reasonable doubt, based on Dr. LaGrande's testimony, that return of Gary to Monty would cause serious emotional or physical damage. As noted above, I agree with Dr. LaGrande's opinions that Gary would suffer severe psychological trauma if forced to leave the family he recognizes as his own. The trauma would be exacerbated because of Monty's difficulty with parenting skills and his focus on his own needs rather than those of others. In addition, I agree that Gary is at significant risk for physical injury if placed with Monty because of the high risk of relapse.

I also find by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of Monty's parental rights and adoption by the Davises is in Gary's best interests. Gary is psychologically bonded to the Davis family. He considers Mr. and Mrs. Davis to be his parents. He considers the Davis children to be his sisters. He considers Kenny Lake to be his home. Removing him from that home would produce serious psychological damage.

The Davises testified that if they adopted Gary they would provide continued contact between Gary and Monty. They would also insure that Gary remained aware of his Alaska Native and African-American cultural ties. I find that they will follow through with this commitment.

Monty testified that if he were to retain his parental rights he would provide continued contact between Gary and the Davises. I find that Monty is not capable of keeping this promise. Monty's own need to establish his identity as Gary's father would make it difficult for him to allow anyone else into Gary's life who might challenge that role.

<underline>Conclusion</underline>

For the reasons stated above, the state's Second Petition for Termination of Parental Rights is GRANTED.
