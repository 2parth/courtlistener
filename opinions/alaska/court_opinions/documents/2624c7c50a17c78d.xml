<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  This is an appeal from a final judgment of the superior court in an action for divorce. The only issue on appeal concerns the trial court's division of the parties' property.

The judgment is affirmed.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Appellee is awarded her costs and $1,000 for her attorney's fees.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> In <italic>Schoning v. Schoning</italic>, <cross_reference>550 P.2d 373</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>374</cross_reference> (Alaska 1976), we observed:

<block_quote>    This court's prior decisions have firmly established the rule that the superior court is vested with broad discretion in such matters as award of alimony and property division, and that we will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion absent clear evidence of an unjust property division. (footnote omitted)</block_quote>

The record in this case is devoid of such evidence.</footnote_body>
