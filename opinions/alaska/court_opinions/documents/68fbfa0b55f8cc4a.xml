Administrative Rule 43.6 is revised as follows, including reorganizing the offenses to list them in the order of their new regulation numbers rather than their old regulation numbers:

Administrative Rule 43.6. Oversize Vehicle Bail Forfeiture Schedule.

Pursuant to AS <cross_reference>45.75.133</cross_reference>, the following offenses are appropriate for disposition without court appearance upon payment and forfeiture of the bail amounts listed. If a person charged with one of these offenses appears in court and is found guilty, the penalty imposed for the offense may not exceed the bail amount for that offense listed below. An offense for which a bail forfeiture amount has been established shall be charged on a citation which meets the requirements of District Court Criminal Rule 8(c) and shall not be filed, numbered or processed as a criminal case.
