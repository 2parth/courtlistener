<opinion_byline>  SINGLETON, Judge.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Peter Andrews, Sr., and George R. Koenig are school teachers. In unrelated prosecutions, each was convicted of multiple counts of sexual abuse and sexual assault on their elementary school female pupils. Andrews and Koenig are first offenders. Neither has a juvenile or adult criminal record. Andrews received concurrent sentences totaling eight years' imprisonment, and Koenig received consecutive sentences totaling forty years with twenty years suspended. Koenig's sentences were based in part on the trial court's conclusion that consecutive sentences were mandatory when a defendant is convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault involving different victims. AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e). Andrews' sentences were based in part on an opposite conclusion by the trial court in his case.

The primary issue in each appeal is the proper interpretation of AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g). On our own motion, we have therefore consolidated them for decision. In Andrews' case, the state contends that where an individual is convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault, he must receive consecutive sentences, at least where his sexual abuse involves separate victims. In contrast, Andrews argues that the legislature has expressed a preference for consecutive sentences but that the trial court has discretion to reject that preference in an appropriate case. Judge Lewis accepted Andrews' argument below and sentenced Andrews to concurrent terms. The state has petitioned for review and we consider the issue of sufficient importance to warrant our granting review.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> In Koenig's case, Judge Hanson was of the view that consecutive sentences were mandatory. He therefore gave Koenig consecutive sentences. Koenig appeals, contending that those sentences were excessive. We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g) express a preference for consecutive sentences which a trial court has discretion to reject in appropriate circumstances. We therefore affirm Andrews' sentences and vacate Koenig's sentences, remanding his case for resentencing. We also set out some guidelines to be applied to Koenig in resentencing. We set out the relevant facts regarding each of these two defendants and then proceed to a discussion of the issues.

<center>                                 ANDREWS</center>
Peter Andrews, Sr., was convicted of four counts of sexual abuse of a minor, a class C felony, former AS<cross_reference>11.41.440</cross_reference>(a)(2),<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> and seven counts of sexual assault in the first degree, an unclassified felony, former<page_number>Page 903</page_number>
AS <cross_reference>11.41.410</cross_reference>(a)(3).<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> Andrews was sentenced to five years for each count of sexual abuse and eight years (the presumptive term) for each count of first-degree sexual assault; all terms were imposed concurrently.

The charges against Andrews involved three victims: K.E. (age nine), L.K. (age ten) and D.M. (age ten). All the offenses took place between November 1, 1982, and June 21, 1983, mainly at the village school in Aleknagik, where Andrews worked as a teacher's aide. The only incident involving K.E. was one in which Andrews touched her breasts and vaginal area. L.K. was subjected to digital penetration on at least two occasions as well as less serious sexual contact similar to that suffered by K.E. In addition to less serious contact, D.M., the third victim, was subjected to digital and penile penetration of her anus, and digital, penile and oral penetration of her vagina. L.K. told police that the penile penetration hurt her and on at least one occasion made her bleed. Andrews' contact with D.M. was the most extensive. Andrews would take D.M. into the language lab, both during school and when school was not in session. Sometimes he would cover her mouth to keep her from yelling. On at least one occasion, Andrews enticed D.M. to his home and abused her. He also arranged for D.M. to work for him, so he could engage in sexual conduct more freely. Andrews apparently gave money or candy to his victims, but at no time threatened them with physical harm.

Andrews is a well-respected member of the Aleknagik community. He has served as mayor and, at the time of his arrest, was a member of the city council. In addition to his work as a teacher's aide at the school, Andrews has also served as a lay minister for the Moravian Church and has been employed as a fisherman. Andrews is in poor health. He has had multiple tumors removed from his bladder and will probably need ongoing medical treatment. Andrews was fifty-nine years of age at the time of sentencing. His formal education ended with the eighth grade. He is married and has thirteen children, six of whom continue to live with him. Andrews was honorably discharged from the United States Army.

Judge Lewis carefully considered the <italic>Chaney</italic> criteria. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Chaney</italic>, <cross_reference>477 P.2d 441</cross_reference> (Alaska 1970). He recognized the state's argument that consecutive sentences were mandatory under AS<cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g), but concluded that when read together with article I, section 12 of the Alaska Constitution,<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> and AS<cross_reference>12.55.005</cross_reference>,<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference> the statute permits imposition of<page_number>Page 904</page_number>
concurrent sentences under some circumstances. He concluded that while there was a statutory preference for consecutive sentences, the legislature has given trial courts discretion to reject that preference where necessary to serve the defendant's rehabilitation and the protection of the community. The court noted that in light of Andrews' age and poor health, a sentence in excess of eight years would be a virtual life sentence. The court therefore concluded that on the peculiar facts of this case, concurrent sentences requiring that Andrews serve no more than eight years' incarceration would fully satisfy all of the statutory requirements.

In reaching this conclusion, Judge Lewis did not minimize the significance of Andrews' offenses. He noted that Andrews, as a teacher and community leader, had the respect and confidence of his victims and, in effect, abused a trust in subjecting them to sexual abuse. He further noted that Andrews exhibited no remorse and that, despite the jury verdicts, Andrews refused to acknowledge any guilt or responsibility, characterizing his touching of the victims as normal activity between teacher and student. Finally, Judge Lewis recognized, in part based upon his observation of the demeanor of the victims as they testified, that they had all suffered substantial psychological injury and would probably require extensive counseling in the future in order to have any hope of a psychologically healthy adult life.

George R. Koenig was thirty-three years of age at the time of his offenses. He has a master's degree in philosophy and was the music and language teacher at a Wasilla grammar school. Koenig was initially charged with sixteen counts of sexual abuse and sexual assault involving eight victims: S.L.F. (age nine); K.L.M. (age nine); M.A.S. (age twelve); D.M.I. (age eight); J.L.S. (age nine); G.L.H. (age eleven); E.E. (age eight); and H.D.K. (age eight). As part of a plea agreement, Koenig entered a plea of<italic>nolo contendere</italic> to three charges, and the state dismissed the other thirteen with the understanding that it could bring out evidence regarding all sixteen offenses at sentencing. Koenig was therefore convicted of one count of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree, an unclassified felony, AS <cross_reference>11.41.434</cross_reference>(a)(1), based upon digital penetration of H.D.K., and two counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree, a class B felony, AS <cross_reference>11.41.436</cross_reference>(a)(2), based upon, respectively, the touching of K.L.M.'s vagina and the touching of E.E.'s breasts.<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> Koenig was sentenced to twenty years with ten suspended on the first-degree sexual abuse conviction, and ten years with five suspended on each of the second-degree sexual abuse convictions. All three sentences<page_number>Page 905</page_number>
were made consecutive, so that Koenig received a total sentence of forty years with twenty years suspended.

Judge Hanson considered a number of factors in framing the sentence as he did. First, he concluded the consecutive sentences were mandatory for sexual assaults involving separate victims under AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g). Second, he noted that Koenig had abused a position of trust since he was a school teacher and since all of the acts of sexual abuse occurred during school hours. Third, he recognized that Koenig's victims in the offenses to which he pled were particularly young, eight and nine years of age, and therefore vulnerable. <italic>See</italic> AS <cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(c)(5). Finally, he noted a report by Dr. Rothrock, a psychiatrist, that Koenig was a pedophile and that his prognosis for rehabilitation was guarded. These factors led Judge Hanson to conclude that Koenig's conduct was the worst contemplated within the definitions of the offenses charged. AS <cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(c)(10). Because two aggravating factors were found, Judge Hanson was not limited by the eight-year presumptive term prescribed for the single count of first-degree sexual abuse.

In Koenig's favor, Judge Hanson noted that Koenig's offenses involved sexual touching including digital penetration but no genital intercourse, that Koenig was a hard worker, that he was a well-educated, intelligent man, and that he had expressed a substantial amount of remorse and actively sought treatment in the hope it would cure his sexual predilection for small children.

<center>                               DISCUSSION</center><center>                                   I.</center>
The primary question presented by this appeal is the proper interpretation of AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g). The statute provides:

<block_quote>    (e) Except as provided in (g) of this section, if the defendant has been convicted of two or more crimes, sentences of imprisonment shall run consecutively. If the defendant is imprisoned upon a previous judgment of conviction for a crime, the judgment shall provide that the imprisonment commences at the expiration of the term imposed by the previous judgment.</block_quote>

<block_quote>            .      .      .      .      .</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (g) If the defendant has been convicted of two or more crimes before the judgment on either has been entered, any sentences of imprisonment may run concurrently if</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (1) the crimes violate similar societal interests;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (2) the crimes are part of a single, continuous criminal episode;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (3) there was not a substantial change in the objective of the criminal episode, including a change in the parties to the crime, the property or type of property right offended, or the persons offended;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (4) the crimes were not committed while the defendant attempted to escape or avoid detection or apprehension after the commission of another crime;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (5) the sentence is not for a violation of AS  <cross_reference>11.41.100</cross_reference>-<cross_reference>11.41.470</cross_reference>; or</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (6) the sentence is not for a violation of AS  <cross_reference>11.41.500</cross_reference>-<cross_reference>11.41.530</cross_reference> that results in physical injury or serious physical injury as those terms are defined in AS <cross_reference>11.81.900</cross_reference>.</block_quote>

Alaska Statute <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) requires consecutive sentences in all cases subject to exceptions defined in (g), which contains six subparagraphs. The first three subparagraphs, (1)-(3), identify three situations in which concurrent sentences have been traditionally imposed. <italic>Cf.</italic> former AS <cross_reference>12.55.145</cross_reference>(a)(3) (considering prior offenses committed under similar circumstances a single prior offense for purposes of presumptive sentencing). The problem arises because the last three subparagraphs, (4)-(6), are phrased in the negative and appear to describe situations in which the legislature may not have wished concurrent sentences, yet the drafter placed all six subparagraphs in the disjunctive. This grammatical structure suggests that each subparagraph should be considered an independent basis for permitting concurrent sentences. Read in this literal fashion, however, the<page_number>Page 906</page_number>
statute would permit imposition of concurrent sentences in almost every case, since the conduct need only satisfy one of the six subparagraphs, and three of them are in the negative. In<italic>Griffith v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>675 P.2d 662</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984), we accepted a stipulation of the parties, ignored the disjunctive "or", and construed the three final subparagraphs as exceptions to the exceptions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, as situations in which the general rule precluding concurrent sentences would apply. We noted, however, the ambiguity inherent in this awkward grammatical structure, thereby indicating that interpretational problems would have existed in the absence of the parties' stipulation.

<center>                                   A.</center>
Before construing AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(g) and considering the parties' arguments, it is necessary to reach a preliminary point. In the revisor's notes to AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>, it is stated:

<block_quote>    Alaska Statute <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) was amended by § 24, Ch. 143, SLA 1982 and purportedly repealed by § 42, Ch. 143, SLA 1982. The repeal in § 42 was apparently a drafting error. <italic>See</italic> House Journal Supplement No. 63, (dated June 1, 1982), page 18.</block_quote>

Andrews argues that the repeal, though perhaps an oversight, must be given full force and effect. He further argues that paragraph (e) governs paragraph (g), and that if (e) was repealed, (g) cannot have any force or effect.<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference> The state concedes that § 42 of Chapter 143, SLA 1982 states that AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) is repealed, and that section 24 of the same chapter repealed former AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e), which had previously governed imposition of concurrent or consecutive sentences, and enacted the present provisions in its place.

The state reasons, however, that the commentary to the bill which became Chapter 143 recognized that the purported repeal of AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) contained in § 42 was an error, since the commentary discusses only § 24 of the bill. Supp. No. 63 at 12 in 3 House Journal (1982), following p. 2356. The revisor picked up the error as we have seen. Consequently, the state concludes, since the alleged repeal was obviously an error, we should disregard it. We agree. As Sutherland points out, "designation of an act to be repealed will not effect a repeal of that act where, due to clerical mistake, the wrong act was named." 1A C. Sands,<italic>Sutherland Statutory Construction</italic> § 23.07, at 219-20 n. 5 (4th ed. 1972). We are satisfied that the legislature intended to repeal the existing AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and re-enact a new<cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e), and that the language used accomplished that purpose, though somewhat inartfully. We therefore reject Andrews' argument.

<center>                                   B.</center>
In <italic>Lacquement v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>644 P.2d 856</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1982), we charted the history of consecutive sentencing under former law. We noted that where a defendant was convicted of two or more crimes before the judgment on either had been entered, prior legislation as well as the law in effect at the time of Lacquement's sentencing permitted a trial court to impose sentences either concurrently or consecutively.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference> We<page_number>Page 907</page_number>
also noted, however, that neither the legislature nor the Alaska Supreme Court had ever established guidelines to assist trial judges in determining under what circumstances consecutive rather than concurrent sentences should be imposed. 644 P.2d at 861. In this case, the parties are in agreement that Chapter 143, SLA 1982 was intended in part to respond to this statutory void. The parties are also in agreement that the legislature clearly articulated a preference for consecutive sentences, subject to certain exceptions. They disagree, however, over the proper interpretation of those exceptions.

Ambiguities in criminal statutes must be narrowly read and construed strictly against the government. <italic>State v. Rice</italic>,<cross_reference>626 P.2d 104</cross_reference> (Alaska 1981); <italic>Kuvaas v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>696 P.2d 684</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1985); <italic>Conner v.

State</italic>, <cross_reference>627 P.2d 211</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>219</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1981); 3 C. Sands, <italic>Sutherland Statutory Construction</italic>, §§ 59.03, 59.04, 59.06 (4th ed. 1974). The foregoing rule applies equally to provisions governing sentencing and provisions defining crimes.<italic>See Kuvaas</italic>, 696 P.2d at 685; <italic>Rastopsoff</italic>, 659 P.2d at 640;<italic>see also Bifulco v. United States</italic>, <cross_reference>447 U.S. 381</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>100 S.Ct. 2247</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>65 L.Ed.2d 205</cross_reference> (1980). Closely allied to the doctrine that criminal statutes must be strictly construed is the so-called rule of lenity. If a statute establishing a penalty is susceptible of more than one meaning, it should be construed so as to provide the most lenient penalty. <italic>See, e.g., Brookins v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>600 P.2d 12</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>17</cross_reference> (Alaska 1979).

As stated above, in <italic>Griffith v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>675 P.2d 662</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984), it was unnecessary for us to finally interpret AS<cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(g) because the parties reached an agreement as to its meaning which was fully dispositive of Griffith's case. We set out the statute and then concluded as follows:

<block_quote>    The statute is not well drafted and there are a number of possible interpretations of the statutory language. Fortunately, the state and Griffith agree on an interpretation of the statute. They agree that if a defendant's conduct falls within subparagraphs (4) [the crimes were not committed while the defendant attempted to escape or avoid detection or apprehension after the commission of another crime], (5) [the sentence is not for a violation of AS  <cross_reference>11.41.100</cross_reference>-<cross_reference>11.41.470</cross_reference>] or (6) [the sentence is not for a violation of AS <cross_reference>11.41.500</cross_reference>-<cross_reference>11.41.530</cross_reference> that results in physical injury or serious physical injury as those terms are defined in AS <cross_reference>11.81.900</cross_reference>], the court may not impose a concurrent sentence. However, if the defendant's conduct falls within subparagraphs (1), (2) or (3), the court is authorized to impose concurrent sentences.</block_quote>

675 P.2d at 664. The parties' agreement was dispositive of Griffith's case. They agreed that the trial court had not correctly interpreted the statute and did not understand that it could have given Griffith a concurrent sentence, because Griffith's conduct did not fall within subparagraphs (4), (5), or (6), but it did fall within subparagraph (1). We accepted the agreement of the parties and remanded Griffith's case for resentencing.

The <italic>Griffith</italic> interpretation does not help Andrews and Koenig, however, because they were convicted of sexual offenses governed by subparagraph (g)(5). Consequently, it is necessary for us to consider in this case whether the legislature has absolutely<page_number>Page 908</page_number>
ruled out concurrent sentences for those convicted of such offenses.

Andrews argues that the various subparagraphs of (g) are tied together by semicolons except that the word "or" separates (5) from (6). He reasons that where words are placed in a series and the final two words in the series are separated by an "or," all of the paragraphs are disjunctive unless legislative intent is clearly contrary or such a construction is repugnant to the act in question. <italic>United States v. Garcia</italic>, <cross_reference>718 F.2d 1528</cross_reference> (11th Cir. 1983), <italic>aff'd</italic>, ___ U.S. ___, <cross_reference>105 S.Ct. 479</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>83 L.Ed.2d 472</cross_reference>
(1984); <italic>George Hyman Construction Co. v. Occupational Safety and</italic><italic>Health Review Commission</italic>, <cross_reference>582 F.2d 834</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>839-40</cross_reference> (4th Cir. 1978);<italic>Azure v. Morton</italic>, <cross_reference>514 F.2d 897</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>900</cross_reference> (9th Cir. 1975); 1A C. Sands, <italic>Sutherland Statutory Construction</italic> § 21.14 (4th ed. 1972). Under this interpretation, Andrews argues, if a case arguably falls within any of the subparagraphs, concurrent sentences are presumptively appropriate, though not mandatory. While Andrews and Koenig were convicted of sexual assaults and therefore cannot benefit from the paragraph that makes concurrent sentences available to those who are not convicted of such offenses, their crimes involved similar societal interests, subparagraph (g)(1), were not committed while escaping, subparagraph (g)(4), and did not involve the circumstances set forth in subparagraph (g)(6). Consequently, according to Andrews' view, the trial courts were authorized to consider concurrent sentences in determining appropriate sentences for Andrews and, by extension, Koenig.

We agree that this is one possible reading of the statute. The interpretation discussed in <italic>Griffith</italic> is also a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Where a statute is susceptible of two or more conflicting but reasonable meanings it is ambiguous. We resolve the ambiguity by adopting the meaning most favorable to the defendant, and accept Andrews' interpretation of the statute. Treating the various sub-categories under paragraph (g) as disjunctive does not obviously violate legislative intent and is not repugnant to the statute. We therefore affirm Judge Lewis' conclusion that he had limited discretion to give Andrews concurrent sentences despite Andrews' conviction of multiple sexual assaults.<footnote_reference>[fn9]</footnote_reference> For the same reason, we reverse Judge Hanson's conclusion that he was obligated to give consecutive sentences to Koenig. We realize that Judge Hanson recognized that Koenig's sexual contact convictions were not presumptive and thus could have resulted in suspended sentences, even though he believed those sentences would have had to have been consecutive. Judge Hanson nevertheless declined to suspend additional time. We do not view Judge Hanson's consideration of this issue as establishing that any error he made in concluding that consecutive sentences were mandatory was harmless. We believe that Koenig should have an opportunity on remand to argue for concurrent sentences. We therefore vacate his sentences and remand for resentencing.

Our decision to accept Andrews' interpretation of AS<cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(g) is reinforced by three considerations. First, the legislature intended that the revised code create reasonable uniformity and eliminate unjustified disparity in sentences; it therefore established a somewhat rigid sentencing framework. AS<cross_reference>12.55.005</cross_reference>. If consecutive sentences were automatic in cases involving sexual assaults on minors, it would appear that the legislative goal of uniformity would be achieved. However, this uniformity would be illusory. Most incest cases involve a protracted sexual relationship between abuser and victim; typically, the victim testifies to many incidents, but has great difficulty differentiating between incidents. <italic>See Covington v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>703 P.2d 436</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1985). Generally, if<page_number>Page 909</page_number>
the state can prove one incident it can prove them all, since the same evidence will be before the jury and the result will turn on whether the jury believes the victim or not. The state is therefore able in almost all these cases to arbitrarily decide between charging multiple incidents or a single incident. Consider the cases of two identically situated individuals, the evidence against each of whom would support a finding of ten separate incidents of first-degree sexual assault. If the state's interpretation of the statute were correct, one person might be charged with and convicted of one offense and automatically receive an eight-year presumptive term, while the other was charged with and convicted of ten incidents, and therefore automatically sentenced to ten consecutive eight-year presumptive terms. Again, this would be true even though the evidence in both cases was identical. It is only if the statute permits concurrent sentences and is interpreted to impose reasonable restrictions on consecutive sentences that the statutory goal found in AS<cross_reference>12.55.005</cross_reference> — that those whose criminal conduct is roughly identical should receive substantially similar sentences — can be attained.

Closely related is a second concern. Under the state's interpretation of the statute, where the evidence will permit single or multiple charges at the prosecutor's absolute discretion, a defendant is under substantial pressure to accept an offer to plead to a single count regardless of guilt. We recognize that this pressure will exist to a degree in any case in which the state may elect to charge fewer offenses, or a lesser-included offense in preference to a greater offense. Where consecutive sentences are mandatory, however, this pressure could become virtually insurmountable. Clearly the legislature did not wish to encourage the conviction of the innocent.

Finally, our conclusion that the statute establishes a preference for consecutive sentences in the case of crimes of sexual assault but does not make such sentences mandatory is consistent with the treatment given consecutive sentences in<italic>Fair and Certain Punishment, Report of The Twentieth Century</italic><italic>Fund Task Force on Criminal Sentencing</italic> (1976), which was the source from which the Alaska Criminal Law Revision Subcommission derived presumptive sentencing. <italic>See</italic> Alaska Revised Criminal Code, Part VI, at 9 (Tentative Draft 1978) (hereafter T.D.). The authors of <italic>Fair and Certain Punishment</italic> concluded:

<block_quote>  <italic>Concurrent Versus Consecutive Sentences</italic></block_quote>

<block_quote>    As observed in the text of the Task Force report, difficulties arise under presumptive sentencing in dealing with several offenses that grow out of the same or a connected transaction or that are closely related in time. Our proposal by no means creates this issue, but rather forces it to the surface because it is no longer hidden by the discretionary employment of concurrent sentences. We believe that several different approaches or principles are required in coping with this very difficult problem.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    The first principle is that a single criminal transaction cannot be broken down into separate crimes for purposes of imposing consecutive sentences, nor can the sentence for such a transaction exceed the sentence for the single most serious crime. Thus, a defendant convicted for a single armed robbery cannot receive consecutive sentences for such component crimes as possession of a weapon, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, larceny, and trespassing; his maximum exposure would be for the sentence (presumptive plus the increment, except in extraordinary cases) prescribed for armed robbery (or whatever the single most serious crime was).</block_quote>

<block_quote>    The second principle is that a series of unrelated criminal acts or transactions can be punished by consecutive sentences, as in the example of four armed robberies carried out over the period of one week. We are aware that, although this is permitted under current law, it is not generally done today and could result in unrealistically long sentences. But we see no reasonable alternative other than<page_number>Page 910</page_number>
to devise a sophisticated system in which every additional crime in a series carries an increment of punishment, but not the full increment of a consecutive sentence. And perhaps this may prove to be the best solution.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    The third principle is that a continuing crime or a series of closely run crimes should also be punished by an incremental sentencing. The example used is that of a government official who submits a single fraudulent bill versus an official who has submitted a hundred fraudulent bills over a two-year period. It would be unconscionable to punish the latter a hundred times more harshly than the former. Some legislative formula making the latter practice a  <italic>different</italic> and more serious crime with gradually increasing penalties for each new violation makes more sense than adding an entire consecutive sentence for every fraudulent bill.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    A top limit could be imposed, of course, on consecutive offenses for a particular type of crime. For example, no one convicted of larceny, regardless of how many transactions were involved, could receive a sentence in excess of ten years. Or no sentence in excess of a given maximum (say, 25 years) could be imposed regardless of the type or number of crimes charged. However, this raises the related problem of whether the government must try a defendant at the same time for <italic>all</italic> crimes it intends to charge him with. The Task Force takes no position on this, except as it relates to sentencing.</block_quote>

<italic>Fair and Certain Punishment, supra</italic> at 49-50 (appendix A).

As originally enacted, AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) established a preference for concurrent sentences, in reliance on ABA <italic>Standards on</italic><italic>Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures</italic> § 3.4(b)(10) (Approved Draft 1971). T.D. Part VI, at 25-26. We recognize that the legislature reversed this preference when it amended subparagraph (e) and added .025(g). We do not believe, however, that the legislature intended thereby to mandate the "unconscionable" result mentioned by the authors of <italic>Fair and Certain Punishment.</italic>
A person who commits ten sexual assaults should, consistent with the guidelines established in AS <cross_reference>12.55.005</cross_reference>, receive a more severe sentence than a person convicted of a single incident, but he should not be punished ten times as severely. <italic>See Sherman v.</italic><italic>Holiday Construction Company</italic>, <cross_reference>435 P.2d 16</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>19</cross_reference> (Alaska 1967) (statutes should be construed to avoid glaringly absurd results seemingly compelled by their literal terms).<footnote_reference>[fn10]</footnote_reference><page_number>Page 911</page_number>

Koenig's appellate briefing was directed at establishing that his individual sentences were excessive. Since this issue will arise on remand and would be particularly significant if Judge Hanson should again determine that consecutive sentences were appropriate, we address a few remarks to his case. First of all, we agree with Judge Hanson that Koenig's case was, to a certain extent, aggravated. As Judge Hanson pointed out, the victims in this case were eight and nine years of age. <italic>See</italic> AS<cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(c)(5) (the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to extreme youth). While the elements of AS <cross_reference>11.41.434</cross_reference>(a)(1) and AS <cross_reference>11.41.436</cross_reference>(a)(2) require age disparity between victim and assailant, we agree with Judge Hanson that the extreme youth of these children meets the test for the aggravating factor. By the same token, Koenig's status as a public school teacher, and the position of authority it gave him over his victims, serves to aggravate this case. <italic>See Goulden</italic><italic>v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>656 P.2d 1218</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1222</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1983); <italic>see also</italic>
former AS <cross_reference>11.41.410</cross_reference>(a)(4)(A). Finally, Koenig was convicted of offenses involving multiple victims, and the trial court also properly considered, pursuant to the plea agreement reached between the parties, uncharged offenses verified in the record. Taking all of these factors together, we conclude that Koenig was properly given an aggravated sentence.

In reaching this conclusion, we stress, however, that proof of aggravating factors by clear and convincing evidence, while a necessary condition for an aggravated sentence, is not sufficient for that purpose. Ultimately the trial court must consider the totality of the defendant's conduct in the light of his past record and future prospects in determining an appropriate sentence. In this regard, the overwhelming majority of cases involving sexual abuse of minors that we have reviewed, regardless of whether that abuse takes the form of sexual contact or sexual penetration, have involved people in positions of authority over the minor, <italic>e.g.</italic>, teachers, parents, babysitters,<italic>et cetera</italic>, and children of extreme youth. While this case is aggravated, it is not sufficiently aggravated to warrant a maximum sentence or sentences.

In order to resolve Koenig's claim that his sentence is excessive we must compare it with sentences imposed in cases involving similar offenses. <italic>Pears v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>698 P.2d 1198</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1202</cross_reference>
(Alaska, 1985); <italic>Page v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>657 P.2d 850</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>854-55</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1983).

We will therefore consider other cases discussing appropriate sentences for sexual assault in order to determine an appropriate range of sentences for someone like Koenig. We have considered sentences for sexual assault in connection with a number of recent cases. <italic>See, e.g., State v. Brinkley</italic>, <cross_reference>681 P.2d 351</cross_reference>
(Alaska App. 1984); <italic>State v. Woods</italic>, <cross_reference>680 P.2d 1195</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984); <italic>State v. Morris</italic>, <cross_reference>680 P.2d 1190</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984);<italic>State v. Couey</italic>, <cross_reference>680 P.2d 513</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984); <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Rushing</italic>, <cross_reference>680 P.2d 500</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984); and <italic>Langton v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>662 P.2d 954</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1983). These cases arose prior to the effective date of legislation establishing presumptive sentences for first offenders convicted of sexual offenses against children. Nevertheless, we consider them of some value in establishing a context for a discussion of sexual-offender sentencing under existing law. In those cases we were asked to decide in part whether certain sentences imposed upon those convicted of sexual assaults on children were too lenient. We canvassed sentences previously imposed and concluded that sentences for rape including what would be sexual assaults on children under current law were "roughly divided" into three categories:

<block_quote>    (1) The most mitigated cases usually justifying a sentence from ninety days to three years;</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (2) typical conduct which should ordinarily result in a sentence of from three years to six years;</block_quote><page_number>Page 912</page_number>

<block_quote>    (3) aggravated conduct which may justify a sentence of from six years to the prior maximum of twenty years.</block_quote>

<italic>State v. Brinkley</italic>, 681 P.2d at 356. In a footnote we stated:

<block_quote>    A first offender who receives a sentence of six years or greater under former law should have engaged in conduct which approaches use of a dangerous weapon or causes serious physical injury to the victim. Where the sentence exceeds ten years, a substantially more aggravated case is required. [Citations omitted.]</block_quote>

681 P.2d at 356 n. 3. Since most of the cases we were discussing involved a state claim that the sentence imposed was too lenient rather than a claim by the defendant that the sentence was excessive, it was not necessary for us to discuss those cases in which a sentence in excess of ten years was appropriate.

In <italic>Atkinson v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>699 P.2d 881</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1985), we considered a sentence of ten years with four years suspended. Atkinson was sentenced on a single count of sexual assault in the first degree. The victim was Atkinson's daughter. The parties agreed that the court could consider the total sexual relationship between Atkinson and the victim. The trial court found that Atkinson began abusing the victim when she was seven years old and continued for two years until she was nine, at which time the abuse was discovered. The victim vigorously resisted the assaults and was beaten and tied up to facilitate the sexual abuse. The abuse consisted of multiple incidents of both sexual contact and sexual penetration. Atkinson appealed his sentence contending it was excessive. We affirmed.

In <italic>Depp v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>686 P.2d 712</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>720-21</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984), we dealt with a case having facts even more similar to those presented by the cases of Andrews and Koenig. There the fifty-one-year-old principal of a school was convicted of three counts of first-degree sexual assault and three counts of sexual abuse, all involving the eleven-year-old son of a friend. The record established a continuous course of sexual abuse of children other than the victim charged in the indictment. 686 P.2d at 721. We approved three concurrent sentences of fifteen years with seven years suspended.

In neither case did the state cross-appeal, arguing that the sentence was too lenient; our affirmances do not, therefore, indicate whether more severe sentences for Atkinson or Depp would have been excessive. Nevertheless, given the sentencing courts' careful consideration of the respective backgrounds of Atkinson and Depp, the conduct constituting their offenses and the aggravating and mitigating factors which are typically found in cases of sexual assaults on small children, <italic>Atkinson</italic> and <italic>Depp</italic>
may properly serve as benchmarks against which other sentences for sexual assault on children should be measured. Unless a defendant's conduct was substantially more serious than Atkinson's and Depp's, a sentence in excess of fifteen years would appear, on its face at least, clearly mistaken. Obviously, a benchmark sentence can only be a guide, not a rule. <italic>Page v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>657 P.2d 850</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>855</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1983).

In this regard we recognize that Atkinson pled to a single count of first-degree sexual assault, while others (such as Depp) who have also engaged in a continuous course of sexual abuse of a minor may be convicted of multiple counts, theoretically permitting consecutive sentences. While these distinctions may be significant, we do not believe the number of counts standing alone should be given overriding weight. Certainly the existence of multiple victims or multiple assaults on a single victim occurring during a protracted period is significant to the extent that it reflects a given defendant's potential future danger to society. Nevertheless, even in imposing a single sentence, the trial court should consider the totality of the defendant's conduct to the extent that it is verified in the record.<italic>Nukapigak v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>562 P.2d 697</cross_reference> (Alaska 1977), <italic>modified on</italic><italic>rehearing</italic>, <cross_reference>576 P.2d 982</cross_reference> (Alaska 1978).<page_number>Page 913</page_number>
In imposing such a sentence the court should consider the defendant's history of violent or sexually-abusive behavior with the victim named in the indictment, as well as similar conduct directed at other victims that has been verified in the record. By the same token a trial judge simultaneously sentencing a defendant for multiple crimes should impose a composite sentence similarly reflecting the totality of the defendant's conduct. A sentence for one count which might, viewed in isolation, appear excessive (or, by extension, too lenient) may not be clearly mistaken when viewed as a component in a composite sentence. <italic>Waters v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>483 P.2d 199</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>201-02</cross_reference> (Alaska 1971). As we noted earlier, a person who is simultaneously sentenced for ten identical but separate criminal episodes should receive an incrementally greater sentence than one convicted of a single incident, but not ten times as great a sentence. <italic>Fair and Certain Punishment, supra</italic>, at 49-50. In determining an appropriate incremental increase the trial court should consider the totality of the defendant's conduct in comparison with the totality of the conduct of other sentenced offenders discussed in the reported cases. We believe this approach particularly appropriate in sentencing sexual offenders whose victims are children. Aggravated cases warranting sentences beyond the three- to six-year mid-category established in <italic>Brinkley</italic> and the four to eight years established under presumptive sentencing,<footnote_reference>[fn11]</footnote_reference> will almost invariably involve multiple incidents and frequently multiple victims, whether or not there is actually a plea to multiple counts. <italic>See State v.</italic><italic>Brinkley</italic>, <cross_reference>681 P.2d 351</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>356</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984). In our view, any approach to the problem other than that discussed above would subordinate judicial sentencing discretion to prosecutorial charging discretion. While the revised code clearly sought to limit discretion by establishing presumptive sentencing, there is no indication that the legislature preferred one form of discretion to the other.

The Alaska Supreme Court and this court have considered a number of sexual assault sentences. We believe a review of those cases which address sexual assaults involving both adult and child victims supports a sentencing range for aggravated offenses of ten to fifteen years, and use of <italic>Atkinson</italic> and <italic>Depp</italic> as benchmarks for determining the kind of conduct warranting a sentence within that range. We believe these benchmarks are applicable to all aggravated cases, whether aggravation is found, because of: (1) multiple victims; (2) multiple assaults on a single victim; or (3) serious injuries to one or more victims. Of course, a trial court is not bound to sentence in accordance with a benchmark and should not do so in a truly extraordinary case. In almost every case, the sentence approved by the reviewing court was in the range of six to fifteen years.<footnote_reference>[fn12]</footnote_reference> These cases exhibit a variety of<page_number>Page 914</page_number>
circumstances which justify characterizing them as aggravated offenses. In many cases the victims suffered serious physical injury, in others there were multiple victims, or multiple attacks on a single victim. In some cases, the defendant had a substantial record of prior convictions for crimes of violence including, in many cases, prior convictions for sexual assault. Nevertheless, as the supreme court pointed out in <italic>Tuckfield v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>621 P.2d 1350</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1353</cross_reference> (Alaska 1981), the court had never, prior to <italic>Tuckfield</italic>, approved a maximum sentence for a person convicted of rape. At the time <italic>Tuckfield</italic>
was decided, twenty years was the maximum sentence.<footnote_reference>[fn13]</footnote_reference> The<page_number>Page 915</page_number>
court approved such a sentence for Tuckfield based primarily on his extensive criminal record, which included two prior nonviolent felonies, and the serious injury to his victim. Further, the court stressed Tuckfield's refusal to admit guilt and the poor prognosis for his rehabilitation. 621 P.2d at 1353-54.

In two cases we have approved sentences in the twenty-year range for sexual abuse of children. <italic>Seymore v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>655 P.2d 786</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1982); and <italic>Qualle v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>652 P.2d 481</cross_reference>
(Alaska App. 1982). In <italic>Seymore</italic>, we approved a twenty-year sentence with restricted parole for one count of first-degree sexual assault on the defendant's stepdaughter. At that time the crime was a class A felony. Seymore was thirty-nine years old. The record reflected a continuous course of sexual abuse, including a prior conviction for sexual abuse of the same stepdaughter, for which Seymore had received a suspended imposition of sentence. His victim suffered substantial psychological damage. 655 P.2d at 786. In <italic>Qualle</italic>, we considered a forty-year composite of consecutive sentences for one count of statutory rape and one count of lewd and lascivious acts with a child involving, respectively, a seven-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy; we held the sentence excessive and directed that it be reduced on remand to no more than twenty-one years. 652 P.2d at 488. Qualle, a mature man fifty-one years old, had a long history of child sexual abuse with commercial overtones, and there was evidence that Qualle had previously engaged in sexual relations with his daughters. <italic>Id.</italic> at 484, 487.

The supreme court's treatment of <italic>Tuckfield</italic> and our treatment of <italic>Seymore</italic> and <italic>Qualle</italic> was consistent with the general rule that maximum sentences should only be imposed upon worst offenders. <italic>See State v. Wortham</italic>, <cross_reference>537 P.2d 1117</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1120</cross_reference> (Alaska 1975). The "worst offender" designation may be based on the particular manner of committing the offense, the background of the offender or both. <italic>Saganna v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>594 P.2d 69</cross_reference> (Alaska 1979).

Generally, the supreme court has based a worst offender characterization on an extensive criminal record. <italic>See, e.g.,</italic><italic>Tuckfield v. State</italic>, 621 P.2d at 1353; <italic>Saganna v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>594 P.2d 69</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>70</cross_reference> (Alaska 1979); <italic>State v. Wortham</italic>, 537 P.2d at 1119-20. In <italic>Seymore</italic>, the defendant had previously been convicted of sexual assault but his record was cleared. 655 P.2d at 787. In <italic>Qualle</italic>, charges were brought, but dismissed because of the victim's unavailability. 652 P.2d at 484. The supreme court<page_number>Page 916</page_number>
has recognized, however, that in an unusual case a worst offender designation could be based on a single event or series of events without a prior record of convictions. <italic>See Wilson v.</italic><italic>State</italic>, <cross_reference>582 P.2d 154</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>156</cross_reference> (Alaska 1978); <italic>Burleson v. State</italic>,<cross_reference>543 P.2d 1195</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1201</cross_reference> (Alaska 1975); <italic>Winslow v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>685 P.2d 1273</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>1275</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1984); <italic>Kimbrell v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>647 P.2d 618</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>620</cross_reference>
n. 5 (Alaska App. 1982); <italic>Huckaby v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>632 P.2d 975</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>976</cross_reference>
(Alaska App. 1981). Such a designation usually involves a finding that the defendant's conduct actually constituted either (1) a higher degree of offense, <italic>see Notaro v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>608 P.2d 769</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>770</cross_reference> (Alaska 1980) (fifteen-year sentence for manslaughter upheld where facts made the crime "an extreme one" within this class, closely equivalent to second-degree murder), <italic>cf.</italic> AS<cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(c)(10) (discussed in <italic>Braaten v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>705 P.2d 1311</cross_reference>
(Alaska App. 1985) (Singleton, concurring)); or (2) a premeditated offense involving substantial injury to the victim or victims, where the defendant had a bad psychological prognosis and showed no remorse, <italic>see Wilson v. State</italic>, 582 P.2d at 156.

We recognize that many of the cases we have reviewed were decided under former law. Up until the new code became effective in 1980, a person nineteen years of age or over who engaged in consensual sexual penetration with a person under the age of sixteen was punishable by imprisonment for any term of years. Former AS 11.15.130(a). A person who had sexual contact with a child for purposes of sexual gratification was punishable by imprisonment for one to ten years. Former AS 11.15.134. As originally enacted, the Revised Code reduced these penalties substantially. It punished sexual assault on a child under the age of thirteen as a class A felony punishable by up to twenty years' imprisonment. Former AS <cross_reference>11.41.410</cross_reference>(a)(3); AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(c). Where sexual penetration occurred and the victim was between thirteen and sixteen years of age or sexual contact occurred with someone under thirteen the offense was a class C felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. Former AS<cross_reference>11.41.440</cross_reference>; AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(e). Sexual contact with someone between the ages of thirteen and sixteen was a class A misdemeanor. Former AS <cross_reference>11.51.130</cross_reference>(a)(4). The statutes were amended in 1980, 1982, and again in 1983. Under current law a person who engages in sexual penetration with a child under the age of thirteen is guilty of an unclassified felony punishable by up to thirty years' imprisonment. AS <cross_reference>11.41.434</cross_reference>(a)(1); AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(i). If someone sixteen or older engages in sexual penetration with someone between thirteen and sixteen, he or she is guilty of a class B felony punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment, unless he or she is less than three years older than the victim. AS <cross_reference>11.41.436</cross_reference>(a)(1); AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(d). The same penalty is reserved for someone sixteen or over who engages in sexual contact with someone under thirteen. AS <cross_reference>11.41.436</cross_reference>(a)(2). Where sexual contact occurs and the victim is between thirteen and sixteen years of age, and at least three years younger than the abuser, the offense is a class C felony with a five-year maximum penalty. AS<cross_reference>11.41.438</cross_reference>; AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(e).

In summary, the drafters of the Revised Code substantially reduced the penalties for sexual abuse of minors. Since 1980, the legislature has increased the penalties, but has not restored them to former levels. Consequently, we do not find that legislative revision of the penalties establishes legislative dissatisfaction with the ranges of sentence we have been discussing.

We are also satisfied that those ranges of sentence are consistent with the current presumptive sentencing provisions of the code. Adoption of presumptive sentencing was aimed at ensuring greater uniformity in sentencing, not at increasing the magnitude of sentences. <italic>See</italic> AS <cross_reference>12.55.005</cross_reference>. Finally, while the eight-year presumptive term presently imposed on first offenders committing unmitigated sexual assaults on children slightly increases the minimum terms recognized in <italic>State v. Brinkley</italic>,<cross_reference>681 P.2d 351</cross_reference>, we do not view this change in the statute as indicating dissatisfaction with the fifteen-year benchmark sentence for<page_number>Page 917</page_number>
aggravated offenses derived from cases decided under former law, at least first felony offenders. In the case of second and third felony offenders, the code does stipulate presumptive sentences of fifteen and twenty-five years, respectively, for those convicted of sexual assault in the first degree, or sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree. AS<cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(i). In aggravated cases, slightly higher sentences would be appropriate. AS <cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>.

Koenig does not have a criminal record. Judge Hanson found that his conduct was among the most serious within the definition of the offense, AS <cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(c)(10), but he did not find that Koenig committed a higher degree of offense. Koenig's offense involved multiple victims, and Judge Hanson may have concluded that Koenig's crimes were premeditated. There is nothing in the record, however, that would justify a finding that Koenig is a dangerous offender in the sense that we have used that term in the past. <italic>See Viveros v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>633 P.2d 289</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>291</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1981) (using term "dangerous offender" as term of art in accordance with 1980 ABA <italic>Standards For Criminal Justice</italic>, which require conviction of two or more felonies within the past five years plus service of a year or more incarceration). It is not clear that Judge Hanson viewed diagnosis as a pedophile sufficient to support a finding that Koenig would continue to be a danger after serving eight years of continuous incarceration.<italic>See Mutschler v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>560 P.2d 377</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>381</cross_reference> (Alaska 1977); <italic>Brown</italic><italic>v.

<block_quote>    The purpose of this chapter is to provide the means for determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on conviction of an offense.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn6]</footnote_number> Alaska Statute <cross_reference>11.41.434</cross_reference>(a)(1) provides in relevant part:

<block_quote>    An offender commits the crime of sexual abuse of a minor in the first degree if . . . being 16 years of age or older, the offender engages in sexual penetration with a person who is under 13 years of age. . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Alaska Statute <cross_reference>11.41.436</cross_reference>(a)(2) provides in relevant part:</block_quote>

<block_quote>    An offender commits the crime of sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree if . . . being 16 years of age or older, the offender engages in sexual contact with a person who is under 13 years of age. . . .</footnote_body></block_quote>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn7]</footnote_number> The state disputes Andrews' claim that paragraph (g) depends upon paragraph (e). It points out that (g) makes no reference to (e) and that (e) sheds no light on the proper interpretation of (g). Further, the state contends that even if (e) were deemed repealed, (g) would still require consecutive sentences for sexual assaults. In light of our decision that (e) was not repealed, it is unnecessary for us to reach these arguments.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn8]</footnote_number> Former AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) provided:

<block_quote>    If the defendant is convicted of two or more crimes before judgment on either has been entered, any sentences of imprisonment may run concurrently or consecutively, as the court provides. If the court does not specify, the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently. If the defendant is imprisoned upon a previous judgment of conviction for a crime, the judgment may provide that the imprisonment commences at the expiration of the term limited by the previous judgment or on the date of imposition of sentence.</block_quote>

Prior to enactment of the revised criminal code, the applicable provision was former AS 11.05.050, which provided:

<block_quote>    If the defendant is convicted of two or more crimes, before judgment on either, the judgment may be that the imprisonment upon one conviction begins at the expiration of the imprisonment for any other of the crimes. If the defendant is imprisoned upon a previous judgment on a conviction for a crime, the judgment may be that the imprisonment commences at the expiration of the term limited by the previous judgment.</footnote_body></block_quote>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn9]</footnote_number> The state does not argue that, even if Judge Lewis had authority to impose concurrent sentences, it was inappropriate to do so in Andrews' case. Our review of the sentencing record discloses, however, that Judge Lewis did not abuse his discretion in imposing concurrent sentences in Andrews' case, so we would affirm the sentence even had this argument been made.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn10]</footnote_number> The state makes a related argument. It reasons that where someone is convicted of two or more offenses each of which is subject to a presumptive term and the court determines that consecutive sentencing is appropriate, the court must impose consecutive presumptive terms. The state argues that AS<cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(f) and (g) (prohibiting suspension or reduction of a presumptive term) must be read in connection with AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g). Thus, if a first offender is convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual assault and no aggravating or mitigating factors were found, the state reasons that the defendants must receive two eight-year terms. AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(i). If the terms are imposed consecutively, a composite sixteen-year sentence is mandatory.

We reject this argument. At the very least AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(f) and (g) are ambiguous when read together with AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g). We are thus obligated to construe their relationship strictly in favor of criminal defendants. While <italic>in pari</italic><italic>materia</italic>, AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(f) and (g) and AS <cross_reference>12.55.025</cross_reference>(e) and (g) address different concerns. We read AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(f) and (g) to require only that a person sentenced at the same time for two or more crimes each of which is subject to a presumptive sentence must receive a sentence at least equal to the most severe presumptive sentence when adjusted to reflect aggravating or mitigating factors. In determining whether these provisions have been satisfied, we must look to the total sentence imposed, not the individual sentence imposed on separate counts. Thus, if the trial court decided to impose consecutive sentences in the hypothetical suggested by the state, AS <cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(g) would require a minimum eight-year composite sentence, but not a sixteen-year sentence. <italic>Cf. Waters v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>483 P.2d 199</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>201-02</cross_reference> (Alaska 1971) (when two or more sentences are imposed together, a sentence which if viewed in isolation might be excessive — or, by extension, too lenient — may be appropriate in light of the total sentences imposed). An eight-year sentence would ensure that the person convicted of multiple offenses serves at least as much time as provided by the presumptive term for his most serious offense.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn11]</footnote_number> Current law establishes an eight-year presumptive term for first offenders convicted of first-degree sexual assault. AS<cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(i)(1). Mitigating factors may reduce this sentence to four years. AS <cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(a)(2). Thus the legislature has slightly increased typical terms over those recognized in <italic>Brinkley.</italic></footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn14]</footnote_number> The Alaska Criminal Code Revision Subcommission explained the "just deserts" theory as follows:

<block_quote>  In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed, two basic principles guide the court:</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (1) the least severe measure should always be used which accomplishes the purposes of sentencing; and</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (2) primary consideration in imposing sentence should always be given to the seriousness of the offense and the prior criminal history of the convicted person.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    Under the "just deserts" theory of punishment, as a matter of justice or fairness, decisions with respect to a particular defendant ought to be made on the  <italic>basis of what the person has done, not on some</italic> <italic>speculative expectation of what he might do in the</italic> <italic>future.</italic> Neither rehabilitation nor deterrence, as such, are primary considerations in determining the appropriate sentence, although both remain objectives of a "deserved" sentence. If a person's crime is serious, his punishment should be severe. If the offense is minor, the sanction should be mild.</block_quote>

T.D. at 19-20 (emphasis supplied). Where a person has been prosecuted as a child molester and nevertheless continues to abuse children, a diagnosis of pedophilia takes on added significance and may justify an extended term. <italic>See, e.g.,</italic><italic>Seymore v.

Our concern is that first offenders, who have never been prosecuted or treated, should not be given this label and then, solely on the basis of the label, treated as, worst offenders and given maximum sentences. <italic>See State v. Rastopsoff</italic>, <cross_reference>659 P.2d 630</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>640</cross_reference> (Alaska App. 1983) (drafters of Revised Code clearly intended to punish more harshly those offenders who had been "alerted" by prior conviction, but who had failed to respond by conforming their conduct to the law).</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn15]</footnote_number> Twenty years with five years suspended results in a fifteen-year period of incarceration equal to the presumptive term for a second unclassified felony offender, AS<cross_reference>12.55.125</cross_reference>(i)(3), and the fifteen-year typical sentence for aggravated rape established under former law. It also allows five years of suspended time as a deterrent to Koenig, in order to protect the public as he makes the adjustment to normal life after his release from prison.</footnote_body><page_number>Page 918</page_number>
