</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  On April 4, 2002, Ignatius A. Tyson eluded Anchorage Police patrol cars during a pursuit that covered several miles on the Glenn Highway. For his conduct leading up to his eventual stop, the grand jury charged Tyson with five felonies: first-degree eluding a police officer, two counts of third-degree assault, second-degree criminal mischief, and first-degree vehicle theft.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Tyson reached a plea agreement with the State: the State filed a two-count information charging first-degree eluding a police officer and second-degree criminal mischief,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> both class C felonies,<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> and Tyson stipulated that statutory aggravating factor AS <cross_reference>12.55.155</cross_reference>(c)(20) — Tyson was on felony probation when he committed the present offenses — applied to his convictions. Because Tyson had a prior felony conviction, he faced a presumptive 2-year term on each count under the pre-March 2005 sentencing code.<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference>

The superior court accepted the parties' stipulation that aggravator (c)(20) applied. The superior court imposed 4 years with 2 years suspended on each count. The unsuspended imprisonment was imposed concurrently, and the suspended imprisonment was imposed consecutively. Thus, the superior court imposed a composite term of 6 years with 4 years suspended.

Tyson was released on probation on February 5, 2005. Shortly after his release, the State filed a petition to revoke his probation, requesting that the superior court impose at least 1 year of Tyson's suspended imprisonment.

Tyson filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Alaska Criminal Rule 35(a), arguing that the superior court's reliance on aggravator (c)(20) violated his right to jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <italic>Blakely v. Washington</italic>.<footnote_reference>[fn5]</footnote_reference>

Superior Court Judge Philip R. Volland rejected Tyson's<italic>Blakely</italic> argument, revoked Tyson's probation, and imposed 1 year of Tyson's suspended imprisonment.

In this appeal, Tyson renews his argument that his sentence is illegal because a jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was on probation at the time of the Glenn Highway incident.

In <italic>Snelling v. State</italic>,<footnote_reference>[fn6]</footnote_reference> we held that when "it is undisputed that [the defendant] was a felony probationer when he committed his current offense, any error in failing to give him a jury trial on [aggravator (c)(20)] is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."<footnote_reference>[fn7]</footnote_reference>

Tyson has not disputed that he was on felony probation in the superior court or in this appeal.<footnote_reference>[fn8]</footnote_reference>

We conclude that Tyson's potential <italic>Blakely</italic> claims are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

<italic>Conclusion</italic>

The judgment of the superior court is AFFIRMED.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn8]</footnote_number> In fact, Tyson stipulated to the aggravator as part of the plea agreement. In <italic>Grasser v.
