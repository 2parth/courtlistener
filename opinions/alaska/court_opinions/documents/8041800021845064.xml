The court shall allow video or Internet testimony if the hearing or deposition involves the custody or visitation of a child of a parent who is deployed, as that term is defined in AS <cross_reference>25.20.095</cross_reference>, at the request of the deployed parent. Authorization for a witness to telephonically participate in a deposition does not bar the witnesses' testimony from being videotaped under Civil Rule 30.1; nor does it bar a party or attorney from being present at the site at which the witness is physically present.</block_quote>
