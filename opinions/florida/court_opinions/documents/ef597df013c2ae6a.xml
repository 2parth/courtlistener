<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    The single issue presented for review is whether filing a counterclaim and motion<page_number>Page 1335</page_number>
to dismiss the complaint at the same time a motion to compel arbitration is filed, without more, waives the contractual right to arbitrate. We hold that it does not. <italic>See Wieneke v. Raymond,</italic><italic>James  Assocs.,</italic> <cross_reference>495 So.2d 869</cross_reference> (Fla. 2d DCA 1986); <italic>Ziegler v.</italic><italic>Knuck,</italic> <cross_reference>419 So.2d 818</cross_reference> (Fla. 3d DCA 1982); and <italic>Genstar S.

Chino Elec., Inc.,</italic> <cross_reference>501 So.2d 69</cross_reference> (Fla. 3d DCA 1987), the case relied on by the appellees, is distinguishable. In <italic>Coral 97</italic> it was the act of implementing discovery, following the simultaneous filings of the counterclaim and motions to arbitrate and dismiss, that was held inconsistent with and thus a waiver of the arbitration right. <italic>Id.</italic> at 70-71.

Reversed and remanded with instructions to order arbitration.
