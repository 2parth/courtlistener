</posture><attorneys>  Mark Perlman of Perlman  Perlow, P.A., Hallandale, for appellant.<page_number>Page 1196</page_number>

</attorneys>
<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    We reverse the order on motion to set aside sentence and to resentence, holding that appellant's motion for disqualification of trial judge should have been granted. Our holding renders moot the additional points on appeal posed by appellant. We therefore reverse and remand for another hearing on the motion to set aside appellant's sentence, to be conducted before a different trial judge.

REVERSED AND REMANDED.

HERSEY, C.J., and WALDEN and GARRETT, JJ., concur.
