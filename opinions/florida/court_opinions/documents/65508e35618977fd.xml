<opinion_text>  John M. Armey appeals a nonfinal order dismissing without prejudice his amended motion for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. The nonfinal order grants Armey thirty days to file a "properly sworn" motion. In his motion for rehearing filed with the postconviction court, Armey states he will not file another amended motion and a review of the circuit court docket establishes that Armey has not filed another motion. We recognize that, pursuant to <underline>Christner v. State</underline>,<cross_reference>984 So. 2d 561</cross_reference> (Fla. 2d DCA 2008), we must first relinquish jurisdiction for the<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
entry of a final, appealable order before we can address the merits of the postconviction court's decision.

Accordingly, we relinquish jurisdiction to the postconviction court with instructions to enter a final order within thirty days.<underline>See</underline> <underline>Christner</underline>, <cross_reference>984 So. 2d at 563</cross_reference>. KELLY and WALLACE, JJ., Concur.
