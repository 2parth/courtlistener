<opinion_text>  Because petitioner has failed to show a clear legal right to the relief requested, he is not entitled to mandamus relief. Accordingly, the petition for writ of mandamus is hereby denied. See Huffman v. State,<cross_reference>813 So. 2d 10</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>11</cross_reference> (Fla. 2000) (stating that in order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, petitioner must show clear legal right to performance of requested act, that respondent has indisputable legal duty to perform that act, and that no other adequate remedy exists); cf. Tyson v. Fla. Bar, <cross_reference>826 So. 2d 265</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>268</cross_reference> (Fla. 2002) (holding that complainant has no legal right to force The Florida Bar to pursue disciplinary charges against attorney). Petitioner's "Motion to Add Transcript of Hearing in Support of Petition for Writ of Mandamus" is also denied.

WELLS, ANSTEAD, PARIENTE, CANTERO, and BELL, JJ., concur.
