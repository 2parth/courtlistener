<opinion_text>    The Board of Governors of The Florida Bar has filed herein its recommendation for reinstatement in The Florida Bar of Harry B. Donley, approving the favorable report and recommendations of the Grievance Committee of the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, pursuant to Integration Rule 11.11 (10), 32 F.S.A.

It appears that petitioner was adjudged incompetent by order of the County Judge's Court of Martin County, and was thereby automatically suspended from the practice of law in Florida.

In view of the favorable findings of the Grievance Committee and the Board of Governors, we concur in the judgment that petitioner is entitled to reinstatement.

Ordered that petitioner Harry B. Donley be and is hereby reinstated to membership in The Florida Bar.

It is so ordered.
