Jonathan M. Deer of Anderson  Orcutt, P.A., Tampa, for appellee.

<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    Appellants, James B. Loper and James B. Loper, P.A., appeal a final judgment for money damages entered for appellee.

While the evidence was conflicting in regard to appellee's claims against appellants, there was a sufficient evidentiary basis established to support the judgment and we, therefore, affirm. We write only in regard to an issue raised by appellants which sought to invalidate a constructive trust as a part of the final judgment. Upon a careful examination of the final judgment, we have determined that it does not establish a constructive trust.

Affirmed.

CAMPBELL, C.J., and SCHOONOVER and THREADGILL, JJ., concur.<page_number>Page 530</page_number>
