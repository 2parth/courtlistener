<opinion_text>  This is an appeal of an order summarily denying a motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a). On appeal from a summary denial, this court must reverse unless the postconviction record, <italic>see</italic>
Fla.R.App.P. 9.141(b)(2)(A), shows conclusively that the appellant is entitled to no relief. <italic>See</italic> Fla.R.App.P. 9.141(b)(2)(D).

The defendant argues that the written sentence, which classifies him as a habitual felony offender and a habitual violent felony offender, does not conform with the trial court's oral sentencing pronouncement. Because the record now before us fails to make the required showing, <italic>see Lundy</italic><italic>v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>912 So.2d 671</cross_reference> (Fla. 3d DCA 2005), we reverse the order and remand for further proceedings or for the attachment of record excerpts conclusively showing that the appellant is not entitled to relief.

Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.<page_number>Page 766</page_number>
