<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    The trial court departed from the recommended guidelines sentence of two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half years imprisonment and sentenced Albury to ten years imprisonment upon a finding that Albury was a habitual offender. In <italic>Whitehead v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>498 So.2d 863</cross_reference>
(Fla. 1986), decided after the trial court imposed sentence on Albury, the Florida Supreme Court held that the habitual offender statute, ยง <cross_reference>775.084</cross_reference>, Fla. Stat. (1985), is neither an alternative to guidelines sentencing nor an adequate reason for departure from the recommended guidelines sentence.<italic>Whitehead</italic> thus compels reversal of the sentence and a remand for<page_number>Page 461</page_number>
resentencing within the recommended guidelines.

Reversed and remanded.
