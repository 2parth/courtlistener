<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    We grant certiorari and quash the trial court's order disqualifying petitioner's counsel in the civil action below. The circumstances simply do not give rise to any appearance of impropriety, much less to the kind of appearance warranting the drastic remedy of disqualifying a litigant's civil trial lawyer.

CERTIORARI GRANTED; ORDER QUASHED.

ANSTEAD, POLEN and FARMER, JJ., concur.
