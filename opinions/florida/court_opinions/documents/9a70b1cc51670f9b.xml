<opinion_text>    The defendant's convictions for both dealing in stolen property (ยง <cross_reference>812.019</cross_reference>, Fla. Stat.) and grand theft (ยง <cross_reference>812.014</cross_reference>, Fla. Stat.) in connection with one scheme or course of conduct was improper. ยง <cross_reference>812.025</cross_reference>, Fla.

(Fla. 5th DCA 1981). The conviction for the lesser degree crime, the grand theft conviction, is vacated. <italic>Ridley.</italic>
Because the defendant was not sentenced on the grand theft conviction and because a minor error in the guideline scoresheet does not affect the defendant's guideline scoresheet cell, nothing further need be done.

CONVICTION FOR COUNT TWO, GRAND THEFT VACATED; CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES FOR COUNTS ONE AND THREE AFFIRMED.
