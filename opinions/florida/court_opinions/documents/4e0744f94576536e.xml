<opinion_byline>    PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>    Appellant was convicted after a non-jury trial of aggravated child abuse. As the<page_number>Page 1209</page_number>
state concedes in its brief, this conviction must be reversed. The record contains no written waiver of jury trial; nor did the trial court conduct an inquiry on the record that appellant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial. <italic>See Tucker v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>559 So.2d 218</cross_reference> (Fla. 1990); <italic>Sinkfield v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>681 So.2d 838</cross_reference> (Fla. 4th DCA 1996). We find no error in the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for judgment of acquittal.

REVERSED.

GUNTHER, FARMER and GROSS, JJ., concur.
