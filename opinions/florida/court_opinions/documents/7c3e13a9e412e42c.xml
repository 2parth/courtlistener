<opinion_text>  As petitioner has failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to the relief requested, the petition for writ of mandamus is denied. <underline>See</underline> <underline>Huffman v. State</underline>, <cross_reference>813 So. 2d 10</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>11</cross_reference> (Fla. 2000) (holding that in order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, the petitioner must show that he has a clear legal right to performance of the requested act, that the respondent has an indisputable legal duty to perform that act, and that no other adequate remedy exists).

WELLS, ANSTEAD, LEWIS, CANTERO and BELL, JJ., concur.
