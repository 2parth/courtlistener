<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  We have for review the decision in <underline>State v. Cowart</underline>, 24 Fla. L. Weekly D1085 (Fla. 2d DCA Apr. 28, 1999), which the court certified to be in conflict with the opinion in <underline>Woods v. State</underline>,<cross_reference>740 So.2d 20</cross_reference> (Fla. 1st DCA 1999), and <underline>McKnight v. State</underline>,<cross_reference>727 So.2d 314</cross_reference> (Fla. 3d DCA 1999). We have jurisdiction. <underline>See</underline> art. V, § 3(b)(4), Fla. Const.

We recently approved the First District's decision in <underline>Woods</underline>, holding that the Act, as properly interpreted by the First District, does not violate separation of powers, and rejecting other constitutional challenges to the Act. <underline>See</underline> <underline>State v. Cotton</underline>, SC94996  SC95281 (Fla. June 15, 2000). Accordingly, for the reasons expressed in <underline>Cotton</underline>, we quash the Second District's decision in this case, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<page_number>Page 1101</page_number>
Because it appears that the respondent entered a plea of guilty based upon the trial court's indication that respondent, upon such plea, would not be sentenced pursuant to the Act, upon remand to the trial court, respondent shall have the right to withdraw his guilty plea.

It is so ordered.

HARDING, C.J., and SHAW, WELLS, ANSTEAD, PARIENTE and LEWIS, JJ., concur.

QUINCE, J., dissents with an opinion.
