</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Donald Anderson appeals from an indeterminate ten year sentence to the custody of the state Board of Correction, imposed upon a conviction for robbery. The sole issue is whether the sentence was an abuse of the district court's sentencing discretion.

Anderson plead guilty to the robbery of a commercial establishment in Twin Falls, Idaho. He displayed a firearm in committing the crime. The presentence report shows that he had served sentences of incarceration for a number of felony and misdemeanor offenses. Having reviewed the full record and having considered the sentence review criteria set forth in <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Toohill</italic>, <cross_reference>103 Idaho 565</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>650 P.2d 707</cross_reference> (Ct.App. 1982), we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The sentence is affirmed.<page_number>Page 173</page_number>
