The Commission has asked the Court to consolidate these two matters in the interests of judicial economy, asserting the matters arise from the same set of circumstances and, with few exceptions, are identical. Counsel for the Respondents have indicated they have no objection to the requested consolidation.Having considered the Commission's motion and being duly advised, the Court GRANTS the Commission's motion. The Clerk of this Court is instructed to consolidate these matters into cause number 49S00-0804-JD-157, and make an appropriate entry on the docket of cause number 49S00-0804-JD-156 so indicating.
