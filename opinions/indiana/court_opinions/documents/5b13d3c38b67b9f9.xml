<opinion_text>  The appellant upon a plea of guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor was fined five dollars and costs which she paid and given a suspended sentence of six months in Indiana Woman's Prison. Over three months later and at a subsequent term she filed petition with affidavits attached to set aside the judgment and substitute a plea of not guilty for her former plea. The court granted a hearing at which affidavits and counteraffidavits were admitted and read in evidence and oral testimony was taken all of which is sought to be brought in the record by a bill of exceptions. All the evidence is abstracted in appellant's brief.

The petition filed after the term was too late. <italic>State ex rel.</italic><italic>Thomas</italic> v. <italic>Murray, Judge</italic> (1942), <cross_reference>219 Ind. 461</cross_reference>,  <cross_reference>39 N.E.2d 450</cross_reference>.
