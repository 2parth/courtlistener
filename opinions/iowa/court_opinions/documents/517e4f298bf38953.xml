By action of this court en banc, the thirteen standard forms for domestic abuse, stalking, harassment, and sexual abuse orders are replaced in their entirety with the fourteen new forms attached to this order. These new forms shall take effect October 1, 2003.

The purpose of these new forms is to facilitate Full Faith and Credit recognition and enforcement in other jurisdictions.<cross_reference>18 U.S.C. ยง 2265</cross_reference>. This objective is primarily accomplished by utilizing a standardized first-page format similar to that being used by other states. Accordingly, the first page of these orders may not be substantially charged in content, format, or font. Moreover, to ensure Full Faith and Credit is afforded to Iowa protective orders, these standardized forms must be used in dissolution proceedings.

Dated this 28th day of August, 2003.
