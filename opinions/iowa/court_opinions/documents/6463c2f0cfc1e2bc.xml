<opinion_text>  Defendant-appellant David Londrie appeals his conviction and sentence, following a jury trial, for possession of methamphetamine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of Iowa Code section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(1)(b)(7) (2001) (Count I), possession of methamphetamine with the intent to deliver methamphetamine, in violation of section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(1)(b)(7) (Count II), possession of anhydrous ammonia with the intent to use it as a precursor, in violation of section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(4) (Count III), and failure to affix a tax stamp, in violation of section <cross_reference>453B.12</cross_reference>
(Count IV). Defendant claims on appeal (1) the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal for possession with intent to manufacture methamphetamine; (2) the district court erred in entering judgment for possession with intent to manufacture methamphetamine; (3) the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial; (4) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance; and (5) the inventory search of his car was unreasonable. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and preserve defendant's ineffective assistance claims for postconviction review.

On November 25, 2001 defendant and Stephanie Jones were leaving the Wal-Mart parking lot in Keokuk, Iowa, when they were stopped by Officer Donald Whitaker. Officer Whitaker recognized defendant and determined there was an open warrant for his arrest. He stopped defendant's car, advised him of the warrant, requested that he exit the car, and placed him in handcuffs. Officer Whitaker then requested Jones exit the car. She complied, carrying her purse with her. Jones admitted she had a knife in her purse. Officer Whitaker removed the purse from her and searched it, finding a nylon bag with a spoon, syringes, and a plunger inside it; the knife; clear glass tubes, one containing a liquid, another containing a powder; a plastic bag containing marijuana cigarettes; and a small glass container with powder inside. Officer Whitaker then searched inside the car, finding a bag of unused syringes on the floorboard in the front seat, and a margarine container holding approximately sixty-nine pills by the front-seat armrest. In the trunk Officer Whitaker found, among other things, a breathing apparatus, a battery, and a propane tank with altered fittings. Before the tank was destroyed for safety purposes, officers detected the odor of anhydrous ammonia emanating from it. Officer Whitaker arranged for the car to be towed and later performed an inventory search of it. By that time he was informed by Officer Londrie,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> who had interviewed Jones, that there was a bag of methamphetamine hidden under the passenger seat in defendant's car. Jones claimed ownership of the contents of her purse and of the bag of new syringes. Officers Londrie and Whitaker discovered a bag packed full of what was later determined to be methamphetamine under the passenger seat in defendant's car. It was later determined to contain over 120 grams of methamphetamine. The following day Jones directed officers to a propane tank underneath a railroad bridge. The fittings on the tank were discolored, indicating another chemical besides propane had been inside it.

Officers later executed a search warrant of the residence of defendant's brother, Keith Londrie, where defendant stayed part of the time. In that search officers recovered a plastic bag containing an LP tank, Coleman fuel, and a bottle of Heet in the back of an El Camino automobile belonging to defendant. Inside the car was another LP tank with altered fittings. A storage shed contained additional Coleman fuel.

Inside the home officers discovered several items associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine. These items included used coffee filters, a glass tool somewhat like a pestle, a jug of rock salt, jugs of drain cleaner, a jar with black tubing, and a cartridge for a respirator. In Keith and his wife Elizabeth's bedroom they found a baggie of marijuana and a safe containing instructions on manufacturing methamphetamine, marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and over $4000 cash.

Testimony at trial by Keith and Elizabeth Londrie indicated the bag found under the car seat containing over 120 grams of methamphetamine was the defendant's. Testimony also indicated defendant lived "off and on" in Keith's and Elizabeth's trailer, sometimes having almost complete run of the home, from either summer or November of 2000 to his arrest in November of 2001.

<center>                           <bold>I. SCOPE OF REVIEW</bold></center>
Defendant first argues there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction and sentence for possession of methamphetamine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine (Count I). We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence for correction of errors at law. Iowa R.App.P. 6.4;<italic>State v. Speicher,</italic> <cross_reference>625 N.W.2d 738</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>740</cross_reference> (Iowa 2001).

<center>                <bold>II. POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO MANUFACTURE</bold></center>
Defendant was initially charged with conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine (Count I). The court granted defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on this count. The court denied the State's motion to amend the charge on Count I to manufacture of methamphetamine, concluding the State's proposed amendment would amount to a wholly new and separate charge. <italic>See</italic> Iowa R.App.P. 2.4(8)(<italic>a</italic>). The court instead modified the charge on Count I to possession with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, justifying this modification as an alternative means of violating section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(1)(b)(7), the section under which the conspiracy count was charged. <italic>See State v. Maghee,</italic> <cross_reference>573 N.W.2d 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>6-7</cross_reference> (Iowa 1997).

In submitting this charge of possession with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine to the jury, the court submitted the following instruction:

<block_quote>  The State must prove all of the following elements of Possession with Intent to Manufacture Methamphetamine:</block_quote>

<block_quote>  1. On or about November 1, 2001, through November 25, 2001, the defendant knowingly possessed Methamphetamine.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2. The defendant knew the substance he possessed was Methamphetamine.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3. The defendant possessed the substance with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance.</block_quote>

If the State has proved all of the elements, the defendant is guilty of Possession with the Intent to Manufacture Methamphetamine. If the State has failed to prove any one of the elements, the defendant is not guilty of Possession with the Intent to Manufacture Methamphetamine and you will then consider the charge of Possession of a Controlled Substance, as explained in Instruction No. 22.

The court further instructed the jury on the definition of "manufacture":

<block_quote>  "Manufacture" means the production, preparation, growing or processing of a controlled substance, either directly or by extraction from natural substances, or independently by means of chemical process, or both. It includes any packaging or repacking of the substance, or labeling or relabeling of its container. If a person prepares a controlled substance for his or her own use, it is not "manufacture."</block_quote>

Although the jury found the defendant guilty of possession with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, the State concedes the evidence does not support this finding. The substance in the bag under the passenger seat at the time of the November 25 arrest, which was determined to be defendant's, was methamphetamine in its finished form. Besides the substances found in Jones's purse, which she claimed were hers, this is the only evidence of an illegal substance in defendant's possession. There is no evidence any of this methamphetamine was meant to be relabeled or repacked. We therefore conclude the trial court was in error not to grant the defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on Count I, possession of methamphetamine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine.

<center>                     <bold>III. MERGER OF COUNTS I AND II</bold></center>
As we have concluded defendant's conviction on Count I was not supported by sufficient evidence, we vacate defendant's sentence on Count I.

<center>                      <bold>IV. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</bold></center>
Prior to trial defendant filed two motions in limine in which he sought to exclude from trial evidence of his prior convictions and evidence of an outstanding warrant for his arrest which was in existence when he was stopped and taken into custody in this case. The court granted the motions, concluding with respect to the outstanding warrant that it would be prejudicial to the defendant for the jury to know he had been stopped on an outstanding warrant.

During opening statements, which were unreported, the prosecutor apparently informed the jury that officers pulled defendant's car over due to a "stop order." No objection was made at the time, but following opening statements defense counsel moved for a mistrial, claiming the jury had been prejudiced by being informed of the "stop order." The court denied the motion, stating the comments by the prosecutor may not have actually violated the court's order excluding evidence of defendant's arrest warrant, but that they may have violated the spirit of the order. Due to this possible violation, the court extended the motion in limine to exclude all evidence that there was any information from the police station justifying a stop of the defendant's vehicle, but it denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial.

On appeal defendant claims the court's denial of his motion for a mistrial was in error. We review the court's ruling denying the motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Greene,</italic> <cross_reference>592 N.W.2d 24</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>30</cross_reference> (Iowa 1999). We find such an abuse of discretion only where (1) there was prosecutorial misconduct, and (2) the defendant was so prejudiced by this misconduct that it deprived him of a fair trial. <italic>Id</italic>.

We agree with the court that although the statement by the prosecutor regarding a "stop order" may have violated the spirit of the court's order, it did not clearly violate the actual order, which excluded evidence of arrest warrants, not "stop orders." The court remedied the matter by expanding the scope of the motion in limine to exclude any statements providing any evidence at all as to why the police were justified in stopping defendant. We find no abuse of discretion.

<center>                  <bold>V. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</bold></center>
In the alternative, defendant argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor's "stop order" comment immediately after it was made. Defendant also argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the extensive testimony regarding his alleged drug use and practices on dates prior to those listed in the trial information and for failing to file a motion for new trial on the issue of improper evidence under Iowa Rule of Evidence 5.404(<italic>b</italic>).

We review ineffective assistance of counsel claims de novo.<italic>State v. Osborn,</italic> <cross_reference>573 N.W.2d 917</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>920</cross_reference> (Iowa 1998). To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, both that his trial counsel failed to perform an essential duty and that prejudice resulted from that failure. <italic>State v. Smothers,</italic><cross_reference>590 N.W.2d 721</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>722</cross_reference> (Iowa 1999). We may dispose of the claim if defendant fails to demonstrate either element. <italic>State v. Query,</italic><cross_reference>594 N.W.2d 438</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>445</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct.App. 1999). To sustain his burden of proof with respect to the duty element, defendant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel's actions were reasonable under the circumstances and fell within the normal range of professional competency. <italic>Smothers,</italic> <cross_reference>590 N.W.2d at 722</cross_reference>. Miscalculated trial strategies and mere mistakes in judgment generally do not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. <italic>Ledezma v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>626 N.W.2d 134</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>143</cross_reference> (Iowa 2001). Thus, claims of ineffective assistance involving tactical or strategic decisions of counsel must be examined in light of all the circumstances to ascertain whether the actions were a product of tactics or inattention to the responsibilities of an attorney guaranteed defendant under the Sixth Amendment. <italic>Id</italic>.

The trial record is often inadequate for us to resolve claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel raised on direct appeal. <italic>Berryhill v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>603 N.W.2d 243</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>245</cross_reference> (Iowa 1999). For this reason we preserve defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims for postconviction relief proceedings to allow for the development of a record on trial counsel's performance. <italic>Id.</italic>

Defendant also argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a new trial based on the weight of the evidence with respect to Count I. We have already found the evidence does not support a conviction under Count I and have vacated defendant's sentence for Count I. We therefore need not address defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on this issue.

<center>                          <bold>VI. INVENTORY SEARCH</bold></center>
Defendant's last argument is that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress the evidence discovered following an inventory search of his car. In determining whether an inventory search violates an individual's Fourth Amendment protections, we must determine (1) whether the impoundment was valid; and (2) whether the scope of the inventory was reasonable.<italic>State v. Huisman,</italic> <cross_reference>544 N.W.2d 433</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>436</cross_reference> (Iowa 1996). In making this determination we must examine whether the search was conducted according to reasonable standardized procedures with purposes other than investigating possible criminal activity. <italic>Id.</italic> at 437.

In this case both occupants of the vehicle at issue were lawfully arrested and taken into custody, leaving nobody to drive the car. The district court found the decision to impound the car was made at the scene of the stop, and that the City of Keokuk Police Department has an established policy of inventorying all vehicles it impounds. The bag containing the methamphetamine later determined to be defendant's was found under the passenger seat. We conclude the inventory search was reasonable.
