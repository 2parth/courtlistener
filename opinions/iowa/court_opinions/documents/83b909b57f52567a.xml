<opinion_text>  A father appeals the termination of his parental rights to his child. He contends the State failed to prove the grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence. He also contends the State failed to provide reasonable efforts to reunify him with his child and termination is not in the child's best interest. We review his claims de novo. <italic>In re</italic><italic>N.V.</italic>, <cross_reference>744 N.W.2d 634</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>636</cross_reference> (Iowa 2008).

The district court terminated the father's parental rights pursuant to Iowa Code sections <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(h) and (j) (2007). We need only find termination proper under one ground to affirm.<italic>In re R.R.K.</italic>, <cross_reference>544 N.W.2d 274</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>276</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct.App. 1995). The father argues the State failed to prove the grounds for termination pursuant to section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j). He does not dispute termination was warranted under section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(h) and therefore has waived this issue on appeal. Iowa R. App. P. 6.14(1)(<italic>c</italic>).

We also conclude the father has failed to preserve error on the issue of whether the State provided reasonable efforts to reunify him and the child. A challenge to the sufficiency of such services should be raised when the services are offered.<italic>In re L.M.W.</italic>, <cross_reference>518 N.W.2d 804</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>807</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct. App. 1994). The father fails to state what services should have been offered and at no point requested services beyond those offered to him.

Finally, we conclude termination is in the child's best interest. Even if the statutory requirements for termination of parental rights are met, the decision to terminate must be in the children's best interests. <italic>In re M.S.</italic>,<cross_reference>519 N.W.2d 398</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>400</cross_reference> (Iowa 1994). In considering the best interests of the children, we look to their long-range as well as immediate best interests. <italic>In re C.K.</italic>, <cross_reference>558 N.W.2d 170</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>172</cross_reference> (Iowa 1997). Here, the father has a history of violent, criminal conduct. Some of this conduct was aimed at the child's mother. The father is currently serving a twenty-four-year prison sentence and blames the mother for his situation. As the district court noted, "[The father] presents a very serious risk to [the mother]'s physical and emotional well-being and, as a result of that risk, presents a meaningful risk of harm to [the child]'s physical and emotional well-being." The father fails to recognize the risk he presents to the child and has not taken steps to adequately address these behaviors. Accordingly, we affirm the district court order terminating his parental rights to his child.

<bold>AFFIRMED.</bold>
