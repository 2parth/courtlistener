<opinion_text>  Teresa Dumerauf pled guilty to third-degree theft in violation of Iowa Code sections <cross_reference>714.2</cross_reference>(3) and <cross_reference>714.1</cross_reference>(1) (2001). On appeal, her primary contention is that her plea lacked a factual basis and trial counsel was ineffective in allowing her to enter it. She also maintains counsel should have filed a motion in arrest of judgment and should have insisted that the district court better inform her of the nature of the offense. We preserve these ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims for postconviction relief to allow trial counsel an opportunity to respond to them. <italic>See ate v. Shortridge</italic>, <cross_reference>589 N.W.2d 76</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>84</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct. App. 1998).
