<opinion_text>  A mother and father appeal from a juvenile court order terminating their parental rights to their daughter. They contend the State failed to prove the statutory grounds necessary for termination by clear and convincing evidence and failed to make reasonable efforts to reunite them with their child. The paternal grandparents of the child have also appealed requesting that the juvenile court's termination order be reversed. Upon our de novo review, we affirm the juvenile court's termination order.

<bold><italic>I. Background Facts  Proceedings</italic></bold>

Sue Ann W. and Matthew W. are the unmarried parents of a daughter, Macie. In November of 2001, Matthew was convicted of domestic assault and placed on probation. Sue Ann gave birth to Macie on February 2, 2002. The following month, the district court found Matthew in contempt for violating the terms of his probation by failing to participate in a batterer's education program. In early July 2002, a no contact order that had previously been lifted was reinstated at Sue Ann's request based on allegations of domestic abuse. As a result, Matthew was prevented from having contact with Sue Ann and Macie.

The record reveals Macie first came to the juvenile court's attention in July 2002. At that time, Sue Ann did not have an appropriate residence for her daughter and was unable to meet her child's basic needs. The juvenile court removed Macie from Sue Ann's care.

Sue Ann did not maintain consistent contact with her daughter after the child was removed from her care. Meanwhile, Matthew was incarcerated in the county jail in August 2002 on charges of perjury. On September 11, 2002, the juvenile court adjudicated Macie a child in need of assistance (CINA).

Sue Ann began having more regular contact with Macie after she was placed in the Light House program in late September in an effort to improve her parenting skills. Unfortunately, after a brief period of improvement, Sue Ann's behavior deteriorated and she was unsuccessfully discharged from that program in December 2002. Sue Ann entered a family shelter, but then left the state in violation of her the terms of her probation on a criminal charge. Sue Ann was arrested in March 2003 and incarcerated. While the child in need of assistance proceeding was pending, Matthew was sentenced to prison for a term not to exceed five years.

On May 29, 2003, the State filed a petition to terminate Sue Ann and Matthew's parental rights to Macie. Following a contested hearing, the court terminated the parental rights of both parents by order entered November 5, 2003.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> Sue Ann's parental rights were terminated under Iowa Code sections <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(b) (2003) (abandonment), (e) (child CINA, child removed for six months, parent has not maintained significant or meaningful contact with the child), and (h) (child is three or younger, child CINA, removed from home for six of last twelve months, and cannot be returned home). The father's parental rights were terminated under sections <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(e) and (h). Sue Ann, Matthew, and Matthew's parents have appealed.

<bold><italic>II. Scope of Review</italic></bold>

We review termination proceedings de novo. <italic>In re S.N.,</italic><cross_reference>500 N.W.2d 32</cross_reference>, 34 (Iowa 1993). The grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. <italic>In re T.B.,</italic><cross_reference>604 N.W.2d 660</cross_reference>, 661 (Iowa 2001). Our primary concern is the best interests of the child. <italic>In re C.B.,</italic> <cross_reference>611 N.W.2d 489</cross_reference>, 492 (Iowa 2000).

<bold><italic>III. Discussion</italic></bold>

Sue Ann contends there was insufficient evidence to support the termination of her parental rights on the grounds cited by the juvenile court. We disagree. We conclude the mother's parental rights were properly terminated under Iowa Code section<cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(h) (child is three or younger, child CINA, removed from home for six of last twelve months, and cannot be returned home).

Sue Ann did not engage in any affirmative parenting of her daughter during the CINA proceedings. She had no visits with her daughter between December 24, 2002, and July 2003. When the termination hearing commenced in July 2003, Sue Ann was incarcerated. She was later placed in a residential facility but violated the facility's rules and was returned to jail. At the time the termination hearing was completed in October, Sue Ann was awaiting a further period of incarceration in a violator's program. Obviously, she was in no position to resume parenting her child when the termination hearing was held. Because grounds for termination under section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(h) were satisfied, we find it unnecessary to address Sue Ann's challenges to the other statutory grounds for termination cited by the juvenile court.<italic>See In re A.J.,</italic> <cross_reference>553 N.W.2d 909</cross_reference>, 911 (Iowa Ct. App. 1996) (holding when the juvenile court terminates parental rights on more that one statutory ground, the appellate court only needs to find grounds to terminate parental rights under one of the sections cited by the juvenile court in order to affirm the juvenile court).

Sue Ann also suggests that the Department of Human Services (DHS) did not make reasonable efforts to address her mental health issues. We find no indication in the record that the trial court was asked to address this issue. The mother did not request additional services at any time in the CINA proceedings and the issue is not mentioned in the termination order. Accordingly, we conclude this issue has not been preserved for appeal. <italic>In re</italic><italic>J.L.W.,</italic> <cross_reference>570 N.W.2d 778</cross_reference>, 781 (Iowa Ct. App. 1997). Even if Sue Ann had preserved error, the record reveals she received services, but did not benefit from them. We find that additional services would not have alleviated the problems facing Sue Ann within a reasonable period of time.

Matthew also claims the statutory grounds for termination cited by the juvenile court were not met. We disagree. We find that Matthew's parental rights were properly terminated under section<cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(h). Matthew was sent to prison in the fall of 2002. He was still incarcerated when the termination hearing commenced in July 2003 and acknowledged that he was not able to have Macie returned to him. Matthew was released from custody in August 2003 subject to an order that required him to be placed in a residential facility as soon as space became available. Matthew's probation officer testified that Matthew might not have to go to that facility if he continued to comply with the terms of his probation; however, his future was at best uncertain when the termination hearing concluded. Moreover, the record made at the termination hearing reveals that Mathew has still not finished addressing his domestic violence issues and some obvious parenting deficiencies. We find the juvenile court properly concluded that Macie could not be placed with her father at the time the termination hearing was held.

Matthew also argues the juvenile court erred in terminating his parental rights pursuant to Iowa Code section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(e) because the grounds for termination were not proved by clear and convincing evidence and DHS did not provide reasonable services to him while he was in prison. Because we have already concluded that the statutory grounds for termination under section<cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(h) were met, we need not address this issue. <italic>See In</italic><italic>re A.J.,</italic> 553 N.W.2d at 911.

We conclude the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that Sue Ann and Matthew's parental rights should be terminated.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> Macie should not have to wait any longer for responsible parenting. She deserves permanency and stability. Termination of Sue Ann and Matthew's parental rights clearly serves their child's best interests. Accordingly, we affirm the juvenile court.
