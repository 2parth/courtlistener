<opinion_text>  Defendant claims there was not sufficient evidence to support his convictions for driving while barred and interference with official acts. He also claims the trial court abused its discretion by ordering consecutive sentences. In addition he asserts he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel during sentencing.

During the afternoon of July 5, 1999 Muscatine County Deputy Sheriff, David Lerch, responded to a 911 call and went to a disturbance at 101 Moore Street in Fruitland, Iowa. When he arrived he saw defendant sitting inside a white Ford Escort in front of this address. He later saw a one and a half year old child in a child's seat in the back seat of this car. Tammi Gerels, defendant's ex-wife, owned this vehicle. Jay Gerels knew he was barred from driving.

Officer Lerch testified defendant backed the car up from five to ten feet and attempted to drive around him. Sandra Lessinger, defendant's former mother-in-law, testified he drove the car from the front of the house around to the side of the house on the black top street.

Sandra Lessinger testified defendant and Tammi Gerels were arguing and defendant became loud and physical with Tammi. She called 911 for help to stop the disturbance.

Among other things, Officer Lerch testified defendant refused to give him his name. Also defendant attempted to prevent him from talking with Tammi in an attempt to determine what had happened. He refused to comply with the officer's requests and he used loud profane and obscene language. Officer Lerch called for assistance and another deputy sheriff arrived to help him. The two officers wrestled defendant to the ground and handcuffed his hands behind his back.

Defendant was charged with driving while barred and interference with official acts.

On July 9, 1999 a deputy sheriff saw defendant leave the court house, get into a vehicle and drive away. He was again charged with driving while barred.

Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and all charges were tried to the court. The court found defendant guilty of all charges. On his conviction for driving while barred on July 5, 1999, defendant was sentenced not to exceed two years and sentenced not to exceed thirty days for interference with official acts, to be served concurrently.

On the charge of driving while barred on July 9, 1999, the defendant was sentenced to a prison term not to exceed two years, to be served consecutively to the other sentence.

Our review is for corrections of errors of law. Iowa R. App. P.6.4.

<bold>I. Substantial Evidence</bold>. Substantial evidence is that which would convince a rational trier of fact that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <italic>State v.</italic><italic>Estello,</italic> <cross_reference>602 N.W.2d 190</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>197</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct.App. 1999). The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <italic>State v. Anderson,</italic> <cross_reference>517 N.W.2d 208</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>211</cross_reference> (Iowa 1994). The appellate court broadly and liberally construes the fact finder's conclusions and in cases of ambiguity, will uphold rather than defeat a verdict. <italic>State v. Price,</italic> <cross_reference>365 N.W.2d 632</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>633</cross_reference>
(Iowa Ct.App. 1985). Findings of fact in jury-waived cases shall have the affect of a special verdict. Iowa R. App. P.4. Although we are not bound by the trial court's findings, we do give them weight for it is the trial court who has the parties before it and is in the best position to make determinations of credibility. <italic>In</italic><italic>re Marriage of Sprague,</italic> <cross_reference>545 N.W.2d 325</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>327</cross_reference>, (Iowa Ct.App. 1996).

Following the above legal principals, we determine sufficient evidence exists in this case to support defendant's convictions for driving while barred and interference with official acts. We affirm on this issue.

<bold>II. Abuse of Discretion</bold>. Defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences. A court's sentencing decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Privitt,</italic> <cross_reference>571 N.W.2d 484</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>486</cross_reference> (Iowa 1997).

Attorney for the State objected to defendant's attorney's question to officer Furnas about officer Lerch's weight. The court overruled the objection and admonished defendant's attorney in pertinent part as follows:

<block_quote>  . . . the court has been indulgent allowing defendant because of criminal difficulties and his attorney's medical condition to continue the trial through the course of last year. (We note defendant's attorney suffered a stroke).</block_quote>

<block_quote>  To expand inquiries in areas like this delays a resolution of this matter. There is only a half a day to try this case. I ask you to exercise good judgment.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  I don't think that his response is going to help the court determine defendant's guilt or innocence. If you think about it you will concur.</block_quote>

The court also indicated the ability to determine weight of another individual is not going to be a determining factor in this case.

The trial court appeared irritated toward defendant and his attorney. We do not condone the court expressing his irritation during the trial.

Defendant alleges this demonstrates hostility and is the basis for the judge giving defendant consecutive sentences as opposed to concurrent sentences. This is a close question.

Relevant factors in determining a proper sentence include the nature of the offense, the attending circumstances, the defendant's age, character, and propensities for chances for reform. <italic>State v. August,</italic> <cross_reference>589 N.W.2d 740</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>744</cross_reference> (Iowa 1999). A sentencing court has a duty to explain its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences. <italic>State v. Uthe,</italic> <cross_reference>542 N.W.2d 810</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>816</cross_reference> (Iowa 1996). At sentencing here, the trial court stated to the defendant:

<block_quote>  . . . monetary sanctions in the past and short duration jail sentences are of little consequences to you. In addition to driving without valid privileges, you have twice been convicted of operating while intoxicated. One case was continued because you were serving a jail sentence in another jurisdiction. Your attitude with respect to traffic laws of this State is well documented by your decision to attend a court session for one charge of driving while you'd been barred from doing so and then electing to drive away from the court house.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Taking into account the information provided today and the records presented during the course of the trial in these matters . . .</block_quote>

The court then proceeded to sentence the defendant.

An abuse of discretion is found only when the sentencing court exercises its discretion on grounds or for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable. <italic>Privitt,</italic><cross_reference>571 N.W.2d at 486</cross_reference>. A court's sentencing decision carries a strong presumption in its favor. <italic>State v. Cheatheam,</italic><cross_reference>569 N.W.2d 820</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>821</cross_reference> (Iowa 1997). We determine any interaction between the court and the defendant's attorney during trial did not carry over to the defendant's sentencing. The court considered the relevant factors in sentencing and stated these on the record. The district court did not abuse its discretion at sentencing. Defendant was not denied a fair trial or a fair sentencing.

<bold>III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</bold>. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing is preserved for future proceedings. We decline to decide this issue on direct appeal. Ordinarily, ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised on direct appeal are preserved for postconviction proceedings to allow full development of the facts surrounding counsel's conduct.<italic>State v. Atley,</italic> <cross_reference>564 N.W.2d 817</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>833</cross_reference> (Iowa 1997).
