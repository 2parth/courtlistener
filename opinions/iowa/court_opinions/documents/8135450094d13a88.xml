<opinion_text>  Robert Blubaugh appeals from the declaratory ruling and ruling on his motion to amend or modify the declaratory ruling concerning the division of his pension. He contends the ruling changed the terms of the parties' decree of dissolution of marriage concerning property distribution, it divides assets accumulated after the dissolution, and it improperly determined Patricia is entitled to surviving spouse pension benefits.

Our review is de novo. Iowa R. App. P. 6.4. We have reviewed the district court's thorough, detailed, and well-reasoned ruling regarding the issues raised on appeal. We conclude the district court correctly decided the issues, and we cannot significantly add to a discussion of those issues. We adopt the trial court's ruling as our own and affirm. <italic>See</italic>
Iowa R. App. P. 6.24(1).

<bold>AFFIRMED.</bold>
