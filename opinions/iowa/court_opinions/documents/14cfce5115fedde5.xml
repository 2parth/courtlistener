<opinion_text>  Appellant, Douglas Thieleke, challenges the district court's ruling and order on his motion to controvert answers and motion for judgment against garnishee, First American Bank. He contends the bank waived its right of setoff against accounts held by judgment debtors by its actions inconsistent with that right. The bank claims appellant did not preserve error on his claim. We affirm.

In October 2001, appellant obtained judgments against Central Iowa Machining Company, Inc. (CIMCO) and its president, Donald Boeckholt. Both CIMCO and Boeckholt had accounts at First American Bank. In conjunction with the loan from the bank to CIMCO, the company executed a security agreement and a note in favor of the bank. The documents listed CIMCO's accounts as collateral for the loan and provided for various remedies such as acceleration or set-off upon default. Prior to the actions at issue here, CIMCO made partial payments on the judgment to appellant from its account at the bank.

On the afternoon of Friday, March 29, 2002, appellant served the bank with a notice of garnishment and interrogatories, listing "Central Iowa Machine Co/Boeckholt, D" as judgment debtor and seeking payment of the judgments from a listed account number and "any  all accts." On April 1, the bank honored checks totaling nearly $40,000 to creditors other than appellant. It also allowed Boeckholt to transfer $10,000 from CIMCO's account to his personal account.

The garnishment notice was routed to the bank's security officer, who stamped it "received" on April 2. The security officer then contacted the loan officer on the loan and was told the funds in CIMCO's account were for receivables and could not be used to satisfy the garnishment. On April 2, the bank set off CIMCO's debt on the loan against the funds remaining in CIMCO's account, leaving a zero balance. The bank responded to the notice of garnishment that no funds were available. After April 2, but during the term of the garnishment, the bank advanced loans to CIMCO to cover checks written on CIMCO's account.

In July 2002 appellant filed a motion to controvert answers and motion for judgment against garnishee bank. The bank filed its resistance in August and a hearing was held later that month. In its ruling and order, filed in September, the court stated the issue as "whether the garnishment or the ensuing setoff which was not exercised until the garnishment was executed should be given priority." After noting the bank's right of setoff in the loan documents and under common law in Iowa, the court restated the issue as "the timing of the exercise of the setoff, and more specifically, whether or not it is too late after the garnishment has been executed." The court concluded the bank had the right to exercise its setoff against CIMCO's account under these circumstances. The court also entered judgment against the bank for the amount that was in Boeckholt's personal account at the time of the garnishment.

Our review is for correction of errors at law. Iowa R.App.P. 6.4. Appellant frames the issue as "whether [the bank] waived its right of setoff" because it took actions inconsistent with that right. The bank responds that appellant has not preserved error because the issue of waiver was not raised in or decided by the district court. "Issues must ordinarily be presented to and passed upon by the trial court before they may be raised and adjudicated on appeal." <italic>Benavides v. J.C. Penney Life</italic><italic>Ins. Co.</italic>, <cross_reference>539 N.W.2d 352</cross_reference>, 356 (Iowa 1995). Appellant contends the issue was raised before the district court in chambers and in his trial brief. The discussions in chambers were not reported. The trial brief was not filed and made a part of the record. Even if the claim was raised in the district court, it was not ruled on by the court, so is not preserved for our review. <italic>See State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Pflibsen</italic>, <cross_reference>350 N.W.2d 202</cross_reference>, 206 (Iowa 1984) (noting a motion to amend or enlarge is essential to preserve error if a trial court does not resolve an issue).

Having concluded appellant did not preserve his claim for our review, we affirm the decision of the district court.
