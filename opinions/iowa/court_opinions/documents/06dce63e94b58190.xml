<opinion_text><unpublished>  <bold><italic>I. Background Facts  Proceedings</italic></bold>

Ronald and Tracy are the parents of Brandon, who was born in April 1997. Ronald has a lengthy history of alcohol abuse. There was also extensive domestic abuse in the family. In November 2002 Tracy stabbed Ronald and was sent to prison.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> The next day, Ronald was arrested for operating while intoxicated (OWI), third offense,<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> and was placed in jail. Because both of his parents were incarcerated, Brandon was placed in foster care.

Brandon was adjudicated to be a child in need of assistance (CINA), pursuant to Iowa Code sections <cross_reference>232.2</cross_reference>(6)(c)(2) (2003) (child is likely to suffer harm due to parent's failure to supervise) and (n) (parent's alcohol abuse results in child not receiving adequate care). Ronald was sentenced to a residential correctional facility based on the OWI charge.

After Ronald was released from the facility, he cooperated with services, and in June 2004 Brandon was placed in his care. In November 2004 while Brandon was a passenger, Ronald drove while intoxicated and hit another vehicle. Ronald was arrested for OWI, third offense;<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference> driving while barred; and child endangerment. Brandon was removed from Ronald's care and returned to foster care. Ronald pled guilty and was sentenced to prison for five years.

In March 2005 the State filed a petition seeking the termination of Ronald's parental rights. The juvenile court terminated Ronald's parental rights under sections <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(d) (2005) (child CINA for neglect, circumstances continue despite the receipt of services), (f) (child four or older, CINA, removed for at least twelve months, and cannot be returned home), and (l) (child CINA, parent has substance abuse problem, child cannot be returned within a reasonable time).<footnote_reference>[fn4]</footnote_reference> In considering Brandon's best interests, the juvenile court found, "Brandon needs a safe and stable home in which to grow up. He needs a family now that can provide for his physical and emotional needs on a daily basis with predictability." Ronald appeals the termination of his parental rights.

<bold><italic>II. Standard of Review</italic></bold>

The scope of review in termination cases is de novo. <italic>In re</italic><italic>C.B.</italic>, <cross_reference>611 N.W.2d 489</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>492</cross_reference> (Iowa 2000). The grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. <italic>In</italic><italic>re T.B.</italic>, <cross_reference>604 N.W.2d 660</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>661</cross_reference> (Iowa 2000). Our primary concern is the best interests of the child. <italic>In re J.L.W.</italic>, <cross_reference>570 N.W.2d 778</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>780</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct.App. 1997).

<bold><italic>III. Best Interests</italic></bold>

Ronald concedes that there are statutory grounds to terminate his parental rights. However, he claims that it is not in Brandon's best interests to terminate his rights. Ronald points out that he and Brandon have a close bond.

Due to Ronald's drinking, he placed Brandon in a dangerous situation and was charged with child endangerment. Ronald also does not recognize the toll his actions, the drinking and the domestic violence, have taken on Brandon. Brandon has been in counseling since the juvenile case began, and he has also participated in an intensive outpatient program for behavior modification and social skills. Brandon's psychologist reported that although Brandon had a strong bond with his father, he needed permanency. He asked his foster parents, "When am I going to be adopted?" and stated that he wanted to continue to live with them.

We conclude termination of Ronald's parental rights is in Brandon's best interests. We affirm the decision of the juvenile court.

<bold>AFFIRMED.</bold>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Tracy later voluntarily agreed to termination of her parental rights.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> This was Ronald's fourth conviction for OWI.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn3]</footnote_number> This was actually his fifth offense.</footnote_body>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn4]</footnote_number> The termination order also relies upon Iowa Code ยง<cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(m).
