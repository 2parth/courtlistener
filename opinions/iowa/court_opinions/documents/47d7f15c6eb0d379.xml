<opinion_text>  Natural mother appeals an order granting custody of her child, Robert, age seven, to the widow of her ex-husband.

Upon our de novo review, giving deference to the trial court's credibility findings and applying a best interest of the child standard, we conclude the appellee has overcome the presumption in favor of the natural parent. The boy's only home has been that of his father and step-mother. We affirm the trial court's custody decision.

<bold>AFFIRMED.</bold>
