<opinion_text>  Jackie S. and Casey W. appeal the termination of their parental rights to their daughter, A.W.

<center>                  <bold><italic>I. Background Facts and Proceedings</italic></bold>.</center>
A.W. was born on March 16, 2001. She first came to the attention of the Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) on April 25, 2001 when she was brought to the hospital with nonaccidental injuries, including a fractured femur, clavicle, and rib; cigarette burns to the chin; a laceration on the upper gum line; and a number of serious bruises. The parties stipulated that A.W. was a child in need of assistance on the ground that A.W. had "suffered or is imminently likely to suffer harmful effects as a result of . . . [t]he failure of the child's parent . . . to exercise a reasonable degree of care in supervising the child" pursuant to Iowa Code section <cross_reference>232.2</cross_reference>(6)(c) (2001). A.W. was removed from her parents' care and placed with the DHS for placement in foster care.

On May 3, 2001, Jackie and Casey were charged with felony child endangerment and subsequently held in the Lee County Correctional Facility pending the posting of bond. Each parent pled guilty to the crimes charged. Jackie was sentenced to a two-year indeterminate term, which was suspended. She was placed on probation for a period not to exceed two years. Casey was sentenced to a five-year indeterminate sentence, which was also suspended. He was placed on probation for five years. As a term of his probation, Casey was required to reside at a correctional facility for 365 days or until maximum benefits had been achieved.

The State's subsequent petition to terminate Jackie's and Casey's parental rights pursuant to section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j) (Supp. 2001)<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> (child adjudicated CINA, parent imprisoned for crime against child) was granted on January 18, 2002.

On appeal Jackie and Casey assert that the State failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, citing its failure to include a list of services offered to preserve the family in its petition for termination of parental rights as required in section<cross_reference>232.111</cross_reference>(4)(e) (Supp. 2001). They also contend termination was improper because the State failed to prove the grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence or to provide services to promote reunification.

<center>                         <bold><italic>II. Standard of Review</italic></bold>.</center>
Termination proceedings are reviewed de novo. <italic>In re C.B</italic>.,<cross_reference>611 N.W.2d 489</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>492</cross_reference> (Iowa 2000). The primary concern in termination proceedings is the best interests of the child. <italic>Id</italic>. The State has the burden to prove the allegations of the petition by clear and convincing evidence. Iowa Code ยง <cross_reference>232.96</cross_reference> (2001).

<center>                    <bold><italic>III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</italic></bold>.</center>
Iowa Code section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j) allows the termination of parental rights upon proof of the following elements:

<block_quote>  (1) The child has been adjudicated a child in need of assistance pursuant to section <cross_reference>232.96</cross_reference> and custody has been transferred from the child's parents for placement pursuant to section <cross_reference>232.102</cross_reference>.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  (2) The parent has been imprisoned for a crime against the child . . . or the parent has been imprisoned and it is unlikely that the parent will be released from prison for a period of five or more years.</block_quote>

Iowa Code ยง <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j) (Supp. 2001). Jackie and Casey argue that termination was improper under this code section because neither had been imprisoned for a crime against their child. Because the parties disagree as to the meaning of the phrase "imprisoned for a crime against the child," we turn to the rules of statutory interpretation.

In interpreting statutes, our ultimate goal is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature. <italic>Lockhart v. Ceder</italic><italic>Rapids Cmty. Sch. Dist</italic>., <cross_reference>577 N.W.2d 845</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>847</cross_reference> (Iowa 1998). We seek a reasonable interpretation that will best affect the purpose of the statute and avoid an absurd result. <italic>American Asbestos Training</italic><italic>Ctr. Ltd., v. E. Iowa Cmty. Coll.,</italic> <cross_reference>463 N.W.2d 56</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>58</cross_reference> (Iowa 1990). We consider all portions of the statute together, without attributing undue importance to any single or isolated portion.<italic>Id</italic>. When more than one statute is pertinent to the inquiry, we consider the statutes together in an attempt to harmonize them.<italic>Harden v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>434 N.W.2d 881</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>884</cross_reference> (Iowa 1989).

Legislative intent is ascertained based on the words used in the statute. <italic>Lockhart,</italic> <cross_reference>577 N.W.2d at 847</cross_reference>. "When the text of a statute is plain and its meaning clear, the court should not search for a meaning beyond the express terms of the statute or resort to rules of construction." <italic>Henriksen v. Younglove Constr.,</italic> <cross_reference>540 N.W.2d 254</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>258</cross_reference> (Iowa 1995). On the other hand, when the language of the statute is ambiguous, we use rules of statutory interpretation to assist us in ascertaining legislative intent. <italic>See State v. Ahitow</italic>,<cross_reference>544 N.W.2d 270</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>272</cross_reference> (Iowa 1996). A statute is ambiguous when reasonable minds differ or are uncertain as to its meaning. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. White</italic>, <cross_reference>545 N.W.2d 552</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>555</cross_reference> (Iowa 1996).

Black's Law Dictionary provides the following definition of the word imprison:

<block_quote>  To put in a prison; to put in a place of confinement. To confine a person, or restrain his liberty, in any way.</block_quote>

Black's Law Dictionary, 757 (6th ed. 1990). Based on this definition, the State argues that the period of time the parents were confined in the county correctional facility prior to their plea proceeding constitutes imprisonment. It contends that this conclusion is supported by the legislative intent underlying the code section, which it asserts is to allow termination of parental rights without waiting a requisite period of time whenever a parent commits a crime against his or her child so heinous that it results in imprisonment. Jackie and Casey conversely contend that this subsection is intended to allow termination when, due to imprisonment, a parent is unavailable or unable to fulfill his or her parental obligations.

We find that the term "imprisoned" is not ambiguous, and give it its ordinary meaning. We conclude that, for purposes of this code section, "imprisoned for a crime against the child" requires a parent be confined at the time of termination as a result of his or her conviction of a crime against the child.<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference> We believe that adoption of the State's position that preconviction confinement constitutes imprisonment for a crime against a child would fail to affect the purpose of the statute and could lead to absurd results.

In the instant case, we conclude that Casey's term of confinement in Burlington Residential Correctional Facility, which he was serving at the time of the termination hearing, constitutes imprisonment for a crime against the child. We accordingly find that the State met its burden of proof under section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j) and affirm on this issue.

Jackie, on the other hand, was not confined by the department of corrections following her conviction of child endangerment. We therefore conclude that the State failed to meet its burden to terminate Jackie's parental rights pursuant to section<cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j). Because the State failed to plead or attempt to prove termination was proper under any other code section, we must reverse the district court's order terminating Jackie's parental rights and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The remainder of this decision addresses Casey's arguments only, as the above is dispositive of Jackie's claims.

<center>                        <bold><italic>IV. Termination Petition</italic></bold>.</center>
Casey also argues that termination was improper because the petition to terminate his parental rights failed to include a list of services offered to preserve the family unit, as required in Iowa Code section <cross_reference>232.111</cross_reference>(4)(e) (2001). He contends that "[b]y not listing these services, the State is acquiescing in the idea that no required services were performed by the Department of Human Services or the State." Casey cites no authority to support this proposition, and we decline to adopt it. Even if we were to find otherwise, this conclusion is against the weight of the evidence, as the State presented testimony at the termination hearing as to a number of services offered and provided.

Casey further asserts that he was prejudiced by the State's omission in that it substantively affected his ability to prepare for the termination hearing. Casey fails, however, to specifically state how knowledge that the State planned to claim it offered a specific service would affect his defense. Moreover, upon our de novo review of the record, we conclude that Casey was provided sufficient notice of the services through the case permanency plan dated June 1, 2001. This plan outlined the following responsibilities for the DHS and Casey:

DHS:

<block_quote>  1) Will arrange for funding for the substance abuse and mental health evaluations for Jackie and Casey if other resources are unavailable.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2) Will have face to face contact with [A.W.] on a monthly or bi-monthly basis as the case indicates.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3) Will arrange for supervised visitation with [A.W.] for Casey and Jackie at the discretion of DHS.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  4) Will keep the Guardian Ad Litem informed of case progress or lack of it.</block_quote>

Casey:

<block_quote>  1) Prior to visitation privileges, Casey will submit to a substance abuse evaluation upon the release from incarceration.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  2) Prior to visitation privileges, Casey will submit to a mental health evaluation upon the release from incarceration.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  3) Will follow through with all recommendations of the substance [abuse] and mental health evaluations.</block_quote>

4) Will submit to random UA's at the discretion of DHS.

<block_quote>  5) Will be available for supervised visitation at the discretion of DHS.</block_quote>

We find nothing in the record to indicate that the State claimed to have offered any services at trial beyond those listed in the case permanency plan.

We further note that although section <cross_reference>232.111</cross_reference>(4)(e) states that a petition for termination of parental rights should include a list of services offered; this requirement is not constitutionally mandated. While the parent-child relationship is constitutionally protected, the State's obligation is to meet due process requirements, which include giving a parent sufficient notice of the complaint and the time of the hearing. <italic>In re D.E.D.,</italic><cross_reference>476 N.W.2d 737</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>739</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct.App. 1991). We believe notice in this case complied with these requirements.

The district court is affirmed on this issue.

<center>                     <bold><italic>V. Reasonableness of Services</italic></bold>.</center>
Finally, Casey argues that termination was improper because the State provided no services to promote reunification. As mentioned above, Casey was provided notice of the services available to him. Because he failed to challenge or object to the services provided at the removal or review hearing, this issue is not preserved for our review. <italic>In re L.M.W</italic>., <cross_reference>518 N.W.2d 804</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>807</cross_reference> (Iowa Ct.App. 1994). Parents have a responsibility to demand services prior to the termination hearing. <italic>Id</italic>.

<center>                              <bold><italic>VI. Summary</italic></bold>.</center>
The district court decision terminating Jackie's parental rights is reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this decision. The court's decision terminating Casey's parental rights is affirmed in its entirety.

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn2]</footnote_number> In reviewing the remaining portions of the statute, we take particular note of section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(m), which provides for termination of a parent's rights following a child in need of assistance adjudication on the basis of physical or sexual abuse and a felony conviction and imprisonment for abusing the child. We believe that if we were to interpret section <cross_reference>232.116</cross_reference>(1)(j) as the State requests, there would be no distinction in the practical application of these two subsections. <italic>See Miller v.
