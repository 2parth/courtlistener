<bold><italic>Background Facts and Proceedings.</italic></bold>

On July 3, 2000, Stephen was charged by trial information with four counts, to wit: possession of muriatic acid as a precursor to the manufacture of methamphetamine in violation of Iowa Code section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(4) (count I); possession of lithium as a precursor to the manufacture of methamphetamine in violation of Iowa Code section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(4) (count II); possession of anhydrous ammonia as a precursor to the manufacture of methamphetamine in violation of Iowa Code section <cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(4) (count III); and possession of methamphetamine in violation of Iowa Code section<cross_reference>124.401</cross_reference>(1)(b)(7) (count IV). These charges resulted from the execution of a search warrant on June 28, 2000.

The search warrant was issued on a Chevrolet pickup being driven by Stephen. The warrant was executed at 5:35 p.m. on June 28, 2000. A copy of the search warrant was placed inside the pickup at the time the search commenced. After the search, Deputy John Halferty incorrectly stated on the return that the warrant was issued on June 29, 2000, the day after the search. It is clear from the record the search warrant was actually issued on June 28, and Deputy Halferty's actions were simply a scrivener's error. This conclusion is supported by and confirmed in the complaint, search warrant property report, and minutes of testimony.

Stephen was initially appointed counsel but decided to retain his own attorney. That attorney filed a motion to suppress based upon the claim Stephen's vehicle was searched without law enforcement first obtaining a warrant. This attorney later withdrew, and Stephen was once again appointed counsel. The record is clear there was no disposition on the motion to suppress. Apparently both counsel argued with Stephen that the motion was ill-advised.

Counts I and IV were later dismissed on the State's own motion. Stephen then reached a plea agreement on the remaining charges. Under said agreement, he would plead to count II, and the State would dismiss count III.

Stephen entered his plea of guilty to count II on September 5, 2000. During the plea proceeding, he admitted to possessing lithium with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine. At the time of said plea, he was already serving a prison sentence for parole violation. It is clear from the plea colloquy that Stephen was intent on receiving the benefit of this plea agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Stephen could insure that count III would be dismissed, the State would not pursue any habitual criminal charges against him,<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> and that his five-year sentence under count II would run concurrent with the sentence he was already serving for parole violation. Stephen took an active part in the plea proceeding and even clarified the terms of the plea agreement for the presiding judge. No request was made for a ruling on the motion to suppress. Stephen did not file a motion in arrest of judgment or a direct appeal. Instead, he took advantage of the benefit of his plea agreement and served the concurrent sentences.

Subsequent to these proceedings, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned a 1998 conviction which was unrelated to the instant case. However, this conviction had been one of the two prior felonies which made possible any habitual criminal charges in this case. On September 25, 2002, Stephen filed his pro se application for postconviction relief. An attorney was appointed to represent him. Following hearing, the district court denied the application on October 10, 2003. Stephen appeals.

<bold><italic>Standard of Review.</italic></bold>

We typically review postconviction relief proceedings on error.<italic>Osborn v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>573 N.W.2d 917</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>920</cross_reference> (Iowa 1998). However, when the applicant asserts claims of a constitutional nature, our review is de novo. <italic>Id.</italic> Thus, we review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. <italic>State v. Oetken,</italic> <cross_reference>613 N.W.2d 679</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>683</cross_reference> (Iowa 2000); <italic>State v. Carrillo,</italic> <cross_reference>597 N.W.2d 497</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>499</cross_reference> (Iowa 1999); <italic>State v. Mapp,</italic> <cross_reference>585 N.W.2d 746</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>747</cross_reference> (Iowa 1998);<italic>Osborn,</italic> <cross_reference>573 N.W.2d at 920</cross_reference>. In addition, we give weight to the lower court's findings concerning witness credibility. Iowa R. App. P. 6.14(6)(g); <italic>Taylor v. State,</italic> <cross_reference>352 N.W.2d 683</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>687</cross_reference> (Iowa 1984).

<bold><italic>Waiver.</italic></bold>

Stephen asserts his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to secure a ruling on his motion to suppress. He also asserts his postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to amend his pro se application. We reject both claims.

The State argues on appeal Stephen waived his claims by pleading guilty, failing to file a motion in arrest of judgment, and failing to file a direct appeal. The district court did deny Stephen's application on procedural grounds. Specifically, the district court found that he waived two of his claims by entering his plea of guilty and that his other claim failed because he "did not preserve this argument by bringing it on direct appeal nor did he provide `sufficient reason' or `cause' for not directly appealing this issue."

We agree with the reasoning of the State and the district court. However, we feel compelled to speak to the merits of this issue.

<bold><italic>Merits.</italic></bold>

The basis of Stephen's postconviction relief action and subsequent appeal lies with the failure of his two trial counsel to seek a ruling on a frivolous motion to suppress. The State alleges Stephen misunderstands the import of a scrivener's error. We disagree. We conclude he fully understands the import of a scrivener's error and fully understands this <italic>was</italic> a scrivener's error. Instead, he is intent on playing the system for his own benefit.

The evidence is overwhelming that law enforcement officers obtained a search warrant prior to searching the Chevrolet pickup. The complaint, search warrant property report, and minutes of testimony all support this fact. So does the evidence that a copy of the search warrant was placed inside the pickup at the beginning of the search. Deputy Halferty simply made a mistake in the return to the warrant when he stated the wrong date.

Additionally, a review of the record makes it clear that Stephen was intent on seeking the benefit of the generous plea agreement offered by the State. His plea of guilty would insure dismissal of the remaining felony count, would prevent the State from filing any habitual criminal charges, and would insure the very minimum prison time. The district court recognized this fact when it made the following observation at the postconviction relief hearing:

<block_quote>  THE COURT: So what the defendant is stating to this Court, in essence, is that even though he consciously made a decision to plead based upon the fact that by pleading, he would not do any more time than he was already going to do because the county attorney had agreed to run the sentence concurrently with a parole violation sentence that he had and that by doing so, he was effectively cutting off any possibility of having habitual violator charges filed on him in the event that he lost his argument on the Motion to Suppress, and even though he made those decisions, he still thinks that he can come back here now and take a second shot based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, i.e., not going ahead with the Motion to Suppress. Isn't that a little bit inconsistent?</block_quote>

Approximately two years after his plea, Stephen learned that the Iowa Supreme Court had reversed an earlier unrelated case. This unrelated case would have been the second felony supporting any habitual offender charge in the instant case. Then, and only then, did he file for postconviction relief. Stephen testified as follows at his postconviction relief hearing:

<block_quote>  Q. You didn't appeal this case; is that correct? A. Correct.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Q. And you gave up your right to file a Motion in Arrest of Judgment? A. Correct.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Q. Can you explain to the Court why you didn't appeal it? A. Okay. I filed the postconviction — I had a 1998 case which the Supreme Court overturned, which was the Jasper County's second felony conviction against me which would have made this case eligible for habitual offender.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Q. So what you're telling us is that at the time that you were charged with this, you had two prior convictions? A. Correct.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Q. But the second of those convictions has since been overturned? A. Correct.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Q. When did that happen; do you recall? A. August either 12<superscript>th</superscript> or 22<superscript>nd</superscript>, 2002.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Q. And that's when you filed your application for — A. Correct.</block_quote>

The district court concluded that Stephen had had the full benefit of his plea bargain and should not now be allowed to take a "second shot" based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. While we agree, we go further and conclude his claims are without merit. His "inconsistent" position is not only an attempt to overturn the instant case for his benefit, but is also an attempt to preclude the use of the instant case as a qualifying felony, thereby insulating himself from habitual criminal charges in the future.
