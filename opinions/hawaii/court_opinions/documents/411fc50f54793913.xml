<opinion_text><center>                  <italic>ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</italic></center>
Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration of the August 28, 2000 order dismissing appeal, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that the motion for reconsideration is untimely because it was received and filed at the supreme court on September 25, 2000, more than ten days after the filing of the August 28, 2000 order. <italic>See</italic> HRAP 40(a). Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for reconsideration is denied.
