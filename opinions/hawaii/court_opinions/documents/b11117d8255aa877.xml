</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Upon consideration of Petitioners' petition for a writ of mandamus or other appropriate relief, the joinder in the petition, and the records and files herein, it appears that: (1) Petitioners seek review of the judgment entered in <underline>Kelly v. 1250</underline><underline>Oceanside Partners</underline>, Civil No. 00-1-0192K; (2) the judgment entered <underline>Kelly v. 1250 Oceanside Partners</underline>, is the subject of Appeal No. 26813; and (3) Petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to a writ of mandamus. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied without prejudice to Petitioners seeking leave to file an amicus curiae brief in Appeal No. 26813.
