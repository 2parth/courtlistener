<opinion_text><center>                           <underline>ORDER OF DISMISSAL</underline></center>
Upon consideration of the complaint filed on November 24, 2008, the amended complaint filed on November 26, 2008, and the motions to dismiss the complaints, it appears that the complaints are styled as election contests brought pursuant to HRS §§ <cross_reference>11-172</cross_reference> (1993) and <cross_reference>11-174.5</cross_reference> (Supp. 2007), but the complaints challenge candidate Solomon Kahoohalahala's qualifications to be a member of the Maui County Council. Any challenge to a candidate's qualifications for county office must be pursued in accordance with HRS § <cross_reference>12-8</cross_reference> (Supp. 2007), not HRS §§ <cross_reference>11-172</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>11-174.5</cross_reference>. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 24, 2008 complaint and the November 26, 2008 amended complaint are dismissed.

DATED: Honolulu, Hawai'i, December 15, 2008.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
