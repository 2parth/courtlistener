Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus filed by petitioner Matthew Yasuhara and the papers in support, it appears that bail after conviction of a felony is not a matter of right after revocation of probation and before resentencing. <underline>See</underline> HRS §§ <cross_reference>804-4</cross_reference> and<cross_reference>706-626</cross_reference>(2) (Supp. 2008). Therefore, petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief and petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. <underline>See</underline> <underline>Kema v. Gaddis</underline>, <cross_reference>91 Hawai'i 200</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>204</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>982 P.2d 334</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>338</cross_reference> (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). Accordingly,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.
