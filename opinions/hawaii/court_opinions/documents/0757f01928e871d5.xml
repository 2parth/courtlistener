<opinion_text>  Upon review of the record, it appears that this court informed Appellants by letter dated May 2, 2003 that the time for filing the opening brief expired on April 19, 2003 and that, pursuant to Rule 30 of the Hawai`i Rules of Appellate Procedure, the matter would be called to the attention of the court for such action as the court deemed proper including dismissal of the appeal. Appellants having failed to respond to said letter or to otherwise oppose dismissal,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed.
