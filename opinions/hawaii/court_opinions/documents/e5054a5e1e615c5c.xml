Defendant-Appellant Thomas Kassell has submitted "claims of error" by which he seeks review of the March 15, 2000, memorandum opinion of the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Decisions of the Intermediate Court of Appeals may be reviewed upon application for a writ of certiorari. <italic>See</italic> HRS ยง <cross_reference>602-59</cross_reference>. Thus, we consider Appellant Kassell's submission as an application for a writ of certiorari. Applications for writs of certiorari must be filed within thirty days after the filing of the decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals. <italic>See</italic> HRS ยง <cross_reference>602-59</cross_reference>(c). In this case, the Intermediate Court of Appeals decision was filed March 15, 2000, the time for filing an application for a writ of certiorari expired on April 14, 2000, and we lack jurisdiction to entertain Appellant Kassel's application. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Kassel's application for a writ of certiorari is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
