Upon consideration of the record, it appears that (1) Respondent Herman H.M. Ling is the subject of an investigation by Disciplinary Counsel, (2) Respondent Ling has failed to cooperate with Counsel's investigation, (3) Respondent Ling was served, pursuant to Rule 2.12A(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai`i, with our February 10, 2003 order to show cause as to why he should not be suspended from the practice of law, and (4) Respondent Ling has failed to respond to our February 10, 2003 order to show cause as to why he should not be suspended from the practice of law. Respondent Ling, having failed to cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel's investigation and having failed to comply with a lawful demand of this court is, therefore, guilty of failing to cooperate with the disciplinary investigation. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 2.12A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai`i, that Respondent Herman H.M. Ling is suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction, effective immediately and until further order of this court.
