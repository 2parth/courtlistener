</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Upon consideration of Petitioner Terry Michael Turner's petition for a writ of mandamus, the papers in support, and the records and files herein, it appears that: (1) Petitioner is seeking a writ directing the Hawaii Paroling Authority to release him on parole; (2) a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. <italic>Barnett v. Broderick,</italic> <cross_reference>84 Haw. 109</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>111</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>929 P.2d 1359</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1361</cross_reference> (1996) (citing <italic>Straub Clinic  Hospital v.</italic><italic>Kochi,</italic> <cross_reference>81 Haw. 410</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>414</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>917 P.2d 1284</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1288</cross_reference> (1996)); (3) mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual's claim is clear and certain, the official's duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available. <italic>Barnett,</italic><cross_reference>84 Hawai`i at 111</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>929 P.2d at 1361</cross_reference> (citing <italic>Azurin v. Von Raab,</italic> <cross_reference>803 F.2d 9993</cross_reference> (9th Cir. 1986) <italic>cert. denied,</italic> <cross_reference>483 U.S. 1021</cross_reference> (1987)); and (4) Petitioner has an alternative to a writ of mandamus, <italic>see</italic> <italic>Turner v. Hawaii Paroling</italic><italic>Authority,</italic> <cross_reference>93 Haw. 298</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1 P.3d 768</cross_reference> (App. 2000), and he fails to demonstrate that he is entitled to mandamus relief. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.
