Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel's petition for issuance of reciprocal discipline notice to Respondent Steven B. Johnson, pursuant to Rule 2.15(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai'i ("RSCH"), the memorandum, affidavit, and exhibits thereto, Respondent Johnson's response thereto, and the record, it appears that:

(1) on August 31, 2006, the Supreme Court of Oregon suspended Respondent Johnson for ninety (90) days for his violation of DR 5-105(E) (current client conflict of interest); DR 6-101(B) (neglect of a legal matter); DR 9-101(A) (failure to deposit or maintain client funds in trust) (3 counts); DR 9-101(C) (3) (failure to account for client funds or property) (3 counts); RPC 1.3 (neglect of a legal matter); RPC 1.4(a) (failure to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter) (2 counts); RPC 1.4(b) (failure to communicate with a client sufficiently to allow a client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); and RPC 8.1(a)(2) (failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority) of the Oregon Code of Professional Conduct and the<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
Oregon Rules of Professional Responsibility;

(2) RSCH 2.15(b) requires the same or substantially equivalent discipline, or restrictions or conditions upon the attorney's license to practice law in the State of Hawai'i, unless Respondent Johnson shall show cause under RSCH 2.15(c) as to why imposition of the same or substantially equivalent discipline should not be imposed;

(3) Respondent Johnson filed a response to our September 4, 2007 notice and order on October 19, 2007 that fails to show cause;

(4) a same discipline is warranted in this jurisdiction; and

(5) a same discipline in this jurisdiction is suspension for ninety (90) days. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Steven B. Johnson is suspended from the practice of law in the State of Hawai'i for ninety days effective 30 days after entry of this order, as provided by RSCH 2.16(c).

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Johnson's reinstatement in the State of Hawai'i is conditioned (1) upon payment of all costs of this proceeding, and (2) full reinstatement to the practice of law in Oregon.<page_number>Page 1</page_number>
