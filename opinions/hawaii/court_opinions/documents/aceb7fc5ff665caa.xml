Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel's petition for issuance of reciprocal discipline notice to Respondent Richard A. Williams, pursuant to Rule 2.15(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai'i (RSCH), the memorandum, affidavit, and exhibits appended thereto, and the record, it appears that:

(1) on May 23, 2007, the Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk, of the State of Connecticut, suspended Respondent Richard A. Williams from the practice of law in Connecticut for a period of four years and nine months retroactive to January 31, 2003;

(2) RSCH 2.15(b) requires the equivalent or substantially equivalent order in this state, <underline>see</underline> RSCH 2.15(b), unless Respondent Williams shall show cause under RSCH 2.15(c) as to why imposition of the same or substantially equivalent discipline should not be imposed;

(3) Respondent Williams has not filed a response to our February 13, 2008 notice and order; and<page_number>Page 2</page_number>

(4) the equivalent discipline is warranted in this jurisdiction, pursuant to RSCH 2.15(c).

The record further shows that Respondent Williams was suspended on December 1, 2003, has not been reinstated, and should have no Hawai'i practice to wind down. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Richard A. Williams is suspended for four years and nine months, effective upon entry of this order.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Williams' reinstatement in the State of Hawai'i is conditioned (1) upon payment of all costs of this proceeding, (2) compliance with RSCH 2.16(b), and (3) Respondent Williams' reinstatement to the practice of law in Connecticut.
