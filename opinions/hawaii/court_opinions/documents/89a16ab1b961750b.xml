Upon consideration of Petitioner Llewellyn K. Wailehua's application for a writ of mandamus and prohibition directed to a public official, the papers in support, and the records and files herein, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that he is entitled to a writ of mandamus or prohibition. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied without prejudice to any remedy Petitioner may have in the underlying circuit court case.
