<opinion_text><center>                   <underline>ORDER OF TRANSFER TO ACTIVE STATUS</underline> <underline>AND RESUMPTION OF DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS</underline></center>
Upon consideration of the Affidavit of Charles H. Hite Regarding November 26, 2007 Order, the "Report Complex Evaluation Re: Christopher S. B. Woo," the report submitted by Robert C. Marvit, M.D., the medical expert appointed by the court to examine Respondent Woo, the Supplemental Declaration of Pamela O'Leary Tower in Support of the Affidavit of Charles H. Hite, the exhibits in support, and the record, it appears: (1) on March 23, 2007, we (i) transferred Respondent Woo to inactive status pursuant to RSCH 2.19(c) until a determination could be made of Respondent Woo's capacity to continue the practice of law, (ii) ordered that disciplinary investigations could continue, and (iii) ordered pending disciplinary proceedings against Respondent Woo be held in abeyance while Respondent Woo remained on inactive status pursuant to RSCH 2.19(c); (2) on November 26, 2007, we appointed Robert C. Marvit, M.D. to examine Respondent Woo and his medical records to determine whether Respondent Woo was incapacitated from continuing the practice of law; and (3) on April 21, 2008, we received Dr. Marvit's February 12, 2008<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
examination report that found Respondent Woo is not suffering from a substantial impairing mood disorder or cognitive dysfunction that would preclude his transfer to active status, and that determined Respondent Woo is competent to defend himself in disciplinary proceedings. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH 2.19(c), that Respondent Woo is returned to active status, with entry of this order.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel may resume disciplinary proceedings against Respondent Woo, including proceedings identified as ODC Nos. 07-025-8485, 07-026-8486, and 07-027-8487.
