Upon review of the record, it appears that (1) this court informed Appellants Pete Cabanayan Corpuz and Fortunata Garcia Corpuz by letter dated June 29, 2001, that the time for filing Appellants' Statement of Jurisdiction expired on June 8, 2001; (2) this court further informed Appellants by letter dated July 27, 2001, that the time for filing the opening brief expired on July 8, 2001, and, that, pursuant to Rule 30 of the Hawai`i Rules of Appellate Procedure, the matter would be called to the attention of the court for such action as the court deemed proper including dismissal of the appeal; and (3) Appellants have failed to respond to said letter or to otherwise oppose dismissal; therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed.
