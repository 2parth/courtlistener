</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  The mother (Mother) of two girls, one born on December 21, 1993 (Jane Doe II), and the other born on November 11, 1995 (Jane Doe III), appeals from the family court's November 14, 2001 Order Awarding Permanent Custody and Establishing a Permanent Plan. We affirm.

<center>                            RELEVANT STATUTES</center>
The relevant statutes are stated in footnote 1.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

<center>                               BACKGROUND</center>
Mother has six daughters. Only the youngest two have the same father. Mother is married but her husband (Husband) is not the father of any of her daughters.

<block_quote>  1975 or 1976             In her childhood, Mother was sexually abused. After running away from home and being raped at the age of 13 and in the eighth grade, Mother gave birth to a girl (First Half-Sister).</block_quote>

<block_quote>  1977 or 1978             At the age of 15, Mother gave birth to a girl (Second Half-Sister).</block_quote>

<block_quote>  1981 or 1982             Mother gave birth to a girl (Third Half-Sister).</block_quote>

January 20, 1984         Mother gave birth to a girl (Jane Doe I).

<block_quote>  April 21, 1992           In FC-S No. 92-011, the Department of Human Services of the State of Hawai`i (DHS) petitioned for Temporary Foster Custody of Jane Doe I. The petition noted that First Half-Sister, age 16, had been placed in the permanent custody of the DHS on or about February 6, 1992, that Second Half-Sister, age 15, had been placed in the foster custody of the DHS, and that Third Half-Sister, age 11, had been placed in the protective custody of the DHS on April 16, 1992, because Mother had inflicted severe physical harm upon her.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  April 22, 1992           Judge Ben H. Gaddis awarded Temporary Foster Custody of Jane Doe I to DHS.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  November 22, 1993        Judge Gaddis terminated the family court's jurisdiction in the case of Jane Doe I.</block_quote>

December 21, 1993        Mother gave birth to Jane Doe II.

November 11, 1995        Mother gave birth to Jane Doe III.

<block_quote>  February 10, 1997        In FC-S No. 92-011, the DHS petitioned for family supervision of Jane Doe I. The petition noted that Third Half-Sister, age 16, was in a therapeutic foster home. In FC-S No. 97-020, the DHS petitioned for family supervision of Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 27, 1997        Judge Gaddis entered an Order for Protection of Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III from their father (Father) and awarded temporary legal and physical custody of Jane Doe I, Jane Doe II, and Jane Doe III to Mother subject to family supervision by DHS.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  March 5, 1997            Judge Gaddis entered an order continuing temporary family supervision by the DHS.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  March 6, 1997            Judge Gaddis ordered the February 7, 1997 service plan into effect.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  March 31, 1998           Guardian Ad Litem Clayton E. Chong (GAL) reported that</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      [s]ocial worker Stuart Maeda called and stated that [Jane Doe I] was being physically abused by [Mother] two to three times a month and that it was increasing since the beginning of the school year to several times a week. According to Maeda, [Jane Doe I] was being hit on her arms and back area by [Mother's] open hand. Mother would call [Jane Doe I] names like "weakling, lazy, bitch, whore" and would be angry at her about not doing chores and not taking care of her younger sisters.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  April 1, 1998            In a Supplemental Safe Family Home Report, the DHS reported that</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      Mother has a long history with the DHS and Family Court. Interestingly, the GAL had predicted that problems would arise with [Jane Doe I] and Mother as [Jane Doe I] matured.</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      The DHS, like [Jane Doe I], wonders about the younger children, [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III], although for the time being it appears that the situation is safe given FSS [Family Support Services] involvement with the family.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  September 24, 1998       Judge Gaddis revoked DHS family supervision over Jane Doe I and awarded foster custody of Jane Doe I to DHS.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  October 19, 1998         Judge Gaddis ordered the October 6, 1998 service plan into effect.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  November 16, 1998        Judge Gaddis entered an order that Husband, who then was Mother's boyfriend and later became Mother's husband<footnote_reference>[fn2]</footnote_reference>, "agrees to participate in this proceeding as a party."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 1, 1999         Pursuant to a hearing on January 21, 1999, Judge Gaddis entered an order stating, "[Mother] informed the court that she has firm plans to move the family to West Virginia and [Mother] was notified that she may not take the children out of the county of Hawaii without the court's approval."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  August 16, 1999          Judge Gaddis entered an order reminding the Mother and Husband "that they shall not remove the children from the island of Hawaii without prior court approval[.]"</block_quote>

<block_quote>  September 17, 1999       Judge Gaddis ordered the July 21, 1999 service plan into effect. It continued the foster custody of Jane Doe I and the family supervision of Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III, and stated, in relevant part, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      Based upon the records and/or evidence presented and having fully considered all relevant prior and current information pertaining to the guidelines for determining whether the child/ren's family is willing and able to provide the child/ren with a safe family home, the court finds that:</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                      <italic>D</italic> The child/ren's family is presently willing and able to provide [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] with a safe family home, with the assistance of a service plan.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                      <italic>F</italic> Each party present at the hearing understands that unless the family is willing and able to provide the child/ren with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan within a reasonable period of time, that their respective parental and custodial rights shall be subject to termination[.]</block_quote>

<block_quote>  January 7, 2000          Without the knowledge or permission of the DHS, the GAL, or the Court, Mother and Husband departed Hawai`i with Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 7, 2000         The GAL reported that when Jane Doe I had last been seen by the DHS, "the child's legs and hands were shaking, and she did not look good" and recommended that "if [Mother] and [Husband] took [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] to the mainland despite the Court's previous warnings not to do so, that the [DHS] obtain foster custody of both children upon their return to Hawaii."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 9, 2000         The DHS filed a Safe Family Home Report stating, in relevant part, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      [Husband] has been mostly resistant to fully cooperate with DHS. Historically, he's had problems parenting his own teenage daughter and he's also had incidents of domestic violence with this child's mother (his previous wife). In discussions with the social worker [Husband] shows very little insight into the needs of the children or understanding of their development.</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      There is great concern at this time for the safety of [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] and warranted by the following reasons: 1) [Mother's] history of physical abuse of her children; 2) her inability to parent adolescents; 3) [Mother's] and [Husband's] continued use of corporal punishment on the younger children; 4) her apparent domestic difficulties with [Husband]; 5) her indifference to her older daughters; 6) the fact that she absconded with the younger children.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 14, 2000        Based on a February 10, 2000 hearing, Judge Gaddis, for Judge William S. Chillingworth, entered an order stating, in relevant part, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      <italic>D</italic> The child/ren's family is not presently willing and able to provide [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] with a safe family home, with the assistance of a service plan;</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                      <italic>F</italic> Three calls were made for [Mother] and [Husband] and they failed to appear.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                      Based on the foregoing considerations and findings, and good cause appearing therefor;</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      <italic>1</italic> Family supervision of [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] is revoked and DHS is awarded foster custody of [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III].</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                      <italic>8</italic> Bench warrants shall issue for Mother and [Husband].</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 24, 2000        The DHS informed the GAL that Jane Doe I "tested positive for ice" and that Mother had been located in West Virginia with Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  April 17, 2000           In West Virginia, Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III were removed from Mother and Boyfriend/Husband by Child Protective Services and placed in foster care.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  May 5, 2000              The DHS filed a Safe Family Home Report noting that Jane Doe I was in a Residential Substance Abuse Facility and stating, in relevant part, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      Mother has demonstrated her inability to change and provide her children with a safe family home by her actions. She has shown little regard for the Family Court order preventing her from taking the children out of the State of Hawaii. She appears to have shown little regard for [Jane Doe I], leaving the State without any idea of where [Jane Doe I] was or if she was safe. [Jane Doe I] had no idea her family left or how to contact [Mother] and sisters. It appears that Mother can easily detach and leave her children when the going gets tough. She has done it with her four eldest children and will probably do it to [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] if she were to continue as their caretaker.</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      If the family were never found in West Virginia and something were to happen to Mother, the children would be left with [Husband], which is not a very desirable alternative for them given what DHS knows about him. This potential appears to have been fine with Mother as she had no intention of contacting DHS, her attorney or any other party regarding her children. Mother has little insight or forethought, which could leave her children in a dangerous situation. She has acted in a very egocentric manner giving little thought to her children and their needs.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  May 5, 2000              The DHS filed a Permanent Plan stating that "[t]he goal for [Jane Doe I, Jane Doe II, and Jane Doe III] is adoption or guardianship to an appropriate family member."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  May 25, 2000             After a hearing on May 11, 2000, Judge George S. Yuda entered an order finding, in relevant part, that "[t]he child/ren's family is not presently willing and able to provide the child/ren with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan[.]"</block_quote>

<block_quote>  May 16, 2000             Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III were returned to Hawai`i.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  June 2000                During the first week of June 2000, Mother returned to Hilo for a short stay.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  June 26, 2000            The DHS filed a Supplemental Safe Family Home Report stating, in relevant part, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      At this point, [Mother] does not believe that she has done anything wrong by leaving the State of Hawaii with her children. She has this opinion, despite clear warnings by the Court, her attorney and DHS, informing her not to leave the state. Issues such as these have been the ongoing concern of the DHS. [Mother] is self-centered and has difficulty putting her children's needs before her own. [Mother] does love [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] and in her own way she probably loves [Jane Doe I] as well. However, her feelings toward [Jane Doe I] are unhealthy for [Jane Doe I]. [Mother] continues to blame [Jane Doe I] and has little insight to what has caused her children's problems. She does not seem to see that she has the majority of the responsibility for her children's difficulties, not only [Jane Doe I] but her adult children as well. DHS does not want to see [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] suffer the same fate as their older siblings.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  July 12, 2000            Mother contacted DHS and requested the preparation of a service plan for Mother in West Virginia.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  July 14, 2000            Judge Gaddis entered an order withdrawing the bench warrant for Mother and ordering that "Mother shall not remove the children from the island of Hawaii without prior court approval, and doing so would be a felony in the State of Hawaii." The order scheduled a "Combined OSC/Permanent Plan" hearing to occur on October 23, 2000.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  October 23, 2000         Judge Gaddis commenced a combined Order to Show Cause (OSC)/Permanent Plan hearing. Mother objected because she was living in West Virginia and no determination had been made whether the West Virginia home was a safe family home. Mother requested "that the [DHS] initiate the ICPC compact [Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Hawai`i Revised Statutes, Chapter 350E (1993)] right now and get moving in a service plan." Mother then revealed her West Virginia address. Judge Gaddis responded:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      Well, it's apparent to me that I'm going to have to, uh, re-schedule this matter. And we're gonna have to find another date. And it would appear to me to be prudent on the [DHS] to initiate an ICPC request. Uh, we know they take a long time. Uh, should the Department not prevail at the OSC/Permanency Hearing, then at least hopefully the [DHS] will have [a] worker in place and will, uh, have a situation where they can initiate some services.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  November 13, 2000        Judge Gaddis entered an Order Denying Mother's Oral Motion to Dismiss Combined Order to Show Cause/Permanent Plan Hearing.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  January 20, 2000         As a result of a conference on December 18, 2000, Judge Gaddis postponed the OSC/Permanent Plan hearing.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  February 12, 2001        As a result of a conference on January 29, 2001, Judge Gaddis postponed the OSC/Permanent Plan hearing.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  April 24, 2001           DHS reported to the court that "[a]n ICPC was generated on November 24, 2000."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  May 3, 2001              The home study done pursuant to the ICPC by Kelli Holbrook Nichols (Nichols) was completed. It did not approve of the home of Mother and Husband "as a placement resource for the children." It reported, in relevant part, as follows:</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      [Mother and Husband] have moved into a very small apartment that will not be adequate for her children, if returned to her custody. Their sole income is that of [Mother's] SSI check.<footnote_reference>[fn3]</footnote_reference>
[Husband] has been unemployed for the past four months and has no additional income. He recently turned down employment.</block_quote>

<block_quote>                      There appears to be little preparation made for the possibility of [Mother] regaining custody of her children. [Mother] seems to believe that circumstances will improve once the children are back with her, with no provision for how that will happen.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                      [Husband] was born and reared in West Virginia. . . .</block_quote>

. . . .

<bold>Concerns Regarding Placement:</bold>

. . . .

<block_quote>                        • [Mother] has a history of physically and emotionally abusing her older children, including [Jane Doe I]. When they reported sexual abuse by her various spouses and husbands, she turned on them and felt she could not [sic] longer trust them because they did not confide in her. She also accused her older children of "looking at" and seducing her boyfriends.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                        • [Husband] is an unemployed laborer. . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>                        • [Husband] has refused to take part in the parenting training offered by AYC. When the social worker came for visits, he would leave the room. He also refused to participate in similar parenting classes in Hawaii.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>                        • [Husband] has been designated at [sic] the disciplinarian for the children. He has a history of using corporal punishment on [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III]. He states that he was punished with a belt and paddle as a child. [Mother] has been a resident at the Women's Resource Center in the past, and reported to their social worker that</block_quote>

<block_quote>                        • [Husband] was controlling and physically abusive to her. She later denied this and stated that he would not talk to her when she would want to work out their problems.</block_quote>

(Footnote added.)

September 7, 2001         Trial.

September 10, 2001        Trial.

<block_quote>  October 17, 2001          Judge Gaddis entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FsOF and CsOL). Although not noted in its title, this document also contains fifteen (15) orders.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  November 14, 2001         Judge Gaddis entered the Order Awarding Permanent Custody and Establishing a Permanent Plan terminating Mother's parental and custodial duties and rights regarding Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III, and appointing the Director of the DHS as permanent custodian of Jane Doe I, Jane Doe II, and Jane Doe III. The goal of the Permanent Plan "is adoption or guardianship to an appropriate family member."</block_quote>

<block_quote>  November 26, 2001         Mother filed a motion for reconsideration.</block_quote>

January 16, 2002          Mother filed a notice of appeal.

<block_quote>  January 17, 2002          Judge Gaddis filed the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration.</block_quote>

<center>                 RELEVANT UNCHALLENGED FINDINGS OF FACT</center>
Mother does not challenge the following FsOF:

<block_quote>  15. In 1998, [Jane Doe I] refused to return to the home of [Mother] because she was afraid. [Mother] had been hitting [Jane Doe I] repeatedly on her back and arms. [Mother] also called [Jane Doe I] names such as "weakling", "bitch", and "whore." [Jane Doe I] was fearful of [Mother].</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  19. In June, 1998, [Mother] advised the DHS social worker that she was planning to move to Virginia with [Husband]. She said that the statements made to the [GAL] about moving without permission were made out of frustration. She told the social worker that if she planned to move she would make everyone aware of her plans.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  27. At court hearing on August 9, 1999, [Mother] advised the Court that she had decided not to attempt to reunify with [Jane Doe I]. She indicated that she did not want to do any more services and wanted to move to West Virginia. This Court expressed great concern about the recent corporeal punishment of [Jane Doe II] by [Mother]. The Court was very concerned about [Mother] spanking [Jane Doe III] because past attempts by [Mother] to physically discipline her older children rapidly escalated into severe physical abuse. . . .</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  33. At the time that [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] were removed from her care [Mother] elected not to return to Hawaii. She has remained in West Virginia with [Husband] although she did make one brief trip to Hawaii in June, 2000.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  37. [Mother] has been infected with the HIV virus for many years. At present her condition is stable. [Mother] and [Husband] take appropriate precautions to prevent the spread of the virus and [Mother] takes her medications as prescribed. . . .</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  42. [Mother] has repeatedly failed to care for and parent her older children. While she can provide appropriate care for very young children as children grow older and more assertive and demanding, [Mother] reacts by treating her children as peers. [Mother] is very suspicious of the relationship of her older girls with the men in her life and this has lead to repeated confrontations and arguments in the home. If her children rebel and challenge her authority, [Mother] reacts by either becoming verbally and physically abusive or by refusing to have any contact with her children. She frequently acts to satisfy her own needs at the expense of the needs of her children.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  45. While [Husband] does have family in West Virginia, his family has refused to become involved in this case and appear to offer little support to the couple at this time. . . .</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  47. [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] are happy and well adjusted in their present placement. . . .</block_quote>

<block_quote>  48. [Mother] has not been able to raise three other older girls successfully and has ultimately physically abused each of them. [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] are subject to threat of harm of physical abuse by [Mother] for the same reasons. [Mother] has been emotionally abusive to her older children and it appears likely that she will emotionally abuse her younger girls in a similar fashion as they grow older.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  51. The proposed permanent plans for the children are in the best interests of the children.</block_quote>

<center>                      APPELLATE STANDARD OF REVIEW</center>
A trial court's findings of fact are reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard of review. <italic>Dan v. State</italic>, <cross_reference>76 Haw. 423</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>428</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>879 P.2d 528</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>533</cross_reference> (1994). This is true of its implicit and explicit findings.

<block_quote>  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</block_quote>

<italic>State v. Okumura</italic>, <cross_reference>78 Haw. 383</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>392</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>894 P.2d 80</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>89</cross_reference> (1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

<center>                               DISCUSSION</center><center>                                   I.</center>
Mother challenges FsOF nos. 18, 36, 39, 40, 43, 44, and 49. We will discuss them in order. FOF no. 18 states as follows:

<block_quote>  [Mother's] new relationship was a source of concern for the Court. [Husband] had serious conflicts and relationship problems with his first wife and his daughter from that relationship had severe emotional problems. [Husband] had failed to provide any emotional support for his teenage daughter at [the] time when she badly needed it.</block_quote>

Mother contends that this finding is improperly based on the court's knowledge obtained when it presided over Husband's divorce case. It appears that Mother did not seek the removal of the judge who heard this case. In this appeal, Mother is not arguing that the judge who heard this case should not have done so. The question presented is whether the record in this case supports this finding. The answer is yes.

<center>                                   II.</center>
FOF no. 36 states as follows:

<block_quote>  After [Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III] were removed from [Mother] in West Virginia, DHS requested a home study of the home of [Mother] and [Husband] by the West Virginia Department of Human Resources. On May 3, 2001, [Nichols], Regional Home finding Supervisor, for the West Virginia Department of Human Resource refused to approve the home of [Mother and Husband] as a placement resource for [Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III] due to numerous concerns about the parenting capabilities of both [Mother and Husband].</block_quote>

Mother contends that the finding that Nichols "refused to approve the home of [Mother and Husband] as a placement resource for [Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III] due to numerous concerns about the parenting capabilities of both [Mother and Husband]" is clearly erroneous. Mother makes this contention notwithstanding that the report filed by Nichols states that "[t]he decision of the Regional Home Finding unit was NOT to approve this home as a placement resource for the children." What Mother really is challenging is the validity of the decision made by Nichols. Mother's mistake is her failure to recognize that she is appealing the decision of the family court, not the decision of Nichols.

FOF no. 39 states as follows: "Recently [Mother] has completed a parenting program with Action Youth Care, Inc. twice. She continues to receive supportive services and parenting training from that agency due to anger issues and depression."

Mother contends that this finding is clearly erroneous because it implies that Mother was not "receiving in West Virginia the same services she was ordered to receive by the Hawaii service plan." We disagree with Mother's interpretation.

<center>                                   IV.</center>
Mother challenges FsOF nos. 40, 43, and 44. They state as follows:

<block_quote>  40. [Mother] has suffered from long term psychological problems for many years. Her intellectual functioning is low average to borderline and she is immature and emotionally reactive. She suffers from long term chronic depression which can be severe at times and can cause her to be suicidal. Despite years of supportive services she continues to show little understanding of the emotional needs of her children. [Mother] has a very bad temper and small difficulties or incidents can cause her to react in a very violent manner. As a result normal discipline by [Mother] such as spanking has quickly escalated into severe physical abuse in the past and may do so again.</block_quote>

. . . .

<block_quote>  43. [Mother] has repeatedly been untruthful with social workers and service providers in the past. [Husband] has been very resistant to services and strongly resents state intervention in his family situation. It is highly unlikely that either [Husband] or [Mother] would voluntarily report or seek help for problems in the home if the children were placed with them in the future. [Mother] continues to view the matter of child discipline as a family matter that is between herself and her children.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  44. At present no one in the family home has the ability or motivation to protect the children from harm or to insure that court orders are enforced.</block_quote>

Mother challenges these findings based on evidence in the record to the contrary. It appears that Mother does not understand the applicable standard of review. These FsOF are not clearly erroneous.

Mother contends that the court erred when it denied what was, in effect, her motion to cancel the OSC/Permanent Plan hearing. She states that

<block_quote>  [t]he record is clear that after Mother left Hawaii, DHS made no effort to devise a service plan for Mother and her new home, despite Mother's requests.</block_quote>

<block_quote>  Mother's argument in support of her motion to dismiss was simple. Without a service plan for her home, she has not been provided the opportunity to demonstrate whether she can keep her home safe with the assistance of a service plan.</block_quote>

We disagree. This case commenced in February 1997. In September 2002, a new service plan was not a prerequisite to the family court's adjudication of Mother's and Husband's ability to provide Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III "with a safe family home[.]"

<center>                                   VI.</center>
Mother challenges FOF no. 49. It states as follows:

<block_quote>  The parents are not currently willing or able to provide these children with a safe family home even with the assistance of a service plan and it is not reasonably foreseeable that the parents will become willing or able to provide the children with a safe family home even with the assistance of a service plan within a reasonable period of time.</block_quote>

<center>                                   A.</center>
Mother contends as follows:

<block_quote>  Finding 49 is clearly erroneous, at least with respect to Mother. This finding refers to the "parents" without indicating whether it is referring to Mother and [Husband], to Mother and father of Jane Doe [I], or to Mother and father of Jane Doe[s II] and [III].</block_quote>

It appears that Mother does not understand that the "family home" includes both Mother and Husband and that FOF No. 49 cannot be clearly erroneous unless it is clearly erroneous with respect to both Mother and Husband.

We agree that FOF no. 49 could have been more specific. However, the fact that, on November 16, 1998, the family court entered an order that Husband "agrees to participate in this proceeding as a party" combined with the fact that, in its FsOF and CsOL, the family court's order no. 12 states that "[t]he parents are dismissed as parties in the above entitled matter" makes it obvious that the family court's use of the word "parents" in FOF no. 49 referred to all "parents" who were parties in the case.

<center>                                   B.</center>
The essence of Mother's appeal is her contention that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence supporting FOF no. 49.

Mother notes that on September 17, 1999, the family court decided that "[t]he child/ren's family is presently willing and able to provide [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] with a safe family home, with the assistance of a service plan" and then on February 14, 2000, the family court decided that "[t]he child/ren's family is not presently willing and able to provide [Jane Doe II] and [Jane Doe III] with a safe family home, with the assistance of a service plan[.]" Mother contends that the only difference between the two dates was the location of the "family home" and argues that the difference is insufficient for the change in the court's decision.

For comparison, the relevant dates are September 17, 1999, and October 17, 2001. We conclude that Mother ignores the following three relevant differences. First, Mother ignores the fact that the September 17, 1999 decision pertained only to that particular time and was temporary, whereas the February 14, 2000 decision pertained to both that particular time and the future and was permanent.

Second, Mother ignores her total abandonment of Jane Doe I at a crucial time in Jane Doe I's life. This act is clear evidence of Mother's selfish priorities.

Third, Mother ignores her intentional violation of the family court's order not to move Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III out of the court's jurisdiction without the court's prior permission. This act demonstrates the unreliability of Mother's promises, commitments, alleged reforms and changes, her willingness to violate the law whenever she decides to do so, and her willingness to subordinate the interests of Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III to her own interests. If the move of the family to West Virginia was such a good idea, Mother should have convinced the court of that fact before she moved. Predictably, the route she chose unreasonably caused serious disturbances in the lives of Jane Doe II and Jane Doe III.

<center>                               CONCLUSION</center>
Accordingly, we affirm the family court's November 14, 2001 Order Awarding Permanent Custody and Establishing a Permanent Plan.

<block_quote>    <bold>§ <cross_reference>587-26</cross_reference> Service plan.</bold> (a) A service plan is a specific written plan prepared by an authorized agency and child's family and presented to such members of the child's family as the appropriate authorized agency deems to be necessary to the success of the plan, including, but not limited to, the member or members of the child's family who have legal custody, guardianship, or permanent custody of the child at the time that the service plan is being formulated or revised under this chapter.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (i) After a hearing that the court deems to be appropriate, the court may order terms, conditions, and consequences to constitute a service plan as the court deems to be in the best interests of the child; provided that a copy of the service plan shall be incorporated as part of the order. The court need not order a service plan if the court finds that aggravated circumstances are present.</block_quote>

For either the examination or treatment, the court may place the child in a hospital or other suitable facility.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (m) The court shall order reasonable supervised or unsupervised visitation rights to the child's family and to any person interested in the welfare of the child and that the visitation shall be in the discretion of an authorized agency and the child's guardian ad litem, unless it is shown that rights of visitation may be detrimental to the best interests of the child; provided that the court need not order any visitation if the court finds that aggravated circumstances are present.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (n) Each of the natural parents shall be ordered to complete the medical information forms and consent to release medical information required under section <cross_reference>578-14.5</cross_reference> and shall return the completed forms to the department.</block_quote>

<block_quote>    (b) Notice of review hearings shall be served upon the parties and upon the present foster parent or parents, each of whom shall be entitled to participate in the proceedings as a party. Notice of the review hearing shall be served by the department upon the present foster parent or parents no less than forty-eight hours before the scheduled hearing. No hearing shall be held until the foster parent or parents are served.
