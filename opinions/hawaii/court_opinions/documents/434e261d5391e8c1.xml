Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandate filed by Petitioners William R. Hayes, Jr. and Irene Y. Hayes and the papers in support, it appears that: (1) Petitioners ask this court to review a ruling issued by the respondent judge in <italic>Hayes v. Pereira</italic><italic>Enterprises, Inc</italic>., Civil No. 98-0308, presently pending in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit; and (2) Petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to a writ of mandamus. <italic>See</italic> <italic>Straub Clinic  Hospital v.</italic><italic>Kochi</italic>, <cross_reference>81 Hawai`i 102</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>952 P.2d 390</cross_reference> (1996). Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of mandate is denied without prejudice to any remedy Petitioners may have by way of appeal.
