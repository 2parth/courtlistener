<opinion_text><center>                          <italic>ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL</italic></center></opinion_text>
<opinion_text>  Upon review of the record, it appears that the circuit court's June 15, 2001 order dismissing Civil No. 01-1-0929, the Honorable Victoria S. Marks, presiding, has not been reduced to a separate judgment, as required by HRCP 58. <italic>SeeJenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming  Wright</italic>,<cross_reference>76 Haw. 115</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>869 P.2d 1334</cross_reference> (1994). Thus, this appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
