Upon consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus filed by Petitioners-Appellants Jayson Ames Virtudes, Milton Wendell Moreno, and Eugene James Hutch, and the papers in support, it appears that Petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to mandamus relief. Therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.
