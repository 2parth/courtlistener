<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  William E. Page contends that the Workers' Compensation Commission erred in suspending his compensation benefits on the basis that he unjustifiably refused selective employment procured for him by Pine Tree Press, Inc. ("employer"). Upon reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the commission's decision. Rule 5A:27.

On appellate review, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <italic>R.G. Moore Bldg.</italic><italic>Corp. v. Mullins,</italic> <cross_reference>10 Va. App. 211</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>212</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>390 S.E.2d 788</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>788</cross_reference>
(1990). "To support a finding of refusal of selective employment 'the record must disclose (1) a bona fide job offer suitable to the employee's capacity; (2) [a job offer that was] procured for the employee by the employer; and (3) an unjustified refusal by the employee to accept the job.' " <italic>James</italic><italic>v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>8 Va. App. 512</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>515</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>382 S.E.2d 487</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>489</cross_reference> (1989) (quoting <italic>Ellerson v. W.O. Grubb Steel Erection</italic><italic>Co.,</italic> <cross_reference>1 Va. App. 97</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>98</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>335 S.E.2d 379</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>380</cross_reference> (1985)).

There was no dispute before the commission that CarQuest Auto Parts ("CarQuest") made a bona fide job offer to claimant to work as a delivery driver, and that this offer was procured for claimant by employer.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference>

In granting employer's application to suspend claimant's benefits, the commission found that claimant unjustifiably refused to accept the job offer. Claimant testified that he refused the job because it would interfere with the operation of his family-owned janitorial business. Through this business, claimant provided cleaning services to the United Methodist Home, five days per week, from approximately 4:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. The commission found that claimant's presence at the janitorial service job was not necessary for the operation of the business. Therefore, the commission found that claimant's reason for refusing the job procured for him by employer was not justified. If this finding is supported by credible evidence, we must uphold it on appeal. <italic>James,</italic><cross_reference>8 Va. App. at 515</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>382 S.E.2d at 488</cross_reference>.

Claimant and his wife testified that claimant's involvement in the janitorial service was supervisory in nature. Claimant admitted that his wife, daughter, or a male employee, who had worked in the business for years, were capable of supervising the work. Claimant stated that he had to be present on the job to lock up, and because it had "just [become] a habit." Based upon the testimony of claimant and his wife, we cannot say that the commission erred in finding that claimant did not provide a valid excuse for refusing the job procured for him by employer. Their testimony provides credible evidence to support the commission's finding.

Accordingly, we affirm the commission's decision.

<italic>Affirmed.</italic>

<footnote_body><footnote_number>[fn1]</footnote_number> Moreover, claimant did not argue before the commission that he was not medically able to perform the job. Accordingly, we will not consider this issue on appeal. <italic>See Green v. Warwick</italic><italic>Plumbing  Heating Corp.,</italic> <cross_reference>5 Va.
