<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  General Motors Corporation (employer) appeals a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission finding employer failed to prove that Ronald Wayne Adams was capable of returning to his pre-injury employment. We have reviewed the record and the commission's opinion and find that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the commission in its final opinion. <underline>See Adams v.</underline><underline>General Motors Corp.</underline>, VWC File No. 198-45-14 (Dec. 11, 2007). We dispense with oral argument and summarily affirm because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process. <underline>See</underline> Code ยง<cross_reference>17.1-403</cross_reference>; Rule 5A:27.

<block_quote>  <underline>Affirmed.</underline></block_quote><page_number>Page 1</page_number>
