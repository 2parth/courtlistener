<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Howmet Corporation and its insurer appeal a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission awarding benefits to Ronald L. Smith for hearing loss as a compensable ordinary disease of life. We have reviewed the record and the commission's opinion and hold that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the award for the reasons stated by the commission in its final opinion. <underline>See Smith v. Howmet Corp.</underline>, VWC File No. 224-25-75 (April 24, 2007). We dispense with oral argument and summarily affirm because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process. <underline>See</underline> Code ยง <cross_reference>17.1-403</cross_reference>; Rule 5A:27.
