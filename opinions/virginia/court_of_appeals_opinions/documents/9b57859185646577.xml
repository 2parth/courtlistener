</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  American Reliance Insurance Company, the insurer of Joe's Home Improvement Company ("Joe's"), appeals from a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission awarding benefits to Jeffrey Wayne Allen. The sole issue on appeal is whether the commission erred in assessing attorney's fees against the insurer, pursuant to Code Sec. <cross_reference>65.2-713</cross_reference>, for its unreasonable defense and delayed payment of Allen's claim. Finding no error, we affirm the commission's decision.

Code Sec. <cross_reference>65.2-713</cross_reference> authorizes the commission to assess an employer or insurer who has defended any proceeding without reasonable grounds the whole costs of the proceedings, including a reasonable attorney's fee. "Assessment of . . . attorney's fees is not required in every defense of a proceeding without reasonable grounds. Assessment is left to the sound discretion of the Commission [and will not be disturbed on appeal] unless there is an abuse of discretion."<italic>Jensen Press v. Ale,</italic> <cross_reference>1 Va. App. 153</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>159</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>336 S.E.2d 522</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>525-26</cross_reference> (1985). <italic>See also Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ. v.</italic><italic>Frye,</italic> <cross_reference>6 Va. App. 589</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>596-97</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>371 S.E.2d 34</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>38</cross_reference> (1988).

The commission found that the insurer defended against Allen's claim without reasonable grounds and assessed a $4,000 attorney's fee. A review of the evidence establishes that the commission's finding is supported by credible evidence and involves no abuse of discretion.

Allen testified that he told a representative of the insurer, who visited him in the hospital after his August 4, 1992 accident, that he was hired on August 3, 1992 by Joe Horrell, the owner of Joe's. Allen never stated that he was employed by or loaned to Pat McDowell. Allen did not know Pat McDowell at the time he spoke to the representative.

In his November 4, 1992 recorded statement, Horrell stated that Allen was working for him at the time of the accident. He also stated that Allen had been loaned to McDowell, who needed some help on a roofing job. Although this recorded statement may have been ambiguous regarding the identity of Allen's employer, that ambiguity was resolved by Horrell's December 11, 1992 notarized statement. In that statement, Horrell stated that Allen was working for him on the day of the accident, and that Joe's had a subcontract with McDowell to provide labor for the job. In addition, Horrell's January 19, 1993 letter to Tom Everette conclusively established that Allen was an employee of Joe's at the time of the accident and that Joe's was acting as a subcontractor providing labor for McDowell on the day of the accident.

Credible evidence supports the commission's finding that the employment relationship between Allen and Joe's was plainly and unquestionably established without the necessity of commission proceedings. As the commission noted, while there may have been some initial confusion as to whether Allen was a Joe's employee, that confusion did not exist after January 19, 1993. After the letter was sent on that day, the insurer had no reasonable grounds to defend against Allen's claim on the basis that he was not a Joe's employee. Yet, the insurer continued to do so, delaying payment to Allen and forcing all parties to go through the expense of a lengthy hearing on January 28, 1994. Therefore, we cannot say that the commission abused its discretion in assessing attorney's fees against the insurer.

Accordingly, we affirm the commission's decision.

<italic>Affirmed.</italic>
