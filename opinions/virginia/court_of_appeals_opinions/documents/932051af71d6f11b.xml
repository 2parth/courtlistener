<opinion_text><unpublished>  Charles J. Shores (father) and Elaine Shores (mother) were divorced by decree of the trial court entered on September 17, 1992, which reserved and deferred the issue of child custody for adjudication by the appropriate Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. During subsequent proceedings, mother was awarded custody of the children, and father now appeals to this Court.

The parties are fully conversant with the record, and a recitation of the facts is unnecessary to the disposition of the issue on appeal. Under familiar principles, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, mother in this instance. <italic>Pommerenke v. Pommerenke,</italic> <cross_reference>7 Va. App. 241</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>244</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>372 S.E.2d 630</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>631</cross_reference> (1988).

In a child custody dispute, the "lodestar for the court is the best interest of the child." <italic>Smith v. Pond,</italic> <cross_reference>5 Va. App. 161</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>163</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>360 S.E.2d 885</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>886</cross_reference> (1987); <italic>see Ferris v. Underwood,</italic> <cross_reference>3 Va. App. 25</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>28</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>348 S.E.2d 18</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>19</cross_reference> (1986). In resolving this issue, the trial court was required to consider all evidence relevant to those factors set forth in Code Sec. <cross_reference>20-107.2</cross_reference>.<footnote_reference>[fn1]</footnote_reference> <italic>See Venable</italic><italic>v. Venable,</italic> <cross_reference>2 Va. App. 178</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>187</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>342 S.E.2d 646</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>651</cross_reference> (1986).

A trial court is presumed to have thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child's best interests. Although a trial court may fail to specify and recite in its order all the possible reasons and adequate bases for its determination, where it is obvious from review of the record that the trial court's determination was made with the child's welfare as paramount, and it is clear that the decision is in the child's best interests, the determination is not without substantial, competent, and credible evidence to support it.

<italic>Farley v. Farley,</italic> <cross_reference>9 Va. App. 326</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>329</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>387 S.E.2d 794</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>796</cross_reference>
(1990) (citations omitted).

Here, in a letter opinion, the trial court recognized that the evidence established the difficult economic circumstances of the mother and attendant adversity both to herself and the children. In this context, the trial judge noted that "it would seem more appropriate to provide [mother] with the financial and other support necessary for her to have a fair opportunity to demonstrate her fitness, or lack of it, to provide for these children." Father contends that these and related comments by the trial judge indicated that the decision was based solely upon a finding that father was not providing mother with child support in an amount ordained by Code Sec. <cross_reference>20-108.2</cross_reference>, without considering evidence of other circumstances necessary to a proper determination of custody. <italic>See</italic> Code Sec. <cross_reference>20-107.2</cross_reference>; <italic>Hughes</italic><italic>v. Gentry,</italic> ___ Va. App. ___ ___, <cross_reference>443 S.E.2d 448</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>451-52</cross_reference>
(1994). We disagree.

When viewed with the entire record, we find that the observations of the court simply acknowledged the unequal economic status of the parties, without identifying such disparity or other economic factors as dispositive considerations. This Court will not "fix upon isolated statements of the trial judge taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied." <italic>Yarborough v. Commonwealth,</italic><cross_reference>217 Va. 971</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>978</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>234 S.E.2d 286</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>291</cross_reference> (1977). Sufficient credible evidence relevant to a proper consideration and disposition of the custody issue was before the trial court, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal.

<italic>Affirmed.</italic>
