<opinion_byline><unpublished>  JUDGE JOHANNA L. FITZPATRICK

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Murray L. Steinberg (father) seeks reversal of the trial court's decision ordering joint legal custody of the parties' four year old child with primary physical custody awarded to Katherine T. Steinberg (mother). In addition, father appeals that portion of the trial court's order directing him to pay child support. He presents numerous grounds of error as the basis for this appeal. For the following reasons we affirm the judgment of the trial court.

<center>                               <bold>BACKGROUND</bold></center>
As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite only those facts necessary to explain our decision. The parties were married in 1986, a second marriage for each. There was one child<page_number>Page 2</page_number>
of this marriage, Chelsea Renee, born June 2, 1988. The parties separated in September 1990, and entered into a written separation agreement effective December 7, 1990. Paragraph 2 of their agreement provides in pertinent part:

<block_quote>  [B]oth parties agree that they shall have joint custody of the infant child of the parties, that the child shall spend equal time with each parent, and being that the child will be with the parties an equal amount of time, neither party shall pay to the other child support and both parties shall pay equally any costs for child care. Both parties agree that the foregoing is in the best interests of the child and the terms of which shall be set forth in a final divorce decree.</block_quote>

Chelsea spent equal time with each parent until the court's determination of primary physical custody to the mother in May 1991. Thereafter, Chelsea was with her father approximately 47% of the time.

Father has two children from a previous marriage and an associated total support obligation for those children of $550 per month. In addition, father has an interest expense of $133 per month on a $16,000 loan incurred for the production of income. Father presented the trial court with a detailed summary of the factors relevant for rebuttal of the presumptive statutory guideline amount set forth in Code §§ <cross_reference>20-108.1</cross_reference> and<cross_reference>20-108.2</cross_reference>.

The trial judge found that the mother's income was $2500 per month. There was no direct evidence establishing the father's current income. However, in addition to the testimony of the parties, the trial judge considered the parties' 1990 amended tax return and other circumstantial evidence, and determined the father's "income for the purposes of implementing the child<page_number>Page 3</page_number>
support guidelines at $31,000 a year currently," or $2,584 per month. The father alleges that his actual income in 1990 was $25,943, or $2,161.92 per month. He estimated that his income for 1991 was $22,636, or $1,868 per month.

At the custody hearing, the evidence showed that both parents were fit custodians, and that their child was bright, beautiful and doing exceptionally well under the situation as it had existed for the past year. After a lengthy <underline>ore</underline> <underline>tenus</underline> hearing, the trial court awarded the parties joint legal custody with primary physical custody to the mother. Father has visitation approximately 47% of the time resulting in an eleven day decrease per year in the amount of time the child is with the father from the parties' prior shared custody agreement.

<center>                              <bold>CHILD SUPPORT</bold></center>
Father argues that the trial court failed to properly calculate his child support obligation. Specifically, he argues that the trial judge used an incorrect income amount to calculate his support obligation utilizing the statutory guidelines and that the trial judge failed to deviate (downward) sufficiently from the presumed guideline amount. Code § <cross_reference>20-108.2</cross_reference>.

In Virginia, "`a contract between a husband and wife cannot prevent the court from exercising' its power to modify child support awards." <underline>Alexander v. Alexander</underline>, <cross_reference>12 Va. App. 691</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>695</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>406 S.E.2d 666</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>668</cross_reference> (1991) (quoting <underline>Featherstone v. Brooks</underline>,<cross_reference>220 Va. 443</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>446</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>258 S.E.2d 513</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>515</cross_reference> (1979)). "The starting point . . . for determining the child support obligation of a party . . .<page_number>Page 4</page_number>
is to compute the presumptive amount using the schedule found in Code § <cross_reference>20-108.2</cross_reference>(B)." <underline>Watkinson v. Henley</underline>, <cross_reference>13 Va. App. 151</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>158</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>409 S.E.2d 470</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>473</cross_reference> (1991). Prior to making this calculation, however, the trial judge must first make a determination of each party's gross monthly income.

Father argues that the trial judge erred in not utilizing his evidence of projected income which was based on 1990 tax returns, and that the trial judge imputed income to him before the initial calculation under the guidelines was made. We disagree. There was conflicting evidence regarding the father's actual income for 1991. The trial judge, after hearing all the evidence, made a factual finding that the father's gross monthly income exceeded the amount that he claimed. This finding was based on the judge's review of recent tax returns, the father's ability as the sole stockholder in a business to set his own salary and benefits, and other circumstantial evidence.

The evidence shows that the trial judge did not impute income improperly at the initial determination of the parties' gross income, rather, he found as a fact that the father's income was greater than the amount stated. "A trial court's finding of fact on conflicting evidence heard ore tenus has the weight of a jury verdict, and will be permitted to stand unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it." <underline>Durrette v. Durrette</underline>, <cross_reference>223 Va. 328</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>332</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>288 S.E.2d 432</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>434</cross_reference> (1982).

The trial judge found the mother's income to be $2,500 per month and the father's income to be $2,584 per month, creating a<page_number>Page 5</page_number>
combined monthly gross income of $5,084. The trial judge, applying the statutory guidelines, then determined correctly the presumptive amount of support to be $675 per month. Added to this amount was the cost of insurance attributable to the child and the costs incurred for child care, creating a total support obligation of $1,089 per month. The father's share of the total support obligation was determined to be $550 per month. We find no error in this determination.

In addition, father argues that the trial court failed to deviate sufficiently from the guideline amount. "Once the presumptive amount is determined, the trial court may deviate from the presumptive amount if such deviation is justified by factors recognized in Code §§ <cross_reference>20-108.1</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>20-107.2</cross_reference>."<underline>Alexander</underline>, <cross_reference>12 Va. App. at 695</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>406 S.E.2d at 668</cross_reference>. The father presented evidence of: his other child support obligations of $550 per month; the large percentage of time that his daughter spends in his care; monthly interest payments on a debt incurred for the production of income; travel expenses associated with visitation; and tax consequences and benefits to each of the parties. The record shows that the trial judge made the downward deviation from the presumptive amount requested by the father to $475, but declined to give the father a dollar for dollar credit based on the evidence presented. It is clearly within the discretion of the trial judge to determine the amount of credit due once all the factors of Code §§ <cross_reference>20-107.2</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>20-108.1</cross_reference> have been considered. From the record before us, we find no abuse of<page_number>Page 6</page_number>
discretion by the trial court.

The father's additional assignments of error on the issue of child support, which include, <underline>inter</underline> <underline>alia</underline>, that the trial judge: (1) erred in requiring both parents to share any of the child's medical expenses not covered by insurance; (2) failed to consider the parties' separation agreement as evidence of the proper amount of child support; and (3) failed to specify the basis for the deviation; are without merit.

<center>                              <bold>CHILD CUSTODY</bold></center>
Father asserts that the trial judge committed error when he awarded primary physical custody to the mother, thereby denying the father's right to be with his daughter at least an amount of time equal to that of the mother; and that such an award was based on an improper preference in favor of the mother. We disagree.

"In matters of a child's welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child's best interests. . . .A trial court's determination of matters within its discretion is reversible on appeal only for an abuse of that discretion." <underline>Farley v.</underline><underline>Farley</underline>, <cross_reference>9 Va. App. 326</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>328</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>387 S.E.2d 794</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>795</cross_reference> (1990) (citations omitted). We find that the trial judge properly considered all the relevant evidence presented to him and that the custody determination was made after consideration of all the statutory factors and the child's best interests.

At the hearing on the motion to reconsider the trial court's<page_number>Page 7</page_number>
prior custody determination, the trial judge stated in great detail that he had considered all the evidence presented at the prior hearing from both parties. On the issue of the father's allegation of adultery by the mother, the trial judge concluded:

<block_quote>  The Court considered all the evidence that day, some evidence being the relationship of Mrs. Steinberg with Kenny Shoemaker. The Court considered that evidence with all the other evidence. There was no evidence to this Court that showed any relationship with Kenny Shoemaker or anyone else would in any way affect the child or make Mrs. Steinberg an unfit parent. That was certainly considered . . . .</block_quote>

In addition, the trial judge stated that he had fully considered the parties' prior joint custody arrangement and "concluded that that type of arrangement was not in the best interest of the child" and that "[i]t just didn't work." The trial judge, in noting that the parties were unable to work out a minor modification in the visitation schedule, further opined that "the situation that was contemplated by the parties pursuant to [their] agreement could never work in this case."

The trial judge noted that the living situation of the child at the time of the hearing, with the mother as the primary caretaker, produced a bright, beautiful, loving and caring child and that the continuation of that situation was in the child's best interest. He stated that his only concern was the best interest of the child, and he specifically found that both parents were fit and "good parents." The judge then reviewed the evidence regarding the child's present living situation and found that the child, during the last year, had done exceptionally well. He used this evidence of past performance as an indicator<page_number>Page 8</page_number>
to "try to predict what is going to happen in the future, all in the best interests of this child." The judge found that the child was prospering and that from all the evidence she would continue to do so. Accordingly, he awarded joint legal custody with primary physical custody to the mother.

We find no evidence in the record supporting the father's assertion that the trial judge improperly applied a presumption in favor of the mother. To the contrary, the trial judge specifically stated:

<block_quote>  The Court certainly considered there was no legal presumption or inference favoring the mother. The Court did not in any way invoke any type of presumption or inference. The Court did consider what was in the best interest of the child.</block_quote>

"The judgment of the trial court is presumed correct and he who asserts the contrary is required to overcome the presumption by record proof. . . ." <underline>Kaufman v. Kaufman</underline>, <cross_reference>7 Va. App. 488</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>499</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>375 S.E.2d 374</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>380</cross_reference> (1988); <underline>accord</underline> <underline>Reid v. Reid</underline>, <cross_reference>14 Va. App. 505</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>515</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>419 S.E.2d 398</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>404</cross_reference> (1992). "Absent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts," <underline>Yarborough v. Commonwealth</underline>, <cross_reference>217 Va. 971</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>978</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>234 S.E.2d 286</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>291</cross_reference> (1977), and that the trial court "thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child's best interests." <underline>Farley</underline>, <cross_reference>9 Va. App. at 329</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>387 S.E.2d at 796</cross_reference>;<underline>see</underline> <underline>also</underline> <underline>Mason v. Commonwealth</underline>, <cross_reference>219 Va. 1091</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>1098</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>254 S.E.2d 116</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>120</cross_reference>, <underline>cert. denied</underline>, <cross_reference>444 U.S. 919</cross_reference> (1979) (trial judge is presumed to have<page_number>Page 9</page_number>
properly based his decision on the evidence presented).

We held in <underline>Visikides v. Derr</underline>, <cross_reference>3 Va. App. 69</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>72</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>348 S.E.2d 40</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>42</cross_reference> (1986), that it was reversible error for a trial court to apply the so-called "tender years inference" favoring one parent over the other in considering the best interests of the child. Code § <cross_reference>31-15</cross_reference> states in pertinent part:

<block_quote>  [T]he court . . . in awarding the custody of the child to either parent or to some other person, shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the child, and as between the parents <underline>there shall be no presumption or</underline> <underline>inference of law in favor of either</underline>.</block_quote>

(emphasis added).

There is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial judge acted disingenuously by clearly stating the correct principle of law and applying another. Rather, the trial judge made the specific finding that while both parents were fit and "good parents," the father was overly concerned with winning and control which was not in the child's best interest. Further, the trial judge found that the child's present living situation with the mother was one in which the child had prospered and that it was likely that she would continue to do so. These findings are amply supported by credible evidence in the record. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

<block_quote>  <underline>Affirmed.</underline></block_quote><page_number>Page 1</page_number>
