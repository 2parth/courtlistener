<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Frank S. Taitano appeals from the circuit court's determination that his appeal of a juvenile and domestic relations district court decision was untimely. Upon reviewing the record and briefs of the parties, we conclude that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the circuit court's decision. Rule 5A:27.

Code Sec. <cross_reference>16.1-296</cross_reference>(A) reads in pertinent part: "From any final order or judgment of the juvenile court affecting the rights or interests of any person coming within its jurisdiction, an appeal may be taken within ten days from the entry of a final judgment, order or conviction."

Here, the juvenile and domestic relations district court order was entered on January 26, 1994. Taitano filed his notice of appeal on April 1, 1994. Clearly, then, the notice was untimely.

Taitano argues, however, that he did not receive a copy of the district court's order until March 25, 1994. As a result, he contends that the circuit court erred in finding that his appeal was untimely. We find no support in Virginia statutes or rules for this position. The General Assembly, in crafting Code Sec. <cross_reference>16.1-296</cross_reference>(A), determined that the appeal time should run from "entry" of the final order, not receipt of a copy of the order by the disgruntled party. Moreover, Taitano can point to no authority by which the district or circuit court can extend the notice deadline.

In view of the inflexible deadline contained in Code Sec.<cross_reference>16.1-296</cross_reference>(A), and the absence of any authority creating an exception to that inflexibility, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in determining that Taitano's appeal was untimely. Accordingly, we affirm that determination.

<italic>Affirmed.</italic>
