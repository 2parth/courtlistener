<opinion_byline><unpublished>  PER CURIAM.

</unpublished></opinion_byline>
<opinion_text><unpublished>  Kroger Company and its insurer (hereinafter referred to as "employer") appeal a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission finding that Diane L. Rouleau's decision to refuse employer's offer of selective employment was reasonable and not unjustified. We have reviewed the record and the commission's opinion and find that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the commission in its final opinion. <underline>See</underline> <underline>Rouleau v. Kroger Company,</underline> VWC File No. 202-53-23 (Mar. 7, 2006). We dispense with oral argument and summarily affirm because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process. <underline>See</underline> Code ยง<cross_reference>17.1-403</cross_reference>; Rule 5A:27.

<underline>Affirmed.</underline>
