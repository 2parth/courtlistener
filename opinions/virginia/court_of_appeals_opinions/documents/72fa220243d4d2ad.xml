On January 11, 1994, a panel of this Court affirmed appellant's convictions of second degree murder and the use of a firearm in the commission of murder, holding that his reprosecution was not barred on double jeopardy grounds.<italic>See Robinson v. Commonwealth,</italic> <cross_reference>17 Va. App. 551</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>439 S.E.2d 622</cross_reference>
(1994). Appellant's petition for rehearing <italic>en banc</italic> was granted on March 24, 1994, and the mandate of the January 11, 1994, opinion was stayed.

The appeal was reheard <italic>en banc</italic> on June 2, 1994. For the reasons stated in the original majority opinion, the Court affirms the decision of the trial court. Therefore, the say of the mandate of the January 11, 1994 opinion is lifted, and the case is affirmed in accordance with that opinion and its adoption by this order.

Judges Benton, Coleman, Koontz and Elder, for the reasons stated in Judge Benton's dissent from the original decision,<italic>Robinson v. Commonwealth,</italic> <cross_reference>17 Va. App. 551</cross_reference>, 557, <cross_reference>439 S.E.2d 622</cross_reference>,<page_number>Page 815</page_number>
