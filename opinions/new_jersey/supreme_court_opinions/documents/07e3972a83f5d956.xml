2. Appellant was correctly charged with the receiver's compensation and administration expenses. However, the counsel fee should be reduced to $350.

<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  We concur in the view of the learned Vice-Chancellor that the chattel mortgage is void as to creditors for failure to set out in the affidavit annexed thereto a true and full statement of the consideration thereof as required by <italic>R.S. 1937, 46:28-5.</italic> There was a lack of substantial compliance with this provision of the statute. Honesty is not alone the determinative; completeness of statement is also a prerequisite.

We are also of opinion that the Vice-Chancellor correctly charged appellant with the receiver's compensation and<page_number>Page 120</page_number>
administration expenses; but we think the counsel fee should be reduced to $350.

And there was jurisdiction in equity under the circumstances.<italic>Pryor</italic> v. <italic>Gray, <cross_reference>70 N.J. Eq. 413</cross_reference>; affirmed, <cross_reference>72 N.J. Eq. 436</cross_reference>.</italic>

The evidence does not sustain the contention that appellant "was a conditional vendor of the printing press." But assuming such an agreement at the outset, it was superseded by the chattel mortgage.

Inasmuch as the complainant, Photo-Lith, Inc., has not appealed, we have no occasion to determine the propriety of the dismissal of the bill as to it.

The decree is modified accordingly, and, as so modified, affirmed.
