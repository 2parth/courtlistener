<opinion_byline>  PER CURIAM.

</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Defendant was indicted for the murder of one Jake C. McKenzie on June 6, 1965. After a six-day trial the jury found him guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to State Prison for seven to ten years. He has appealed directly to this Court under <italic>R.R.</italic>
1:2-1(c).

The verdict was amply justified on the evidence, and no suggestion to the contrary is made on this review. In fact there was substantial evidence which would have supported a verdict of a higher degree of criminal homicide, if such conclusion had been reached by the jury.

The only ground of appeal asserted by defendant is that a portion of the trial court's charge on the subject of self-defense was erroneous. When such a criticism is made, an appellate tribunal does not treat excerpts from a charge in isolation; the charge is examined as a whole and if on such study prejudicial error does not appear the verdict must stand. <italic>State</italic><italic>v. Hipplewith, <cross_reference>33 N.J. 300</cross_reference></italic>, <cross_reference>317</cross_reference> (1960). We have examined the entire charge here, particularly as it deals with the matter of self-defense, and although it is not as clear or as comprehensive as it might have been, we cannot say that it reveals prejudicial error.

Affirmed.
