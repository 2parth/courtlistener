<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] G.H. appealed from a district court order for hospitalization and treatment which confined him to the North Dakota State Hospital for 90 days. The district court did not err in finding G.H. is a mentally ill and chemically dependent person in need of treatment and in finding alternative treatment to involuntary commitment at the state hospital is not appropriate. <underline>Interest of D.Z.</underline>, <cross_reference>2002 ND 132</cross_reference>, ¶¶ <cross_reference>10-12</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>649 N.W.2d 231</cross_reference>. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2).
