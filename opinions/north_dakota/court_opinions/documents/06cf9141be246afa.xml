<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Gerald Schmidt appealed from a judgment of conviction entered on a jury verdict finding him guilty of criminal trespass. Schmidt argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit certain evidence at trial and contends the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict. We affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(3) and (4).
