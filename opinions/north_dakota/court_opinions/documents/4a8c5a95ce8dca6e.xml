<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Anthony Moore appeals from the trial court's order dismissing his application for post-conviction relief filed on December 30, 2010. On appeal, Moore alleges North Dakota is in non-compliance with federal public law 109-248. Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. <cross_reference>109-248</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>120 Stat. 587</cross_reference> (codified at <cross_reference>42 U.S.C. §§ 16901</cross_reference>-<cross_reference>16991</cross_reference>
(2006)). Moore argues he is improperly categorized as a sex offender subject to a lifetime registration requirement, and he should be re-sentenced under federal public law 109-248 to a reduced registration requirement. We affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(6).
