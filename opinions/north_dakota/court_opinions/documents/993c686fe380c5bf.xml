</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  Anita Mayer appealed from a district court order denying her motion to vacate a December 30, 1999 stipulated divorce decree. Mayer asserts the stipulation upon which the divorce decree was based is unconscionable and was obtained as a result of undue influence or coercion by her former spouse against her. We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vacate the divorce decree, and we affirm the court's order under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(4) .
