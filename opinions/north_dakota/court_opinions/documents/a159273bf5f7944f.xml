<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Nikki Lyn Aipperspach appeals from a judgment of conviction for Abuse of Child in violation of section <cross_reference>14-09-22</cross_reference>, N.D.C.C., arguing the trial court erred in denying her pre-trial motion to suppress statements she made to law enforcement officers. We conclude the trial court's decision is based on findings of fact that are supported by sufficient competent evidence and is not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2).
