</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Carrie Ricker appealed from the criminal judgment and commitment and the district court's order denying her motion to suppress evidence found during a search of her purse. Ricker argues the district court erred in finding the search of her purse legal. She also argues the statements she made were obtained in violation of <underline>Miranda</underline> and were otherwise inadmissible because they were not voluntary. We will not reverse the trial court's decision to deny a suppression motion if there is sufficient competent evidence to support the court's findings and if the decision is not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. <underline>City</underline><underline>of Fargo v. Thompson</underline>, <cross_reference>520 N.W.2d 578</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>581</cross_reference> (N.D. 1994). Reviewing the record, we conclude the district court's finding Ricker was not in custody and the district court's finding regarding the voluntariness of Ricker's confessions were supported by sufficient competent evidence and were not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.

  [¶ 2] The district court's decision is affirmed under Rule 35.1(a)(2) and (3), N.D.R.App.P.
