<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Michael Steele appeals from a default judgment entered in favor of Cach, LLC. Steele was served with a summons and complaint in a debt-collection action, but he did not file an answer. Cach, LLC moved for default judgment, serving notice to Steele. Steele did not respond to the notice, and the district court granted summary judgment against him. On appeal, Steele argues his due process rights were violated. Steele also claims Cach, LLC violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

  [¶ 2] The exclusive means for opening a default judgment is N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Shull v. Walcker,<cross_reference>2009 ND 142</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>12</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>770 N.W.2d 274</cross_reference>. Steele did not file a motion for relief from judgment under N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Rather, he appealed directly to this Court, and we summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(7). <underline>See</underline> <underline>Flemming v.
