</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Andy Heinze appeals from a district court order granting Howard Venture, LLC's motion for summary judgment and the court's judgment ordering him to reimburse Howard Venture in the amount of $59,869.45. Heinze argues there was no verification of an overpayment, he did not receive proper notice of the hearing on Howard Venture's motion, and he was denied the right to a jury trial. We summarily affirm the district court's order and judgment under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(4) and (6).
