<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Troy Lehman appeals from the trial court's order dismissing his application for post-conviction relief. On appeal, Lehman proffers four grounds he claims constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. He argues his trial counsel failed to call relevant witnesses, inadequately cross-examined the State's witnesses, forced him to waive his right to testify, improperly allowed the information to be amended, and improperly waived his right to an arraignment and a preliminary hearing regarding a terrorizing charge.

  [¶ 2] We affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2).

  [¶ 3] Gerald W. VandeWalle, C.J.
