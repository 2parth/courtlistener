<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Scott Stockert appeals from an order denying his motion for a change of custody of the parties' child. Stockert argues the trial court erred in finding no significant change in circumstances. A party seeking modification of a custody order bears the burden of showing a significant change in circumstances.<underline>Krizan v. Krizan</underline>, <cross_reference>1998 ND 186</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>4</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>585 N.W.2d 576</cross_reference>. A trial court's custody modification decision "is a finding of fact subject to the `clearly erroneous' standard of review." <underline>Mosbrucker</underline><underline>v. Mosbrucker</underline>, <cross_reference>1997 ND 72</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>5</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>562 N.W.2d 390</cross_reference>. "Not every change in circumstances will amount to a `significant change' warranting a change or modification of custody." <underline>Id</underline>. at ¶ 6. We conclude the trial court did not err in finding there was no significant change of circumstances requiring a change of custody. We summarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(2).
