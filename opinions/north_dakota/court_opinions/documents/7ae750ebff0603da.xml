</opinion_byline>
<opinion_text>  [¶ 1] Patrick McMorrow, acting pro se, appeals from the district court's issuance of a domestic violence protection order. McMorrow argues the district court abused its discretion because there was no evidence presented to meet the statutory burden showing he had committed a recent incident of actual domestic violence.

  [¶ 2] An appellant has a duty, under N.D.R.App.P. 10, to provide this Court with a transcript sufficient to allow a meaningful and intelligent review of the alleged error. <underline>Leingang v. George</underline>, <cross_reference>1999 ND 32</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>7</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>589 N.W.2d 585</cross_reference>. If the record on appeal does not allow for a meaningful and intelligent review of an alleged error, we will decline review of the issue. <underline>Bublitz v. Tsang</underline>, <cross_reference>2000 ND 100</cross_reference>, ¶ <cross_reference>2</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>617 N.W.2d 131</cross_reference>. By failing to submit a transcript of the district court proceedings, McMorrow has failed to meet his burden of showing that the district court abused its discretion in issuing a domestic violence protection order. <underline>See</underline> <underline>id</underline>. at ¶ 3. The district court's issuance of a domestic violence protection order is summarily affirmed under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(7).
